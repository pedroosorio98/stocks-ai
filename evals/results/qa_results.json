This not only improves the effectiveness of ads but also drives revenue growth. AI systems can predict better than advertisers who would be interested in specific ads, and future advancements aim to allow AI to generate personalized creative content for ads ([INTERNAL | META-Q2-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf chunk 2], [WEB | fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2026/01/28/meta-q4-earnings-beat-mark-zuckerberg-ai-acceleration)).\n\n2. **Operational Efficiencies**: AI is also enabling operational efficiencies within Meta. AI recommendation systems are increasingly responsible for delivering a significant portion of content to users (e.g., 30% of Facebook feed posts and 50% of Instagram content), optimizing user engagement and ad placement based on user preferences to improve overall monetization efficiency ([INTERNAL | META-Q1-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf chunk 4 & 11]).\n\n3. **Business and Consumer AI**: Meta is integrating AI into its apps and exploring its potential in business communications. Business AIs are being expanded to answer product-related questions and assist with tasks within platforms like WhatsApp. For consumers, AI is enhancing the user experience by allowing easier content creation and more meaningful interactions ([INTERNAL | META-Q4-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf chunk 12], [INTERNAL | META-Q1-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript-1.pdf chunk 4]).\n\nThese AI advancements not only improve products and services but also prepare Meta to grow new types of services and markets, further solidifying its position in the tech industry.\n\n**Sources:**\n- INTERNAL: META-Q2-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript, META-Q1-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript, META-Q4-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript\n- WEB: [fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2026/01/28/meta-q4-earnings-beat-mark-zuckerberg-ai-acceleration)",
