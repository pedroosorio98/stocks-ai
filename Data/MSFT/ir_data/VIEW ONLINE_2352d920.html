<div class="container">
<p class="large">Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:</p>
<p>While the start of a new decade typically brings hope, we quickly saw the world come to a near standstill in 2020, confronted by compounding crises: a public health and economic crisis, persistent issues of systemic racial injustice and inequity, and the devastating effects of climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<article class="container">
<p>It is easy to fall prey to pessimism, or the sense that we individually or as a company can&rsquo;t make a difference. But helplessness is corrosive to hope, and hope plus work is what is required. Amid this disruption, what&rsquo;s clear is that we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to harness digital technology to define the world we want to live in. And for that, I am optimistic.</p>
<p>It is in times like these that our ability to stay true to Microsoft&rsquo;s mission and corporate purpose is of the utmost importance. As a company, we are steadfast in <strong>our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.</strong>&nbsp;Our mission is enduring. It drives who we are and everything we do, emphasizing our passion to empower both people and the lasting institutions they build. And it means we must always use technology to help address the world&rsquo;s challenges, not create new ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of how our ecosystem of customers and partners has stepped up over the past year to help people and organizations in every country use technology to be resilient and transform during the most trying of circumstances. We&rsquo;ve acted as digital first responders to the world&rsquo;s first responders, supporting those on the front lines, from healthcare, to education, to public sector, to critical manufacturing, grocery, and retail. And we&rsquo;re helping organizations navigate the response, recovery, and reimagine phases of the crisis, equipping them not only to stay open for business but to innovate. We&rsquo;ve witnessed years of digital transformation in mere months.</p>
<p>Amid this rapid change, we delivered strong results: Our commercial cloud surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time&mdash;up 36 percent year-over-year. All-up, we delivered $143 billion in revenue, $53 billion in operating income, and more than $60 billion in operating cash flow&mdash;and returned $35 billion to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>OUR OPPORTUNITY</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Although this year has taught us that no business is 100 percent resilient, those fortified by digital technology are more resilient and more capable of transforming when faced with sweeping changes like those we are experiencing. The way people interact with businesses is fundamentally shifting, and there is no going back. Digital technology is the most malleable tool ever created, and we believe that businesses that use it to build their own digital capability will recover faster and emerge stronger. At Microsoft, we call this dynamic <strong><em>tech intensity</em></strong>: adopting best-in-class digital tools and platforms for the purpose of building new, proprietary products and services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of so many people and organizations in every industry around the world applying tech intensity to address big challenges, including those created by COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>In healthcare, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6qy3N-ZVqw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Dr. Amanda Randles at Duke University</a> is using the power of Azure to conduct hundreds of millions of simulations required to help more patients have access to critical ventilators.</li>
<li>In the public sector,&nbsp;the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B55viclEWLc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=787">state of California</a> built 90 percent of its COVID-19 infrastructure with GitHub and Azure DevOps, reducing the time it takes to stand up a new website from 18 months to just three hours.</li>
<li>In telecom, two analysts at <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/B55viclEWLc?t=930">T-Mobile</a>&nbsp;used Power Platform to build an app that helped the company keep retail associates employed and keep customers, including first responders, connected during the critical first weeks of the crisis.</li>
<li>In retail,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/B55viclEWLc?t=1217">Patagonia</a> is using Dynamics 365 to ship inventory directly from a store or from a warehouse, optimizing to send single shipments to customers, while reducing the load on all locations.</li>
<li>In education, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/04/08/learning-from-customers-italy/">University of Bologna in Italy</a> moved 90 percent of courses for its 80,000 students online to Microsoft Teams within three days&mdash;a first in the university&rsquo;s 900-plus year history.</li>
<li>And, in sports, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/24/reimagining-teams-experience-basketball-microsoft-teams/">the NBA</a> is using our technology to reimagine the game experience so fans can feel like they&rsquo;re together from the safety of their homes and players can experience the energy of cheering fans&mdash;virtually&mdash;in the arena.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are living in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, which is being shaped by rapid advances in distributed computing, ambient intelligence, and multisense, multidevice experiences. This means the places we go and the things we interact with will increasingly become digitized, creating new opportunities and new breakthroughs: from precision medicine to precision agriculture, from personalized e-commerce to personalized education, and from connected manufacturing floors to connected homes.</p>
<p>Our collective opportunity is to channel this intelligent cloud and intelligent edge era into tech intensity for every organization on the planet. Our customer solution areas were built for this era. They enable people, organizations, and entire industries to not only thrive but reimagine the world. So organizations can empower their employees, fostering a new culture for hybrid work; engage customers intelligently and virtually; transform products with new business models; and optimize operations to keep customers and employees safe and secure.</p>
<p>Across our customer solution areas, we are expanding our opportunity to help every organization in every industry build their tech intensity&mdash;with a business model that is trusted and aligned with their success.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Applications and Infrastructure</em></p>
<p>More than ever, organizations are relying on Azure to stay up and running and support critical workloads, from healthcare triage with AI-assisted bots, to digital twins in manufacturing, to e-commerce in retail. Today, leaders in every industry&mdash;including 95 percent of the Fortune 500&mdash;run on Azure. We are building Azure as the world&rsquo;s computer to support them, with more datacenter regions than any other provider&mdash; now 61.</p>
<p>Fifty billion devices will come online by 2030, and Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge, with consistency across operating models, development models, and infrastructure stack. Azure Arc enables organizations to deploy Azure services anywhere and extend Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Stack Edge brings rapid machine learning inferencing closer to where data is generated, including the harshest of conditions, like disaster response. Our acquisitions of Affirmed and Metaswitch, along with new Azure Edge Zones, expand our offerings for telecom operators as they move to 5G. And, with Azure Orbital, we&rsquo;re taking our infrastructure to space, enabling anyone to access satellite data and capabilities from Azure.</p>
<p><em>Data and AI</em></p>
<p>There will be 175 zettabytes of data by 2025, and processing this data in real time will be an imperative for every organization. At the data layer, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities. Azure Synapse brings together big data analytics and data warehousing, enabling data scientists to generate immediate insights from structured and unstructured data. And together with Azure SQL Hyperscale, Cosmos DB, and our other data services, we are able to deliver a cloud-native data estate for every organization.<em> </em></p>
<p>In AI, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks, and infrastructure. Azure Cognitive Services makes it easier to build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making. Azure Machine Learning helps organizations build and deploy models faster, while ensuring they can do so responsibly and safely. And, we are pushing the bounds of how AI can generalize learning beyond narrow domains, collaborating with OpenAI on a supercomputing platform to train and run AI models of unprecedented scale. Their new GPT-3 model was trained on our Azure AI supercomputer and constitutes a new breakthrough in natural language understanding and generation, promising breakthrough scenarios within our products and those of our customers, when safely deployed.</p>
<p><em>Developer Tools</em></p>
<p>Today, the majority of job openings for developers are outside the tech sector, and developers will increasingly drive and influence every business process and function. We have the most used and loved developer tools to build any app for any platform. With the world&rsquo;s most popular code editing tools&mdash;Visual Studio and VS Code&mdash;developers are more productive than ever. With GitHub, more than 50 million developers across 3 million organizations, including the majority of the Fortune 50, are able to collaborate and build software together. And, with Azure, they have best-in-class services to build cloud-native apps and modernize existing ones.</p>
<p>This year, we went further to give developers new tools to power remote development, productivity, and collaboration, wherever they are. Codespaces brings together the best of GitHub, Visual Studio, and Azure to help developers go from code to cloud in seconds. VS Live Share enables real-time collaboration between developers, regardless of their location. And with Azure Communications Services, any developer can integrate rich communications APIs into their applications across any device, on any platform, using the same reliable and secure infrastructure that powers Teams.</p>
<p><em>Power Platform</em></p>
<p>500 million apps will be created by 2023 to drive transformation and productivity for every organization. To accelerate this, we must enable a new category of developers&mdash;citizen developers&mdash;equipping domain experts with tools that are low-code or no-code to create solutions that solve their unique business needs and help them better collaborate with professional developers. With Power Platform, anyone can become a citizen developer, able to create an application, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow, and analyze data in hours or days, not weeks or months.</p>
<p>Power BI is the clear leader in business intelligence in the cloud. Power Virtual Agents enables anyone to build an intelligent bot with just a point and click. And Power Automate enables customers to automate manual business processes across both legacy and modern applications.</p>
<p><em>Modern Workplace </em></p>
<p>Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working and learning. The PC has been mission-critical across work, school, and life to sustain productivity in a remote everything world. More than 1 billion active devices now run Windows 10, and Office 365 usage is higher than ever. New Microsoft Edge&mdash;with enterprise-class security&mdash;protects individuals&rsquo; privacy online and makes it easier to find information at work. And with Surface, we are reimagining every layer of the stack&mdash;from how we infuse AI from the silicon up, to device form factors, to the role of operating systems&mdash;investing across form and function to create new device categories.</p>
<p>The past six months have served as the largest at-scale experiment we&rsquo;ve ever seen for remote work. We&rsquo;ve been studying this closely to understand the changing nature of productivity and are applying these learnings to inform how we build our products. We think about the future of work through three vectors. First, we are creating a system of collaboration for every organization. Work doesn&rsquo;t begin and end inside a meeting, and with Teams, we are focused on the entire workflow around a meeting&mdash;before, during, and after. It&rsquo;s the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration with Office, and business process workflows, in a secure, integrated user experience. Second, learning in the flow of work will be increasingly important. A new Teams app will help organizations skill, reskill, and upskill employees, surfacing learning content from LinkedIn Learning and other content providers. Finally, prioritizing employee well-being is core to an organization&rsquo;s success. New capabilities like Together mode in Teams help reduce cognitive load, while a new &ldquo;virtual commute&rdquo; will provide much-needed structure for the remote workday.</p>
<p><em>Business Applications</em></p>
<p>Dynamics 365 is helping organizations in every industry digitize their business operations and make every part of their operations remote, from manufacturing, to supply-chain management, to sales and customer service, including new scenarios like contactless shopping. As much as 73 percent of the data in the world is still not being analyzed. And from Dynamics 365 Customer Insights for personalized customer experiences and Dynamics 365 Commerce for omnichannel retail, Dynamics 365 is the only AI-powered business cloud that gives customers a 360-degree view of their business to unify data and unlock insights. And the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 gives sales professionals tools for more effective remote selling.</p>
<p>Amid a rapidly changing jobs market, LinkedIn&rsquo;s role in creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce has never been more acute. LinkedIn is where more than 706 million professionals around the world go to connect, learn, and plan for the future. People are turning to LinkedIn Learning more than ever to acquire new skills. And we are helping organizations attract, retain, and develop the best talent with our portfolio of Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, and Glint.</p>
<p><em>Security </em></p>
<p>Identity, security, management, and compliance underlie our entire tech stack. Cybercrime will cost businesses, governments, and individuals $1 trillion this year, and the shift to remote everything has only increased the need for a &ldquo;Zero Trust&rdquo; architecture that reduces both cost and complexity. We are the only company that offers integrated, end-to-end capabilities to protect people and organizations.</p>
<p>In identity, Azure Active Directory now provides identity and access management to more than 345 million monthly active users across more than 200,000 organizations. In security, Defender offers broad coverage, spanning identities, cloud apps, devices, IoT, and more. It complements Azure Sentinel, which analyzes security signals across the entire organization, using AI to detect, investigate, and automatically remediate threats. In device and data management, Microsoft Endpoint Manager monitors and manages an organization&rsquo;s devices in a unified management platform. And, in compliance, we provide tools to help organizations govern their data and comply with increasing regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><em>Gaming</em></p>
<p>Gaming is the most expansive category in the entertainment industry. Three billion people around the world look to gaming for entertainment, community, and achievement, and our ambition is to empower each of them, wherever they play. We saw record engagement and monetization this year, led by strength on and off console, as people everywhere turn to gaming to connect, socialize, and play with their friends during a time of social distancing.</p>
<p>Our Xbox Game Pass service now has more than 15 million subscribers. Quality differentiated content&mdash; from <em>Flight Simulator</em> to <em>Minecraft</em>&mdash;is the engine behind the service&rsquo;s growth, and our pending acquisition of ZeniMax Media, one of the world&rsquo;s largest, privately held game developers and publishers, will add iconic franchises to the more than 100 high-quality games already available. We&rsquo;re also transforming how games are distributed, played, and viewed, bringing cloud gaming to Game Pass, so subscribers can stream games to a phone or tablet and play along with nearly 100 million Xbox Live players.<br><br><strong>OUR</strong> <strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>As we pursue our mission, we also recognize our enormous responsibility to ensure the technology we build benefits everyone on the planet, including the planet itself. Our customers see this urgent need and are looking to us&mdash;in partnership with them&mdash;to take action. We&rsquo;re committed to working across the public and private sectors to foster partnerships and solutions that will have lasting impact and redefine what &ldquo;achieve more&rdquo; means for the world. For us, &ldquo;achieve more&rdquo; has four important attributes:</p>
<p><em>Support inclusive economic opportunity</em></p>
<p>First, we must ensure that the economic growth we drive is&nbsp;<em>inclusive</em>. This starts with protecting public health. COVID-19 has underscored that without a healthy society, we cannot sustain a healthy economy. That&rsquo;s why, through our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-health">AI for Health</a> initiative, we&rsquo;re empowering those working to tackle some of the toughest challenges in global health, including those on the front lines of COVID-19 research.</p>
<p>It also requires that we equip everyone with the skills, technology, and opportunity to pursue the in-demand jobs of a changing economy. We&rsquo;re accelerating efforts to close the skills and broadband gaps, ensuring underrepresented and overlooked communities can compete on equal ground. COVID-19 has intensified the need for these efforts, forcing tens of millions of people out of work. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re bringing together assets from across Microsoft, inclusive of LinkedIn and GitHub, to help <a href="https://aka.ms/skills">25 million job seekers</a> gain digital skills for in-demand roles. We are also working to expand broadband access to 40 million unserved and underserved people in rural areas globally, and to 3 million people in unserved and rural communities in the US by July 2022.</p>
<p>We also prioritize accessibility in our culture, products, and services, ensuring we use technology to design a more accessible world for the 1 billion-plus people around the world with disabilities. As we continue our own accessibility journey, we seek to inspire and enable others to advance theirs, including through our five-year investment in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility">AI for Accessibility</a>.</p>
<p>Nonprofits are on the front lines of solving some of the world&rsquo;s most pressing challenges. We make our technology affordable and accessible to nonprofit organizations around the world, enabling them to drive greater impact for the causes and communities they serve. This year, we provided $1.9 billion in donated or discounted products and services to help 243,000 nonprofits better serve their communities. And our employees donated an additional $221 million (including company match) through our employee giving program to the organizations and causes they care about.</p>
<p><em>Protect fundamental rights</em></p>
<p>Second, we unequivocally support&nbsp;the <em>fundamental rights of all people</em>, from defending democracy to addressing systemic racial injustice and inequity around the world. Recent events are shining a bright light on how much work there is still to do. Seeing injustice in the world calls us all to take action.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity for the Black and African American community in the United States and for vulnerable communities globally. This starts with our own culture at Microsoft, extends to how we engage our suppliers and partners to create change, and includes strengthening our communities. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/23/addressing-racial-injustice/">Our efforts</a> include investing an additional $150 million to advance racial justice and includes work on our own cultural transformation, doubling the number of Black-owned suppliers in our ecosystem, doubling the percentage of our transaction volumes through Black-owned financial institutions, and accelerating our justice reform initiatives.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t stop there. Democracy itself is under attack. That&rsquo;s why we are helping protect the integrity of our democratic processes and institutions around the world through our <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/topic/defending-democracy-program/">Defending Democracy Program</a>, which works with governments, NGOs, academics, and industry to explore technological solutions to preserve and protect electoral processes and to defend against disinformation.</p>
<p><em>Commit to a sustainable future</em></p>
<p>Third, we must protect our most finite resource&mdash;the planet&mdash;by working toward a more&nbsp;<em>sustainable future</em><em>.</em> Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve set <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/products-services-devices">ambitious climate goals</a> and outlined detailed plans to achieve them, including to be carbon negative, zero waste, and water positive by 2030. We are also building a new planetary computing platform to help manage Earth&rsquo;s natural systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing the climate crisis is good for the planet and good for Microsoft. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re innovating and empowering customers, partners, NGOs, and governments around the world with technology to help them set and achieve their own climate goals, including the creation of a $1 billion <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/climate-innovation-fund">Climate Innovation Fund</a> to accelerate innovation.</p>
<p><em>Earn trust</em></p>
<p>Finally, we are committed to building&nbsp;<em>trust</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in technology and its use. Without trust, none of our progress is possible. For Microsoft, trust is built on privacy, security, the responsible use of AI, and transparency.</p>
<p>Our approach to privacy and data protection is grounded in our belief that customers own their own data. Our privacy principles include a commitment to be transparent in our privacy practices, to offer meaningful privacy choices, and to responsibly manage the data we store and process. It&rsquo;s why we were early supporters of the European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and why we were the first major technology company to expand GDPR&rsquo;s core rights to all our customers around the world. To date, more than 43 million people have visited these tools.</p>
<p>Security is a central challenge in the digital age. In an increasingly complex world, technology alone is not enough to combat increasing threats. It also requires partnerships, both with governments and industries. Our Digital Crimes Unit&mdash;an international team of technical, legal, and business experts&mdash;has coordinated with partners across countries to disrupt threats targeting governments, universities, human rights organizations, individuals, and more. This year, for example, they took control of domains being used to send COVID-19-themed phishing emails in 62 countries.</p>
<p>AI has proved itself to be a powerful tool for tackling the kinds of challenges that this year has highlighted. However, when we build AI, we must do so responsibly, taking a principled approach and asking difficult questions, like not what technology can do, but what should it do? Fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability are the ethical principles that guide our work and advocacy. Our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/our-approach">Office of Responsible AI</a> helps ensure our products adhere to these principles. We&rsquo;ve released guidelines, software development tools, and other resources to enable our developer community to do the same.</p>
<p>Finally, transparency is foundational&nbsp;to&nbsp;trust, so we provide clear information on how we run our business and how we work with customers and partners.&nbsp;We provide details on our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-responsibility/reports-hub">CSR Reports Hub</a>&nbsp;covering everything from law enforcement access to data, to environmental data, details on our political activities,&nbsp;workforce demographics, and human rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OUR CULTURE</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, we will only achieve our mission if we live our culture. It is at the root of every decision we make. We fundamentally believe that we need a culture founded in a growth mindset. It starts with a belief that everyone can grow and develop; that potential is nurtured, not predetermined; and that anyone can change their mindset. It&rsquo;s not by claiming a growth mindset but by knowing that we are imperfect but can learn and get better that we can close the gap between our espoused culture and the lived experience for every employee at the company.<br><br>Our success is dependent on our customers&rsquo; success, and we need to obsess about them&mdash;listening and then innovating to meet their unmet and unarticulated needs. No customer of ours cares about our organizational boundaries, and we need to operate as One Microsoft to deliver the best solutions for them. Finally, we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers around the world and create a culture where everyone can do their best work. Diversity and inclusion &nbsp;continues to be a core priority for every employee at Microsoft as part of our annual performance and development approach. This past year, we expanded our global allyship program, adapting learning experiences for the work from home conditions of COVID-19. As we reflect on our opportunity to address racial injustice, we announced our aspiration to increase representation and strengthen our culture of inclusion, including a commitment to double the number of Black and African American and Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the US by 2025.<br><br>If we commit to being customer obsessed, operating as One Microsoft, and becoming more diverse and inclusive, I believe there is no limit to what we can achieve.</p>
<p>The world is at an inflection point, and digital technology will be key to defining what comes next. Over the next decade, technology spending as a percentage of gross domestic product is projected to double. And, we are well positioned to not only participate in that growth but drive it by expanding our impact and building the key technologies that empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.</p>

<p>Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. As the world responds to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (âCOVID-19â), we are working to do our part by ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote.</p>
<p>We continue to transform our business to lead in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our unique role as a platform and tools provider allows us to connect the dots, bring together an ecosystem of partners, and enable organizations of all sizes to build the digital capability required to address these challenges.</p>
<p>In this next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (âAIâ) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together with the Internet of Things (âIoTâ) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. A personâs experience with technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions.</p>
<p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential.</p>
<p>We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.</p>
<p>Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; and video games. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.</p>
<p><strong>The Ambitions That Drive Us</strong></p>
<p>To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinvent productivity and business processes.</li>
<li>Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.</li>
<li>Create more personal computing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes</em></strong></p>
<p>At Microsoft, weâre providing technology and resources to help our customers navigate a remote environment. Weâre seeing our family of products play key roles in the ways the world is continuing to work, learn, and connect.</p>
<p>Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is enabling rapid digital transformation by giving people a single tool to chat, call, meet, and collaborate. Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics to transform business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise.</p>
<p>These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and management. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform</em></strong></p>
<p>In the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees, optimize their operations, engage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services. Partnering with organizations on their digital transformation during this period is one of our largest opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital transformation platform and partner of choice; their success is our success.</p>
<p>Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.</p>
<p>Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.</p>
<p>As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans identity, data, compute, management, and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads which we believe will shape the next era of computing.</p>
<p>The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science.</p>
<p><strong><em>Create More Personal Computing</em></strong></p>
<p>We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. In support of this, we are bringing Office, Windows, and devices together for an enhanced and more cohesive customer experience.</p>
<p>Windows 10 serves the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with AI-first interfaces ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and mixed reality experiences. Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the âintelligent edge.â</p>
<p>We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We recently added several new products and accessories into the Surface family, including Surface Book 3 and Surface Go 2. These new Surface products join Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3, and Surface Pro X.</p>
<p>To expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we pursue the expansive opportunity in the gaming industry. We are broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers. Xbox Game Pass, with over 10 million members from 41 countries, is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Project xCloud is Microsoftâs game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and will give fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Future Opportunity</em></strong></p>
<p>In a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations as software and cloud computing play a huge role across every industry and around the world. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.</li>
<li>Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.</li>
<li>Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customerâs behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.</li>
<li>Using Windows to fuel our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and to develop new categories of devices â both our own and third-party â on the intelligent edge.</li>
<li>Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Refer to Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2020 financial results.</p>
<p>The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individualsâ actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customersâ ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects managementâs accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment to Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. Weâre empowering our customers and partners with new technology to help them drive efficiencies, transform their businesses, and create their own solutions for sustainability. In January 2020, we announced a bold new environmental sustainability strategy focused on carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. As part of our commitment, we are investing $1 billion over the next four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We set an ambitious goal to reduce and ultimately remove Microsoftâs carbon footprint. By 2030 Microsoft will be carbon negative, and by 2050 Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975. We also launched a new initiative to use Microsoft technology to help our suppliers and customers around the world reduce their own carbon footprint.</p>
<p>The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. We also pledged a $50 million investment in AI for Earth to accelerate innovation by putting AI in the hands of those working to directly address sustainability challenges. Lastly, this work is supported by using our voice to support policies we think can advance sustainability efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing Racial Injustice</strong></p>
<p>Our future opportunity depends on reaching and empowering all communities, and we are committed to taking action to help address racial injustice and inequity. With significant input from employees and leaders who are members of the Black and African American community, our senior leadership team and board of directors has developed a set of actions to help improve the lived experience at Microsoft and drive change in the communities in which we live and work. These efforts include increasing our representation and culture of inclusion by doubling the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025; engaging our ecosystem by using our balance sheet and engagement with suppliers and partners to extend the vision for societal change; and strengthening our communities by using the power of data, technology, and partnership to help improve the lives of Black and African American citizens across the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Investing in Digital Skills</strong></p>
<p>With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is making efforts to help ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly vital to many of the worldâs jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses, including those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedInâs Economic Graph. This is combined with $20 million we are investing in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies.</p>

<li><em>Cloud and AI</em>, focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.</li>
<li><em>Experiences and Devices</em>, focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including Office, Windows, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Surface.</li>
<li><em>AI and Research</em>, focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search.</li>
<li><em>LinkedIn</em>, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.</li>
<li><em>Gaming</em>, focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.</p>
<p>We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 63,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 24,500 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licenseesâ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.</p>
<p>While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.</p>
<p><strong>Investing in the Future</strong></p>
<p>Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems.</p>
<p>While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Czech Republic, India, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.</p>
<p>In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the worldâs largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation.</p>
<p>We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the Company. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts.</p>

<h3>DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING</h3>
<p>We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>OEMs</strong></p>
<p>We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Direct</strong></p>
<p>Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (âEnterprise Agreement Software Advisorsâ or âESAâ). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.</p>
<p>We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In June 2020, we announced a strategic change in our retail operations, including closing our Microsoft Store physical locations.</p>
<p><strong>Distributors and Resellers</strong></p>
<p>Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (âLSPâ), distributors, value-added resellers (âVARâ), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.</p>
<p>We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support.</p>
<p>Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services.</p>
</article>
<article class="container" id="licensing-options">
<h3>LICENSING OPTIONS</h3>
<p>We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and Software Assurance. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.</p>
<p>SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.</p>
<p><strong>Volume Licensing Programs</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Enterprise Agreement</em></strong></p>
<p>Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.</p>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft Product and Services Agreement</em></strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Product and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses.</p>
<p><strong><em>Open</em></strong></p>
<p>Open agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open agreements, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included.</p>
<p><strong><em>Select Plus</em></strong></p>
<p>Select Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional.</p>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement</em></strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.</p>
<p><strong>Partner Programs</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption.</p>
<p>The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.</p>

<h2>Discussion &amp; Analysis</h2>
<h3 class="large">MANAGEMENTâS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h3>
<p>The following Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (âMD&amp;Aâ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.</p>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.</p>
<p>We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.</p>
<p>As the world responds to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (âCOVID-19â), we are working to do our part by ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote.</p>
<p>Highlights from fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial cloud revenue increased 36% to $51.7 billion.</li>
<li>Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 12%, driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 24%.</li>
<li>Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11%, with continued growth in Office 365 Consumer subscribers to 42.7 million.</li>
<li>LinkedIn revenue increased 20%.</li>
<li>Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 14%, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 42%.</li>
<li>Server products and cloud services revenue increased 27%, driven by Azure growth of 56%.</li>
<li>Enterprise Services revenue increased 5%.</li>
<li>Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 18%.</li>
<li>Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (âWindows OEMâ) revenue increased 9%.</li>
<li>Surface revenue increased 8%.</li>
<li>Xbox content and services revenue increased 11%.</li>
<li>Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, was relatively unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Industry Trends</strong></p>
<p>Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks</strong></p>
<p>The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the userâs choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.</p>
<p>Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow oneâs career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.</p>
<p>Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019, and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2020.</p>
<p>Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>In fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and we saw the following trends in our financial operating results. In the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments, cloud usage and demand increased as customers shifted to work and learn from home. We also experienced a slowdown in transactional licensing, particularly in small and medium businesses, and LinkedIn was negatively impacted by the weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. In the More Personal Computing segment, Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefited from increased demand to support remote work-, play-, and learn-from-home scenarios, while Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time.</p>
<p>The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individualsâ actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customersâ ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects managementâs accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonality</strong></p>
<p>Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.</p>
<p><strong>Reportable Segments</strong></p>
<p>We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&amp;A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âGAAPâ), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other.</p>
<p>Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 â Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong></p>
<p>We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements. Financial metrics are calculated based on GAAP results and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong><em>Commercial</em></strong></p>
<p>Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019</em></strong></p>
<p>Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower yields, offset in part by higher average portfolio balances on fixed-income securities. Interest expense decreased due to capitalization of interest expense and a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities, offset in part by debt exchange transaction fees and higher finance lease expense. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains and higher other-than-temporary impairments on equity investments, offset in part by gains on fixed income securities in the current period compared to losses in the prior period. Net gains on derivatives increased due to higher gains on foreign exchange and equity derivatives.</p>

Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity investments. Net gains on derivatives includes gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period.</p>
<h3>INCOME TAXES</h3>
<p><strong>Effective Tax Rate</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019</em></strong></p>
<p>Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was 17% and 10%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.</p>
<p>The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2020, our U.S. income before income taxes was $24.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $28.9 billion. In fiscal year 2019, our U.S. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018</em></strong></p>
<p>Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10% and 55%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2019, our U.S. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. In fiscal year 2018, our U.S. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</strong></p>
<p>On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 12 â Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertain Tax Positions</strong></p>
<p>We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. In April 2020, the IRS commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.</p>
<p>We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h3>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</h3>
<p>Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties in fiscal year 2019 and the net tax impact of the TCJA in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>

<h3>FINANCIAL CONDITION</h3>
<p><strong>Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments</strong></p>
<p>Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $136.5 billion and $133.8 billion as of June 30, 2020 and 2019. Equity investments were $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.</p>
<p><strong>Valuation</strong></p>
<p>In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.</p>
<p>A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Flows</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019</em></strong></p>
<p>Cash from operations increased $8.5 billion to $60.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to an increase in cash from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash used to pay income taxes, suppliers, and employees. Cash used in financing increased $9.1 billion to $46.0 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $3.4 billion cash premium on our debt exchange, a $3.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases, a $1.5 billion increase in repayments of debt, and a $1.3 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $3.6 billion to $12.2 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and $1.2 billion in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018</em></strong></p>
<p>Cash from operations increased $8.3 billion to $52.2 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes. Cash used in financing increased $3.3 billion to $36.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an $8.8 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.2 billion decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds from issuance of debt. Cash used in investing increased $9.7 billion to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to a $6.0 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets.</p>
<p><strong>Debt</strong></p>
<p>We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. Refer to Note 11 â Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Unearned Revenue</strong></p>
<p>Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (âSAâ) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 â Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.</p>
<p>The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2020:</p>

<p><strong>Share Repurchases</strong></p>
<p>For fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we repurchased 126 million shares, 150 million shares, and 99 million shares of our common stock for $19.7 billion, $16.8 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs.

Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.

<p><strong>Other Planned Uses of Capital</strong></p>
<p>We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $3.2 billion, which included $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2020. The remaining transition tax of $15.2 billion is payable over the next six years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026. During fiscal year 2020, we also paid $3.7 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.</p>
<p>We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h3>APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h3>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managementâs application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Recognition</strong></p>
<p>Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.</p>
<p>Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (âSSPâ) for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.</p>
<p>In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.</p>
<p>Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.</p>
<p>Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.</p>
<p><strong>Impairment of Investment Securities</strong></p>
<p>We review debt investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.</p>
<p>Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.</p>
<p><strong>Goodwill</strong></p>
<p>We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.</p>
<p>Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.</p>
<p>The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Development Costs</strong></p>
<p>Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.</p>
<p><strong>Legal and Other Contingencies</strong></p>
<p>The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Income Taxes</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entityâs financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 12 â Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Inventories</strong></p>
<p>Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.</p>
<h3>CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE</h3>
<p>In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in âProperty and equipment, netâ as of June 30, 2020, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2021 operating income by $2.7 billion.</p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTâS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on managementâs estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p>The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.</p>
<p>The Company engaged Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).</p>
<p>The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.</p>

<h2>QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<h3>RISKS</h3>
<p>We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Currencies</strong></p>
<p>Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.</p>
<p><strong>Interest Rate</strong></p>
<p>Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.</p>
<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>
<p>Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p>Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<strong>NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong>
<h3>NOTE 1 â ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h3>
<p><strong>Accounting Principles</strong></p>
<p>Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âGAAPâ).</p>
<p>We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Consolidation</strong></p>
<p>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Estimates and Assumptions</strong></p>
<p>Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (âSSPâ) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managementâs estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (âCOVID-19â).</p>
<p>In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Currencies</strong></p>
<p>Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue</em></strong></p>
<p>Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.</p>
<p>Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Revenue Recognition</em></strong></p>
<p>Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.</p>
<p><em>Nature of Products and Services</em></p>
<p>Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.</p>
<p>Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (âSAâ). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.</p>
<p>Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.</p>
<p>Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.</p>
<p>Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 19 â Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.</p>
<p><em>Significant Judgments</em></p>
<p>Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.</p>
<p>Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.</p>
<p>In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.</p>
<p>Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.</p>
<p>Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.</p>
<p><strong><em>Contract Balances</em></strong></p>
<p>Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.</p>
<p>Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:</p>

<p>Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; LinkedIn subscriptions; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Windows 10 post-delivery support; Dynamics business solutions; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.</p>
<p>Refer to Note 13 â Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.</p>
<p>Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.</p>
<p>We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, our financing receivables, net were $5.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer</em></strong></p>
<p>We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Revenue</strong></p>
<p>Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (âOEMâ), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.</p>
<p><strong>Product Warranty</strong></p>
<p>We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Development</strong></p>
<p>Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.</p>
<p><strong>Sales and Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Stock-Based Compensation</strong></p>
<p>Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (âRSUsâ) and performance stock units (âPSUsâ), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.</p>
<p>Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (âESPPâ) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Income Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Instruments</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Investments</em></strong></p>
<p>We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.</p>
<p>Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook, for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.</p>
<p>Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.</p>
<p><strong><em>Derivatives</em></strong></p>
<p>Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.</p>
<p>For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.</p>
<p>For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.</p>
<p>For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.</p>
<p><strong>Fair Value Measurements</strong></p>
<p>We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Level 1</em> â inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.</li>
<li><em>Level 2</em> â inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.</li>
<li><em>Level 3</em> â inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managementâs estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.</p>
<p>Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.</p>
<p><strong>Inventories</strong></p>
<p>Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Property and Equipment</strong></p>
<p>Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Leases</strong></p>
<p>We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (âROUâ) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.</p>
<p>We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Goodwill</strong></p>
<p>Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.</p>
<p><strong>Intangible Assets</strong></p>
<p>Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Accounting Guidance</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Financial Instruments â Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities</em></p>
<p>In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (âFASBâ) issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2019. As we did not hold derivative instruments requiring an adjustment upon adoption, there was no impact in our consolidated financial statements. Adoption of the standard enhanced the presentation of the effects of our hedging instruments and the hedged items in our consolidated financial statements to increase the understandability of the results of our hedging strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Financial Instruments â Credit Losses</em></p>
<p>In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning July 1, 2020. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. We have evaluated the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. We continue to monitor economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on current market conditions, adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p><em>Accounting for Income Taxes</em></p>
<p>In December 2019, the FASB issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems.</p>

<h3>NOTE 2 â EARNINGS PER SHARE</h3>
<p>Basic earnings per share (âEPSâ) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.</p>
<p>The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:</p>

<h3>NOTE 5 â DERIVATIVES</h3>
<p>We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign Currencies</strong></p>
<p>Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.</p>
<p>Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.</p>
<p>In the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged included the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.</p>
<p>Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.</p>
<p><strong>Interest Rate</strong></p>
<p>Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.</p>
<p>Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in âOther contractsâ in the tables below.</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p>Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in âOther contractsâ in the tables below.</p>
<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>
<p>Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in âOther contractsâ in the tables below.</p>
<p><strong>Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features</strong></p>
<p>Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2020, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.</p>
<p>The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents:</p>

<h3>NOTE 8 â BUSINESS COMBINATIONS</h3>
<p><strong>GitHub, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>On October 25, 2018, we acquired GitHub, Inc. (âGitHubâ), a software development platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an indemnity escrow). The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of GitHub, and bring Microsoftâs developer tools and services to new audiences. The financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. GitHub is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment.</p>

<p>The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.</p>
<p>Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as âOtherâ in the table above. Also included in âOtherâ are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Goodwill Impairment</strong></p>
<p>We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.</p>
<p>No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2020, May 1, 2019, or May 1, 2018 tests. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.</p>

<h3>NOTE 12 â INCOME TAXES</h3>
<p><strong>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</strong></p>
<p>On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (âTCJAâ) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (âGILTIâ) tax.</p>

<p>The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 86% of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82% and 87% of our foreign income before tax, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax. In fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.</p>
<p>The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers.</p>

<p>Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $547 million, $975 million, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2021 through 2040, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.</p>
<p>The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $12.5 billion, $8.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertain Tax Positions</strong></p>
<p>Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were $13.8 billion, $13.1 billion, and $12.0 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 by $12.1 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.3 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $4.0 billion, $3.4 billion, and $3.0 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $579 million, $515 million, and $688 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.</p>

<p>We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. In April 2020, the IRS commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.</p>
<p>We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>As of June 30, 2020, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 1 year to 16 years.</p>
<p>During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $161 million to operating lease right-of-use assets due to the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations.</p>

<h3>NOTE 15 â CONTINGENCIES</h3>
<p><strong>Patent and Intellectual Property Claims</strong></p>
<p>There were 64 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2020, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions</strong></p>
<p>Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.</p>
<p>The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. The final settlement has been approved by the courts in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and the claims administration process will commence once each court approves the form of notice to the class.</p>
<p><strong>Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigation</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2014, Microsoft was informed that Chinaâs State Agency for Market Regulation (âSAMRâ) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to Chinaâs Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. The SAMR has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of Chinaâs Anti-Monopoly Law, and discussions are expected to continue.</p>
<p><strong>Product-Related Litigation</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>U.S. Cell Phone Litigation</em></strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokiaâs Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (âFCC Guidelinesâ) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.</p>
<p>In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffsâ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendantsâ motion to exclude the plaintiffsâ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffsâ expert reports. A hearing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Other Contingencies</strong></p>
<p>We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managementâs view of these matters may change in the future.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2020, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $306 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.</p>

<h3>NOTE 19 â SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA</h3>
<p>In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.</p>
<p>Our reportable segments are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity and Business Processes</strong></p>
<p>Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions, the Office portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (âCALsâ).</li>
<li>Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer (formerly Office 365 Consumer) subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.</li>
<li>LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Learning Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.</li>
<li>Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM, Dynamics ERP on-premises, and Dynamics CRM on-premises.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intelligent Cloud</strong></p>
<p>Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs; and GitHub.</li>
<li>Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Personal Computing</strong></p>
<p>Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Internet of Things; and MSN advertising.</li>
<li>Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.</li>
<li>Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising Xbox Live (transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising), video games, and third-party video game royalties.</li>
<li>Search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.</p>
<p>In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments.</p>
<p>Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:</p>

<h2>Auditor's Report</h2>
<p><strong>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM</strong></p>
<p>To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p><strong>Opinion on the Financial Statements</strong></p>
<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the âCompanyâ) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholdersâ equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the âfinancial statementsâ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 30, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Basis for Opinion</strong></p>
<p>These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companyâs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companyâs financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Audit Matters</strong></p>
<p>The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Revenue Recognition â Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Critical Audit Matter Description</em></p>
<p>The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.</p>
<p>Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.</li>
<li>The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.</li>
<li>Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).</li>
<li>Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating managementâs judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.</p>
<p><em>How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit</em></p>
<p>Our principal audit procedures related to the Companyâs revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.</li>
<li>We evaluated managementâs significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.</li>
<li>We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:</li>
<ul>
<li>Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.</li>
<li>Tested managementâs identification and treatment of contract terms.</li>
<li>Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of managementâs application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<li>We evaluated the reasonableness of managementâs estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.</li>
<li>We tested the mathematical accuracy of managementâs calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Income Taxes â Uncertain Tax Positions â Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Critical Audit Matter Description</em></p>
<p>The Companyâs long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Companyâs financial statements.</p>
<p>Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating managementâs estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.</p>
<p><em>How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit</em></p>
<p>Our principal audit procedures to evaluate managementâs estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of managementâs methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.</li>
<li>We read and evaluated managementâs documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.</li>
<li>We tested the reasonableness of managementâs judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.</li>
<li>For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.</li>
<li>We evaluated the reasonableness of managementâs estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted managementâs judgments.</li>

<p><strong>CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<h3>CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h3>
<p>Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.</p>
<p><strong>REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.</p>
<p>Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in <em>Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2020. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020; their report follows.</p>
<p><strong>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM</strong></p>
<p>To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p><strong>Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</strong></p>
<p>We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the âCompanyâ) as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in <em>Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on the criteria established in <em>Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)</em> issued by COSO.</p>
<p>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and the related notes (collectively referred to as the âfinancial statementsâ) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>Basis for Opinion</strong></p>
<p>The Companyâs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</strong></p>
<p>A companyâs internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companyâs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companyâs assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
