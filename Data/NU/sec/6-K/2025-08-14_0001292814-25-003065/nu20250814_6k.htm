ReconciliationsThis presentation includes financial measures defined as &ldquo;non-IFRS financial measures&rdquo; by the SEC, including:
Adjusted Net Income and certain FX Neutral measures and provides reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure.
A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance or financial position
that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable
IFRS measure. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance
prepared in accordance with IFRS.Adjusted Net Income is defined as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company for
the period, adjusted for the expenses and allocated tax effects on share-based compensation.Adjusted Net Income is presented because
management believes that this non-IFRS financial measure can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public
in their review of the operating and financial performance of the Company, although it is not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any
other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. Nu also uses Adjusted
Net Income as a key profitability measure to assess the performance of the business. Nu believes Adjusted Net Income is useful to evaluate
operating and financial performance for the following reasons:Adjusted Net Income is widely used by investors and securiti analysts to
measure a company&rsquo;s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company company and from period
to period, depending on their accounting and tax methods, the book value and the market val of their assets and liabilities, and the
method by which their assets were acquired; andNon-cash equity grants made to executives, employees consultants at a certain price and
point in time, and their hedge accounting effects for the corporate tax and social wages and their income tax effects, do not necessarily
reflect how the business is performing at any particular time and the related expenses (and their subject impacts in the market value
of assets and liabilities) are not key measures of core operating performance.Adjusted Net Income is not a substitute for Net Income,
which is the IFRS measure of earnings. Additionally, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may be different from the calculation
used by other companies, including competitors in the technology and financial services industries, because other companies may not calculate
these measures in the same manner as we do, and therefore, measure may not be comparable to those of other companies.Q2&rsquo;25 Results

and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by average based on the USD/BRL
spot last price rate for all business days within the reporting in the three months ended June 30, 2025 (R$5.6625 to US$1.00), so as
to present what certain of statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained
