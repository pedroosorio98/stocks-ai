respectfully advises the Staff that, as detailed below, the Brazilian Depositary Receipts (&#147;BDRs&#148;) to be issued in the Customer Program (as defined in the Public Registration Statement) will be issued in accordance with Regulation S
(&#147;Regulation S&#148;) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) and will therefore be exempt from registration under the Securities Act. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As described in the Public Registration Statement, Brazilian customers of Nu Pagamentos S.A.&#151;Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamento
(&#147;Nu Pagamentos&#148;), a subsidiary of the Company in Brazil, who choose to participate in the Customer Program will receive sufficient funds from such subsidiary of the Company for the subscription and payment of one BDR each. The Maximum
Limit of the Customer Program (as defined in the Public Registration Statement) amounts to approximately US$32&nbsp;million worth of BDRs. Participation in the Customer Program is only available for Customers (as defined in the Public Registration
Statement), who are Brazilian residents and who have an active payment account with Nu Pagamentos. In order to have a payment account with Nu Pagamentos, each Customer must provide their &#147;<I>Cadastro de Pessoas F&iacute;sicas</I>&#148; or CPF
number (which translates from Portuguese as &#147;Natural Persons Register&#148; and is the Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification, a number attributed by the Brazilian Federal Revenue (<I>Receita Federal do Brasil</I>) to Brazilian
residents), as well as their home address, which must be in Brazil. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company believes the Customer Program forms a valid Category 1
offering under Rule 903(b)(1)(i) of Regulation S, for the following reasons: (1)&nbsp;the offer of BDRs to Customers is being made in an offshore transaction; (2)&nbsp;no directed selling efforts are being made in the United States by the Company, a
distributor, their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing; and (3)&nbsp;the Company reasonably believes at the commencement of the offering under the Customer Program that there is not substantial U.S. market
interest in the BDRs or the Company&#146;s underlying Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares. With respect to the offshore transaction requirement in item (1)&nbsp;above, it is worth noting that each offer of BDRs in the Customer Program is only being made to
Brazilian residents, and Customers are required to have a CPF number in order to participate in the Customer Program. Similarly, participating Customers are outside the United States as the Company&#146;s products and services are only available
outside the United States and the documentation relating to participating in such program is available only in the Portuguese language. Further, the Customer Program transactions will be executed outside the United States

Program are to be settled through the Company&#146;s subsidiary Nu Invest Corretora de Valores S.A. (&#147;NuInvest&#148;), a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> broker-dealer, and will be listed on the B3, the Brazilian stock exchange.
With respect to the &#147;no directed efforts&#148; requirement set forth in item (2)&nbsp;above, it is worth noting that no advertisement or publication of the Customer Program has taken place within the United States and the documentation related
to participating in such program is only available in the Portuguese language. The only publication regarding the Customer Program within the United States has been in the Public Registration Statement, within the context of required disclosure
regarding the BDRs issuable in the Brazilian offering concurrently with the registered offering of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares in the international offering, in each case as described therein. Finally, with respect to item (3)&nbsp;above, it is
worth noting that pursuant to the Commission&#146;s C&amp;DI 277.01, at the time offers were made in the Customer Program, the Company&#146;s ordinary shares were not listed or traded in the United States, and the Company was not yet a reporting
person under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Company believes the Customer Program also forms a
valid Category 1 offering under Rule 903(b)(1)(ii), as the BDRs are offered and sold in an overseas-directed offering, as they are being directed solely into Brazil to Brazilian Customers of Nu Pagamentos and the offering is being made in compliance
with the registration requirements of the Brazilian Securities Commission (the &#147;CVM&#148;) and customary practices and documentation in Brazil. In this respect, as noted above, in order for a Customer to have a payment account with Nu
Pagamentos, they must provide their CPF number and Brazilian home address, only Customers with a Brazilian CPF number and Brazilian home address may participate in the Customer Program and the documentation related to participating in such program
is available only in the Portuguese language. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the Company&#146;s belief that the Customer Program forms a valid offering
under Category 1, the Company has also complied with the requirements for a valid Category 2 offering, for the following reasons: (1)&nbsp;offering restrictions have been implemented, as NuInvest is the sole distributor of the BDRs in the Customer
Program, and has agreed in writing that all offers and sales of BDRs will only be made in accordance with Regulation S Rule 903 and 904, and the prospectus filed in Brazil to register the Customer Program with the CVM contains statements to the
effect that the BDRs received under the Customer Program have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the securities are registered under the Securities Act, or an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available; (2)&nbsp;no offers or sales are made to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person during any distribution compliance period, as the BDRs underlying
the Customer Program will be held by Nu Pagamentos for the benefit of the Customers and are subject to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-month</FONT> restricted period, during which time Customers who participate in the Customer Program may not
offer, sell, lend, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise assign or dispose their BDRs for 12 months following the closing of the Brazilian offering of BDRs; and (3)&nbsp;with NuInvest as the sole distributor of the BDRs in Brazil in the Customer
Program, no sales will be made to another distributor, dealer or person receiving a fee or commission within the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">40-day</FONT> distribution compliance period, as the BDRs underlying the Customer Program are subject
to the 12 month restricted period, during which time Nu Pagamentos, not the Customers, will hold title to the BDRs in Brazil that are part of the Customer Program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, the Company respectfully submits to the Staff that registration is not required for the BDRs that will be issued in Brazil
pursuant to the Customer Program because such BDRs will be validly offered and sold in accordance with Regulation S and will therefore be exempt from registration under the Securities Act. </P>
