88 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accor- dance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING JPMorgan Chase & Co. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making the assessment, management used the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as the “COSO” criteria. Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2006, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO criteria. Additionally, based upon manage- ment’s assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weak- nesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , JPMorgan Chase’s independent registered public accounting firm, who also audited the Firm’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, as stated in their report which is included herein. James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Cavanagh Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 21, 2007 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 89 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: We have completed integrated audits of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s consolidat- ed financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the relat- ed consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their opera- tions and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accept- ed in the United States of America. These financial statements are the respon- sibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by manage- ment, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in the accompany- ing "Management's report on internal control over financial reporting", that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company main- tained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial report- ing as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assess- ment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over finan- cial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public P RICEWATERHOUSE COOPERS LLP • 300 M ADISON AVENUE • NEW YORK, NY 10017 Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was main- tained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over finan- cial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accor- dance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of manage- ment and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements. 94 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report When the SPE does not meet the QSPE criteria, consolidation is assessed pur- suant to FIN 46R. Under FIN 46R, a VIE is defined as an entity that: (1) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; (2) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity’s operations; and/or (3) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity’s losses or the right to receive the entity’s returns. FIN 46R requires a variable interest holder (i.e., a counterparty to a VIE) to consolidate the VIE if that party will absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIE, receive the majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. This party is considered the primary beneficiary. In making this determi- nation, the Firm thoroughly evaluates the VIE’s design, capital structure and relationships among variable interest holders. When the primary beneficiary cannot be identified through a qualitative analysis, the Firm performs a quan- titative analysis, which computes and allocates expected losses or residual returns to variable interest holders. The allocation of expected cash flows in this analysis is based upon the relative contractual rights and preferences of each interest holder in the VIE’s capital structure. For further details, see Note 15 on pages 118–120 of this Annual Report. Investments in companies that are considered to be voting-interest entities under FIN 46R in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting. These investments are generally included in Other assets, and the Firm’s share of income or loss is included in Other income. All retained interests and significant transactions between the Firm, QSPEs and nonconsolidated VIEs are reflected on JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated balance sheets or in the Notes to consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of the accounting for private equity investments, see Note 4 on pages 98–99 of this Annual Report. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included in the Consolidated balance sheets. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, of revenue and expenses, and of disclosures of contin- gent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these esti- mates. For discussion of critical accounting estimates used by the Firm, see pages 83–85 of this Annual Report. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denomi- nated in foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in Other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Statements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks. Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States, with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and businesses, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segment information, see Note 33 on pages 139–141 of this Annual Report. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Certain amounts in the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The most usual condition for a controlling financial interest is the ownership of a majority of the voting interests of the entity. However, a controlling financial interest also may be deemed to exist with respect to entities, such as special purpose entities (“SPEs”), through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, providing market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. For example, they are critical to the functioning of the mortgage- and asset- backed securities and commercial paper markets. SPEs may be organized as trusts, partnerships or corporations and are typically set up for a single, discrete purpose. SPEs are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and no employees. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE. The SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issu- ing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction describe how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs can be structured to be bankruptcy-remote, thereby insulating investors from the impact of the creditors of other entities, including the seller of the assets. There are two different accounting frameworks applicable to SPEs: the quali- fying SPE (“QSPE”) framework under SFAS 140; and the variable interest entity (“VIE”) framework under FIN 46R. The applicable framework depends on the nature of the entity and the Firm’s relation to that entity. The QSPE framework is applicable when an entity transfers (sells) financial assets to an SPE meeting certain criteria defined in SFAS 140. These criteria are designed to ensure that the activities of the entity are essentially predetermined at the inception of the vehicle and that the transferor of the financial assets cannot exercise control over the entity and the assets therein. Entities meeting these criteria are not consolidated by the transferor or other counterparties, as long as they do not have the unilateral ability to liquidate or to cause the entity no longer to meet the QSPE criteria. The Firm primarily follows the QSPE model for securitizations of its residential and commercial mortgages, credit card loans and automobile loans. For further details, see Note 14 on pages 114–118 of this Annual Report. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 95 Accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments SFAS 155 applies to certain “hybrid financial instruments” which are financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives. The standard establishes a requirement to evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to determine if the interests represent freestanding derivatives or are hybrid finan- cial instruments containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation. SFAS 155 also permits an irrevocable election for fair value measurement of any hybrid financial instrument containing an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation under SFAS 133. The fair value election can be applied to existing instruments on an instrument-by-instrument basis at the date of adop- tion and can be applied to new instruments on a prospective basis. The Firm adopted SFAS 155 effective January 1, 2006. The Firm has elected to fair value all instruments issued, acquired or modified after December 31, 2005, that are required to be bifurcated under SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 138, SFAS 149 and SFAS 155. In addition, the Firm elected to fair value certain structured notes existing as of December 31, 2005, resulting in a $22 million cumulative effect increase to Retained earnings. The cumulative effect adjustment includes gross unrealized gains of $29 million and gross unrealized losses of $7 million. The substantial majority of the structured notes to which the fair-value election has been applied are classified in Long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Bank One was converted in a stock-for-stock exchange into 1.32 shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase stockholders kept their shares, which remained outstanding and unchanged as shares of JPMorgan Chase following the Merger. Key objectives of the Merger were to provide the Firm with a more balanced business mix and greater geographic diversification. The Merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of Bank One be fair valued as of July 1, 2004. The purchase price to complete the Merger was $58.5 billion. As part of the Merger, certain accounting policies and practices were conformed, which resulted in $976 million of charges in 2004. The significant components of the conformity charges were a $1.4 billion charge related to the decertifica- tion of the seller’s interest in credit card securitizations, and the benefit of a $584 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses as a result of conforming the wholesale and consumer credit provision methodologies. 96 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report The final purchase price of the Merger was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their fair values as of the Merger date. The com- putation of the purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets of Bank One – based upon their respective fair values as of July 1, 2004 – and the resulting goodwill are presented below.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 98 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 4 – Principal transactions Principal transactions is a new caption, effective January 1, 2006, in the Consolidated statements of income. Principal transactions revenue consists of: realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities (including physical commodities inventories that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value); changes in fair value associated with structured notes to which the SFAS 155 fair value election has been applied, and Private equity gains and losses. The prior-period presentation of Trading revenue and Private equity gains (losses) has been reclassified to this new caption.

The Firm is obligated to purchase securities at a future date to cover the short positions. Included in Trading assets and Trading liabil- ities are the reported receivables (unrealized gains) and payables (unrealized losses) related to derivatives. Loans are classified as trading where positions are bought and sold to make profits from short-term movements in price. Trading positions are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the fair value of Trading assets and Trading liabilities for the dates indicated: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Trading assets Debt and equity instruments: U.S. government and federal agency obligations $ 17,358 $ 16,283 U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations 28,544 24,172 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 9,569 9,887 Certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances and commercial paper 8,204 5,652 Debt securities issued by non-U.S. governments 58,387 48,671 Corporate securities and other 188,075 143,925 Total debt and equity instruments 310,137 248,590 Derivative receivables: (a)(b) Interest rate 28,932 28,113 Foreign exchange 4,260 2,855 Equity 6,246 5,575 Credit derivatives 5,732 3,464 Commodity 10,431 9,780 Total derivative receivables 55,601 49,787 Total trading assets $ 365,738 $ 298,377 December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Trading liabilities Debt and equity instruments (c) $ 90,488 $ 94,157 Derivative payables: (a)(b) Interest rate 22,738 26,930 Foreign exchange 4,820 3,453 Equity 16,579 11,539 Credit derivatives 6,003 2,445 Commodity 7,329 7,406 Total derivative payables 57,469 51,773 Total trading liabilities $ 147,957 $ 145,930 (a) 2005 has been adjusted to reflect more appropriate product classifications of certain bal- ances.

Private equity The following table presents the carrying value and cost of the Private equity investment portfolio for the dates indicated: December 31, 2006 2005 (in millions) Carrying value Cost Carrying value Cost Total private equity investments $ 6,359 $ 7,560 $ 6,374 $ 8,036 Private equity investments are held primarily by the Private equity business within Corporate (which includes investments made by JPMorgan Partners and ONE Equity Partners). The Private Equity business invests in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines. Accordingly, these investments, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interest held by Private equity, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in value are reported in Principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated statements of income in the period that the gains or losses occur. Privately held investments are initially valued based upon cost. The carrying val- ues of privately held investments are adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced by financing events with third-party capital providers. In addition, these investments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by Private equity senior investment professionals. A variety of factors are reviewed and monitored to assess impairment including, but not limited to, operating performance of, and future expectations regarding, the particular port- folio investment; industry valuations of comparable public companies; changes in market outlook; and the third-party financing environment over time. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 99 Private equity also holds publicly held equity investments, generally obtained through the initial public offering of privately held equity investments. Publicly held investments are marked-to-market at the quoted public value. To deter- mine the carrying values of these investments, Private equity incorporates the use of discounts to take into account the fact that it cannot immediately real- ize the quoted public values as a result of regulatory and/or contractual sales restrictions imposed on these holdings. Note 5 – Other noninterest revenue Investment banking fees This revenue category includes advisory and equity and debt underwriting fees. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue when the related services have been per- formed. Underwriting fees are recognized as revenue when the Firm has rendered all services to the issuer and is entitled to collect the fee from the issuer, as long as there are no other contingencies associated with the fee (e.g., the fee is not contingent upon the customer obtaining financing). Underwriting fees are net of syndicate expenses. The Firm recognizes credit arrangement and syndication fees as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. The following table presents the components of Investment banking fees: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (a) Underwriting: Equity $ 1,179 $ 864 $ 780 Debt 2,703 1,969 1,858 Total Underwriting 3,882 2,833 2,638 Advisory 1,638 1,255 898 Total $ 5,520 $ 4,088 $ 3,536 (a) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. Lending & deposit related fees This revenue category includes fees from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, deposit-related fees in lieu of compensating bal- ances, cash management-related activities or transactions, deposit accounts, and other loan servicing activities. These fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Asset management, administration and commissions This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services, insurance premiums and commissions and other products. These fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Performance-based fees, which are earned based upon exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets, are accrued and recognized at the end of the performance period in which the target is met. Mortgage fees and related income This revenue category includes fees and income derived from mortgage origina- tion, sales and servicing, and includes the effect of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline, warehouse and the mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset (excluding gains and losses on the sale of Available-for- sale (“AFS”) securities). Origination fees and gains or losses on loan sales are r ecognized in income upon sale. Mortgage servicing fees are recognized over the period the related service is provided. Valuation changes in the mortgage pipeline, warehouse, MSR asset and corresponding risk management instruments are recognized in earnings as these changes occur. Net interest income and secu- rities gains and losses on AFS securities used in mortgage-related risk manage- ment activities are not included in Mortgage fees and related income. For a fur- ther discussion of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 121–122 of this Annual Report. Credit card income This revenue category includes interchange income from credit and debit cards and servicing fees earned in connection with securitization activities. Volume- related payments to partners and expenses for rewards programs are netted against interchange income. Expenses related to rewards programs are recorded when the rewards are earned by the customer. Other Fee revenues are recog- nized as earned, except for annual fees, which are deferred with direct loan origination costs and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 12-month period to which they pertain. Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous affinity organizations and co-brand partners, which grant to the Firm exclusive rights to market to their members or customers. These organizations and partners endorse the credit card programs and provide their mailing lists to the Firm, and they may also conduct marketing activities and provide awards under the various credit card programs. The terms of these agreements generally range from 3 to 10 years. The economic incentives the Firm pays to the endorsing organizations and partners typically include payments based upon new account originations, charge volumes, and the cost of the endorsing organizations’ or partners’ marketing activities and awards. The Firm recognizes the payments made to the affinity organizations and co- brand partners based upon new account originations as direct loan origination costs. Payments based upon charge volumes are considered by the Firm as rev- enue sharing with the affinity organizations and co-brand partners, which are deducted from Credit card income as the related revenue is earned. Payments based upon marketing efforts undertaken by the endorsing organization or partner are expensed by the Firm as incurred. These costs are recorded within Noninterest expense.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 100 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 7 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans The Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 88, and its other postretirement employee benefit (“OPEB”) plans are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 106. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, which requires companies to recognize on their Consolidated balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of their defined benefit postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. SFAS 158 requires unrecog- nized amounts (e.g., net actuarial loss and prior service costs) to be recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and that these amounts be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost based upon the current amortization and recognition requirements of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106. The Firm prospectively adopted SFAS 158 as required on December 31, 2006, which resulted in a charge to AOCI of $1.1 billion. SFAS 158 also eliminates the provisions of SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 that allow plan assets and obligations to be measured as of a date not more than three months prior to the reporting entity’s balance sheet date. The Firm uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans; therefore, this provision of SFAS 158 will have no effect on the Firm’s financial statements. For the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. For the Firm’s OPEB plans, a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period is used to deter- mine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net actuarial gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net actuarial gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess, as well as prior service costs, are amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently 10 years. For OPEB plans, any excess net actu- arial gains and losses also are amortized over the average future service peri- od, which is currently seven years; however, prior service costs are amortized over the average years of service remaining to full eligibility age, which is cur- rently five years. Defined benefit pension plans The Firm has a qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. The U.S. plan employs a cash balance formula, in the form of pay and interest credits, to determine the benefits to be provided at retirement, based upon eligible com- pensation and years of service. Employees begin to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of service, and benefits generally vest after five years of service. The Firm also offers benefits through defined benefit pension plans to qualifying employees in certain non-U.S. locations based upon factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It is the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable employee benefit and local tax laws. As a result of the enactment of the Pension Protection Act in August 2006, which increased the maximum amount allowable for tax deduction, the Firm is reviewing 2007 U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan contribution alternatives. The amount of potential 2007 contributions, if any, is not reason- ably estimable at this time. JPMorgan Chase has a number of other defined benefit pension plans (i.e., U.S. plans not subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act). The most significant of these plans is the Excess Retirement Plan, pursuant to which certain employees earn pay and interest credits on compensation amounts above the maximum stipulated by law under a qualified plan. The Excess Retirement Plan is a nonqualified, noncontributory U.S. pension plan with an unfunded projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2006 and 2005, in the amount of $301 million and $273 million, respectively. In the current year, this plan has been incorporated into certain of this Note’s tables for which it had not been included in prior years. Defined contribution plans JPMorgan Chase offers several defined contribution plans in the U.S. and in certain non-U.S. locations, all of which are administered in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The most significant of these plans is The JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (the “401(k) Savings Plan”), which cov- ers substantially all U.S. employees. The 401(k) Savings Plan allows employees to make pretax contributions to tax-deferred investment portfolios. The JPMorgan Chase Common Stock Fund, which is an investment option under the 401(k) Savings Plan, is a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan. The Firm matches eligible employee contributions up to a certain percentage of benefits-eligible compensation per pay period, subject to plan and legal limits. Employees begin to receive matching contributions after completing a one-year service requirement and are immediately vested in the Firm’s contributions when made. Employees with total annual cash compensation of $250,000 or more are not eligible for matching contributions. The 401(k) Savings Plan also permits discretionary profit-sharing contributions by participating companies for certain employees, subject to a specified vesting schedule. OPEB plans JPMorgan Chase offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and qualifying U.S. employees. These benefits vary with length of service and date of hire and provide for limits on the Firm’s share of cov- ered medical benefits. The medical benefits are contributory, while the life insurance benefits are noncontributory. As of August 1, 2005, the eligibility requirements for U.S. employees to qualify for subsidized retiree medical cov- erage were revised, and life insurance coverage was eliminated for active employees retiring after 2005. Postretirement medical benefits also are offered to qualifying U.K. employees. JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. OPEB obligation is funded with corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, COLI proceeds (death benefits, with- drawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expenses. The U.K. OPEB plan is unfunded. The following tables present the funded status, changes in the benefit obliga- tions and plan assets, accumulated benefit obligations, and AOCI amounts reported on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans: JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 101 Defined benefit pension plans As of or for the year ended December 31, U.S. Non-U.S. OPEB plans(g) (in millions) 2006 2005(e) 2006 2005 2006 2005(h) Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ (8,054) $ (7,980) $ (2,378) $ (1,969) $ (1,395) $ (1,577) Cazenove business partnership — — — (291) — — Benefits earned during the year (281) (293) (37) (25) (9) (13) Interest cost on benefit obligations (452) (453) (120) (104) (78) (81) Plan amendments — — 2 — — 117 Liabilities of newly material plans (a) — — (154) — — — Employee contributions NA NA (2) — (50) (44) Actuarial gain (loss) (200) (123) (23) (310) (55) 21 Benefits paid 856 766 68 66 177 187 Expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts NA NA NA NA (13) NA Curtailments 33 29 2 — (12) (9) Settlements — — 37 —— — Special termination benefits — — (1) — (2) (1) Foreign exchange impact and other — — (311) 255 (6) 5 Benefit obligation, end of year $ (8,098) $ (8,054) $ (2,917) $ (2,378) $ (1,443) $ (1,395) Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year $ 9,617 $ 9,637 $ 2,223 $ 1,889 $ 1,329 $ 1,302 Cazenove business partnership — — — 252 — — Actual return on plan assets 1,151 703 94 308 120 43 Firm contributions 43 43 241 78 2 3 Employee contributions — — 2 — — — Assets of newly material plans (a) — — 67 — — — Benefits paid (856) (766) (68) (66) (100) (19) Settlements — — (37) — — — Foreign exchange impact and other — — 291 (238) — — Fair value of plan assets, end of year $ 9,955 (c) $ 9,617 (c) $ 2,813 $ 2,223 $ 1,351 $ 1,329 Funded (unfunded) status $ 1,857 $ 1,563 $ (104) $ (155) $ (92) $ (66) Unrecognized amounts: Net actuarial loss NA(d) 1,087 NA(d) 599 NA(d) 335 Prior service cost (credit) NA(d) 43 NA(d) 3 NA(d) (105) Net amount recognized in the Consolidated balance sheets (b) $ 1,857 $ 2,693 $ (104) $ 447 (f) $ (92) $ 164 Accumulated benefit obligation, end of year $ (7,679) $ (7,647) $ (2,849) $ (2,303) NA NA (a) Reflects adjustments related to pension plans in Germany and Switzerland, which have defined benefit pension obligations that were not previously measured under SFAS 87 due to immateriality.

(h) The U.S. OPEB plan was remeasured as of August 1, 2005, to reflect a midyear plan amendment and the final Medicare Part D regul ations that were issued on January 21, 2005; as a result, the ben- efit obligation was reduced by $116 million.

Other factors that contribute to this net actu- arial loss include demographic experience, which differs from expectations, and changes in other actuarial assumptions. For OPEB plans, the primary drivers of the cumulative actuarial loss were the decline in the discount rate in recent years and in the medical cost trend rate, which was higher than expected. These losses hav e been offset partially by the recognition of future savings attributable to Medicare Part D subsidy receipts.

(c) Effective July 1, 2004, the Firm assumed the obligations of heritage Bank One's pension and OPEB plans. These plans were similar to those of heritage JPMorgan Chase. The heritage Bank One plans were merged into the JPMorgan Chase plans effective December 31, 2004. (d) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of the heritage JPMorgan Chase results. (e) The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 resulted in a reduction of $32 million, $15 million and $5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in net periodic benefit cost. The impact on 2006 and 2005 costs were higher as a result of the final Medicare Part D regulations issued on January 21, 2005, which were reflected beginning as of August 1, 2005, the next measurement date for the plan.

Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking building-block approach and are not strictly based upon historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long- term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of infla- tion, real bond yield and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expect- ed effect on returns from changing yields. Other asset-class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. For the U.K. defined benefit pension plan, which represents the most signifi- cant of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, procedures similar to those in the U.S. are used to develop the expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit pension plan assets, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on U.K. plan assets is an average of projected long-term returns for each asset class, selected by reference to the yield on long-term U.K. gov- ernment bonds and AA-rated long-term corporate bonds, plus an equity risk premium above the risk-free rate. In 2006 and 2005, the discount rate used in determining the benefit obliga- tion under the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans was selected by reference to the yield on a portfolio of bonds with redemption dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows; such portfolio is derived from a broad-based universe of high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. In years in which this hypothetical bond portfolio generates excess cash, such excess is assumed to be reinvested at the one-year forward rates implied by the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve published as of the measurement date. Prior to 2005, discount rates were selected by reference to the year-end Moody’s corporate AA rate, as well as other high-quality indices with a duration that was similar to that of the respective plan's benefit obligations. The discount rates for the U.K. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans represent rates from the yield curve of the year-end iBoxx £ corporate AA 15-year-plus bond index with durations corre- sponding to those of the underlying benefit obligations. The following tables present the weighted-average annualized actuarial assumptions for the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the components of net periodic benefit costs for the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, as of and for the periods indicated: U.S. Non-U.S. Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs Discount rate: Defined benefit pension plans 5.70% 5.75% 6.00% 2.00-4.70% 2.00-5.30% 2.00-5.75% OPEB plans 5.65 5.25-5.75 (a) 6.00 4.70 5.30 5.40 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: Defined benefit pension plans 7.50 7.50 7.50-7.75 3.25-5.50 3.25-5.75 3.00-6.50 OPEB plans 6.84 6.80(b) 4.75-7.00 NA NA NA Rate of compensation increase 4.00 4.00 4.25-4.50 3.00-3.75 1.75-3.75 1.75-3.75 Health care cost trend rate: Assumed for next year 10.00 10.00 10.00 7.50 7.50 6.50 Ultimate 5.00 5.00 5.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 Year when rate will reach ultimate 2013 2012 2011 2010 2010 2009 (a) The OPEB plan was remeasured as of August 1, 2005, and a rate of 5.25% was used from the period of August 1, 2005, through Decem ber 31, 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 104 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report The following table presents the effect of a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on JPMorgan Chase’s total service and interest cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation: For the year ended December 31, 2006 1-Percentage- 1-Percentage- (in millions) point increase point decrease Effect on total service and interest costs $ 4 $ (3) Effect on postretirement obligation 63 (54) At December 31, 2006, the Firm increased the discount rates used to deter- mine its benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans based upon current market interest rates, which will result in a decrease in expense of approximately $23 million for 2007. The 2007 expected long- term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets remained at 7.50%. The 2007 expected long-term rate of return on the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan assets increased from 6.84% to 7.00%. The Firm maintained the health care benefit obligation trend assumption at 10% for 2007, declining to an ultimate rate of 5% in 2014. The interest crediting rate assumption at December 31, 2006, used to determine pension benefits changed primarily due to changes in mar- ket interest rates, which will result in additional expense of $10 million for 2007. The assumed rate of compensation increase remained at 4.00% as of December 31, 2006. The most significant change to the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs in 2006 from the prior year were lower discount rates for the Firm’s non-U.S. plans, both defined benefit pension and OPEB, due to lower market interest rates, resulting in $23 million higher com- pensation expense in 2006 compared with 2005. JPMorgan Chase’s U.S.defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expenses are most sensitive to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. With all other assumptions held constant, a 25–basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $27 million in 2007 U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expenses. A 25–basis point decline in the discount rate for the U.S. plans would result in an increase in 2007 U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expenses of approximately $3 million and an increase in the related projected benefit obligations of approximately $217 million. A 25 –basis point decline in the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans would result in an increase in the 2007 non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expenses of approxi- mately $19 million. A 25–basis point increase in the interest crediting rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan would result in an increase in 2007 U.S. defined benefit pension expense of approximately $10 million and an increase in the related projected benefit obligations of approximately $82 million. Investment strategy and asset allocation The investment policy for the Firm’s postretirement employee benefit plan assets is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respec- tive plan's needs and goals, using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. Specifically, the goal is to optimize the asset mix for future benefit obligations, while manag- ing various risk factors and each plan’s investment return objectives. For example, long-duration fixed income securities are included in the U.S. quali- fied pension plan’s asset allocation, in recognition of its long-duration obliga- tions. Plan assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers and are rebalanced to within approved ranges, to the extent economically practical. The Firm’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets are held in various trusts and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio of equities (including U.S. large and small capitalization and international equities), fixed income (including corporate and government bonds), Treasury inflation-indexed and high-yield securities, real estate, cash equivalents, and alternative investments. Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets are held in various trusts and are similarly invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securi- ties. Assets of the Firm’s COLI policies, which are used to fund partially the U.S. OPEB plan, are held in separate accounts with an insurance company and are invested in equity and fixed income index funds. In addition, tax- exempt municipal debt securities, held in a trust, were used to fund the U.S. OPEB plan in prior periods; as of December 31, 2006, there are no remaining assets in the trust. As of December 31, 2006, the assets used to fund the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include JPMorgan Chase common stock, except in connection with invest- ments in third-party stock-index funds. The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation at December 31 for the years indicated, and the respective ap proved range/target allocation by asset category, for the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans: Defined benefit pension plans U.S. Non-U.S. (a) OPEB plans (b) Target % of plan assets Target % of plan assets Target % of plan assets December 31, Allocation 2006 2005 Allocation 2006 2005 Allocation 2006 2005 Asset category Debt securities 10-30% 31% 33% 73% 70% 75% 50% 50% 54% Equity securities 25-60 55 57 26 26 24 50 50 46 Real estate 5-20 8 6— 1 1— — — Alternatives 15-50 6 41 3 —— — — Total 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% (a) Represents the U.K. defined benefit pension plan only, as plans outside the U.K. are not significant.

Employee stock-based awards The Firm has granted restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock options, and stock-settled SARs to certain of its employees. In 2006, JPMorgan Chase granted long-term stock-based awards under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). In 2005, JPMorgan Chase granted long-term stock-based awards under the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan as amended (the “1996 plan”) until May 2005 and under the 2005 Plan thereafter to certain key employees. These two plans, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, constitute the Firm’s stock-based compensation plans (“LTI Plans”). The 2005 Plan became effective on May 17, 2005, after approval by shareholders at the 2005 annual meeting. The 2005 Plan replaced three existing stock-based compensation plans – the 1996 Plan and two nonshareholder-approved plans – all of which expired in May 2005. Under the terms of the 2005 Plan, 275 million shares of common stock are available for issuance during its five-year term. The 2005 Plan is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting stock-based incentive awards. Restricted stock and RSUs are granted by JPMorgan Chase at no cost to the recipient. These awards are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed, including continued employment for a specified period. The recipient of a share of restricted stock is entitled to voting rights and dividends on the common stock. An RSU entitles the recipient to receive a share of common stock after the applicable restrictions lapse; the recipient is entitled to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the peri- od the RSU is outstanding. Effective January 2005, the equity portion of the Firm’s annual incentive awards were granted primarily in the form of RSUs. The Firm also periodically grants discretionary share-based payment awards, primarily in the form of both employee stock options and SARs. Under the LTI Plans, stock options and SARs have been granted with an exer- cise price equal to JPMorgan Chase’s common stock price on the grant date. Generally, options and SARs cannot be exercised until at least one year after the grant date and become exercisable over various periods as determined at the time of the grant. These awards generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The Firm’s share-based compensation awards generally vest in multiple tranches.

SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including employee stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) , to be measured at their grant date fair values. Results for prior periods have not been restated. The Firm also adopted the transition election provided by FSP FAS 123(R)-3. JPMorgan Chase had previously adopted SFAS 123, effective January 1, 2003, using the prospective transition method. Under SFAS 123, the Firm accounted for its stock-based compensation awards at fair value, similar to the SFAS 123R requirements. However, under the prospective transition method, JPMorgan Chase continued to account for unmodified stock options that were outstanding as of December 31, 2002, using the APB 25 intrinsic value method. Under this method, no expense was recognized for stock options granted at an exercise price equal to the stock price on the grant date, since such options have no intrinsic value. Upon adopting SFAS 123R, the Firm began to recognize in the Consolidated statements of income compensation expense for unvested stock options previ- ously accounted for under APB 25. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase recognized as compensation expense an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment resulting from the SFAS 123R requirement to estimate forfeitures at the grant date instead of recognizing them as incurred. Finally, the Firm revised its accounting policies for share-based payments granted to retirement-eligible employees under SFAS 123R. Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the Firm’s accounting policy for share-based payment awards granted to retirement-eligible employees was to recognize compensation cost over the award’s stated service period. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees in 2006, JPMorgan Chase recognized compensation expense on the grant date without giving considera- tion to the impact of post employment restrictions. In the first quarter of 2006, the Firm also began to accrue the estimated cost of stock awards granted to retirement-eligible employees in January 2007. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 106 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Employee stock option and SARs activity Compensation expense, which is measured at the grant date as the fair value of employee stock options and SARs, is recognized in Net income as described above. The fol- lowing table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s employee stock option and SARs activity for the year ended December 31, 2006, including awards granted to key employees and awards granted in prior years under broad-based plans: Year ended December 31, 2006 (in thousands, except Number of Weighted-average Weighted-average Aggregate weighted-average data) options/SARs exercise price remaining contractual life (in years) intrinsic value Outstanding, January 1 444,157 $ 38.61 Granted 15,229 45.85 Exercised (70,446) 29.93 Forfeited (3,365) 36.14 Canceled (9,348) 47.88 Outstanding, December 31 376,227 $ 40.31 4.3 $ 3,384,553 Exercisable, December 31 317,174 40.63 3.8 2,794,461 The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. For each tranche granted (other than grants to employees who are retirement eligible at the grant date), compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become retirement eligible during the vesting peri- od. For each tranche granted to employees who will become retirement eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight- line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee's retirement eli- gibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based payment awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2006, the Firm issued new shares of common stock from January 1 through May 31, 2006, and treasury shares from June 1 through December 31, 2006. On March 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase pro- gram that authorizes the repurchase of up to $8 billion of the Firm’s common shares, which supersedes a $6 billion stock repurchase program approved in 2004. The $8 billion authorization includes shares to be repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s employee stock-based plans. The actual number of shares repurchased is subject to various factors, including: market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative potential investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transac- tions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. In December 2005, the Firm accelerated the vesting of approximately 41 mil- lion unvested, out-of-the-money employee stock options granted in 2001 under the Growth and Performance Incentive Program (“GPIP”), which were scheduled to vest in January 2007. These options were not modified other than to accelerate vesting. The related expense was approximately $145 mil- lion, and was recognized as compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Firm believed that at the time the options were accelerated they had limited economic value since the exercise price of the accelerated options was $51.22 and the closing price of the Firm’s common stock on the effective date of the acceleration was $39.69. Restricted stock and RSU activity Compensation expense for restricted stock and RSUs is measured based upon the number of shares granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and is recognized in Net income as previously described. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s restricted stock and RSU activity for 2006: Restricted stock and RSU activity Year ended December 31, 2006 (in thousands, except weighted Number of Weighted-average average data) Shares grant date fair value Outstanding, January 1 84,604 $ 35.22 Granted 44,553 39.43 Lapsed (a) (33,327) 31.00 Forfeited (7,374) 40.28 Restricted stock/RSUs outstanding December 31 88,456 $ 38.50 (a) Lapsed awards represent awards granted in prior years for which, in the case of restricted stock, restrictions have lapsed; and, in the case of RSUs, the awards have been converted into common stock. The total fair value of shares that vested during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The vesting of certain restricted stock and RSU awards issued prior to 2002 was conditioned upon certain service requirements being met and JPMorgan Chase’s common stock reaching and sustaining target prices within a five- year performance period. During 2002, it was determined that it was no longer probable that the target stock prices related to forfeitable awards granted in 1999, 2000, and 2001 would be achieved within their respective performance periods, and accordingly, previously accrued expenses were reversed. The target stock prices for these awards ranged from $73.33 to $85.00. These awards were forfeited as follows: 1.2 million shares granted in 1999 were forfeited in January 2004; 1.2 million shares granted in 2000 were forfeited in January 2005; and 1.2 million shares granted in 2001 were forfeited in January 2006. The weighted-average grant date per share fair value of stock options and SARs granted during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $10.99, $10.44 and $13.77, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $994 million, $364 million and $520 million, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 107 Impact of adoption of SFAS 123R During 2006, the incremental expense related to the Firm’s adoption of SFAS 123R was $712 million. This amount represents an accelerated noncash recog- nition of costs that would otherwise have been incurred in future periods. Also as a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the Firm’s Income from continuing opera- tions (pretax) for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower by $712 mil- lion, and Income from continuing operations (after-tax), as well as Net income, for the year ended December 31, 2006, was lower by $442 million, than if the Firm had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25 and SFAS 123. Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing opera- tions, as well as basic and diluted Net income per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.13 and $0.12 lower, respectively, than if the Firm had not adopted SFAS 123R. The Firm recognized noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive awards of $2.4 billion (including the $712 mil- lion incremental impact of adopting SFAS 123R), $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in its Consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2006, approximately $1.0 billion (pretax) of compensation cost related to unvested awards has not yet been charged to Net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into com- pensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards to employees. Cash flows and tax benefits The total income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation arrange- ments recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $947 million, $625 million and $519 million, respectively. Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the Firm presented all tax benefits of deduc- tions resulting from share-based compensation awards as operating cash flows in its Consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS 123R requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those share-based compensation awards (i.e., excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. The $302 million of excess tax benefits classified as a financing cash inflow dur- ing 2006 would have been classified as an operating cash inflow if the Firm had not adopted SFAS 123R. The following table sets forth the cash received from the exercise of stock options under all share-based compensation arrangements and the actual tax benefit realized related to the tax deduction from the exercise of stock options.

The following table presents the assumptions used to value employee stock options and SARs granted during the period under the Black-Scholes valuation model: Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Weighted-average annualized valuation assumptions Risk-free interest rate 5.11% 4.25% 3.44% Expected dividend yield 2.89 3.79 3.59 Expected common stock price volatility 23 37 41 Expected life (in years) 6.8 6.8 6.7 Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Firm used the historical volatility of its common stock price as the expected volatility assumption in valuing options. The Firm completed a review of its expected volatility assumption in 2006. Effective October 1, 2006, JPMorgan Chase began to value its employee stock options granted or modified after that date using an expected volatility assump- tion derived from the implied volatility of its publicly traded stock options. The expected life assumption is an estimate of the length of time that an employee might hold an option or SAR before it is exercised or cancelled. The expected life assumption was developed using historic experience. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 108 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 10 – Securities Securities are classified as AFS, Held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or Trading. Trading securities are discussed in Note 4 on page 98 of this Annual Report. Securities are classified primarily as AFS when purchased as part of the Firm’s manage- ment of its structural interest rate risk. AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses after SFAS 133 valuation adjustments are reported as net increases or decreases to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in Securities gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. Securities that the Firm has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM and are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm has not classified new purchases of securities as HTM for the past several years. The following table presents realized gains and losses from AFS securities: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (b) Realized gains $ 399 $ 302 $ 576 Realized losses (942) (1,638) (238) Net realized Securities gains (losses)(a) $ (543) $(1,336) $ 338 (a) Proceeds from securities sold were generally within 2% of amortized cost.

Factors considered include the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer of a security; and the Firm’s intent and ability to retain the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. If, based upon an analysis of each of the above factors, it is determined that the impairment is other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the security is written down to fair value, and a loss is recognized through earnings. Included in the $546 million of gross unrealized losses on AFS securities at December 31, 2006, was $242 million of unrealized losses that have existed for a period greater than 12 months. These securities are predominately rated AAA and the unrealized losses primarily are due to overall increases in market inter- est rates and not concerns regarding the underlying credit of the issuers. The majority of the securities with unrealized losses aged greater than 12 months are obligations of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and have a fair value at December 31, 2006, that is within 3% of their amortized cost basis.

The estimated duration, which reflects antici- pated future prepayments based upon a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately four years for MBSs and CMOs. (b) The average yield is based upon amortized cost balances at year end. Yields are derived by dividing interest income by total amortized cost. Taxable-equivalent yields are used where applicable. Note 11 – Securities financing activities JPMorgan Chase enters into resale agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions, primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions and settle other securities obligations. The Firm also enters into these transactions to accommodate customers’ needs. Securities purchased under resale agreements (“resale agreements”) and securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase agreements”) are generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at the amounts the securities will be subse- quently sold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Where appropriate, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis in accordance with FIN 41. JPMorgan Chase takes possession of securities purchased under resale agreements. On a daily basis,JPMorgan Chase monitors the market value of the underlying collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. gov- ernment and agency securities that it has received from its counterparties, and requests additional collateral when necessary. Transactions similar to financing activities that do not meet the SFAS 140 definition of a repurchase agreement are accounted for as “buys” and “sells” rather than financing transactions. These transactions are accounted for as a purchase (sale) of the underlying securities with a forward obligation to sell (purchase) the securities. The forward purchase (sale) obligation, a derivative, is recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at its fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Principal transactions revenue. Securities borrowed and securities lent are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowed consist primarily of government and equity securities. JPMorgan Chase monitors the market value of the securities borrowed and lent on a daily basis and calls for additional collateral when appropriate. Fees received or paid are recorded in Interest income or Interest expense. December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 122,479 $ 129,570 Securities borrowed 73,688 74,604 Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 143,253 $ 103,052 Securities loaned 8,637 14,072 JPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the secured party are identified as financial instru- ments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2006, the Firm had received securities as collateral that could be repledged, delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of approxi- mately $317 billion. This collateral was generally obtained under resale or securities-borrowing agreements. Of these securities, approximately $291 bil- lion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 112 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 12 – Loans Loans that are originated or purchased by the Firm and that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of the Allowance for loan losses, unearned income and any net deferred loan fees. Loans that are either originated or pur- chased by the Firm and that management intends to sell or to securitize are classified as held-for-sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in Noninterest revenue. Gains or losses on held-for-sale loans are also recorded in Noninterest revenue. Interest income is recognized using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan. Loans are transferred from the retained portfolio to the held-for-sale portfolio when management decides to sell the loan. Transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer; losses attrib- uted to credit losses are charged off to the Allowance for loan losses and losses due to interest rates, or exchange rates, are recognized in Noninterest revenue. Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued. Loans (other than certain consumer loans discussed below) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if, in the opinion of management, full payment of principal or interest is in doubt, or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral, if any, is insufficient to cover principal and inter- est. Interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonac- crual status is reversed against Interest income. In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of loan principal, all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans. Loans are restored to accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans are charged off to the Allowance for loan losses when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. Consumer loans are generally charged to the Allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency, in accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) policy. For example, credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification of the filing of bankruptcy, whichever is earlier. Residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Other consumer products, if collateralized, are generally charged off to net realizable value at 120 days past due. Accrued interest on residential mortgage prod- ucts, automobile financings, education financings and certain other consumer loans are accounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual loan policy discussed in the preceding paragraph. Interest and fees related to credit card loans con- tinue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. Accrued interest on all other consumer loans is generally reversed against Interest income when the loan is charged off. A collateralized loan is considered an in-sub- stance foreclosure and is reclassified to assets acquired in loan satisfactions, within Other assets, only when JPMorgan Chase has taken physical possession of the collateral, regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have taken place. The composition of the loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was as follows: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 U.S. wholesale loans: Commercial and industrial $ 77,788 $ 70,233 Real estate 14,237 13,612 Financial institutions 14,103 11,100 Lease financing receivables 2,608 2,621 Other 9,950 14,499 Total U.S. wholesale loans 118,686 112,065 Non-U.S. wholesale loans: Commercial and industrial 43,428 27,452 Real estate 1,146 1,475 Financial institutions 19,163 7,975 Lease financing receivables 1,174 1,144 Other 145 — Total non-U.S. wholesale loans 65,056 38,046 Total wholesale loans: (a) Commercial and industrial 121,216 97,685 Real estate (b) 15,383 15,087 Financial institutions 33,266 19,075 Lease financing receivables 3,782 3,765 Other 10,095 14,499 Total wholesale loans 183,742 150,111 Total consumer loans: (c) Home equity 85,730 73,866 Mortgage 59,668 58,959 Auto loans and leases 41,009 46,081 All other loans 27,097 18,393 Credit card receivables (d) 85,881 71,738 Total consumer loans 299,385 269,037 Total loans (e)(f) $ 483,127 $ 419,148 (a) Includes Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 113 Impaired loans JPMorgan Chase accounts for and discloses nonaccrual loans as impaired loans and recognizes their interest income as discussed previously for nonaccrual loans. The following are excluded from impaired loans: small-balance, homo- geneous consumer loans; loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value; debt securities; and leases. The table below sets forth information about JPMorgan Chase’s impaired loans. The Firm primarily uses the discounted cash flow method for valuing impaired loans: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Impaired loans with an allowance $ 623 $ 1,095 Impaired loans without an allowance (a) 66 80 Total impaired loans $ 689 $ 1,175 Allowance for impaired loans under SFAS 114 (b) 153 257 (a) When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the carrying value of the loan, then the loan does not require an allowance under SFAS 114. (b) The allowance for impaired loans under SFAS 114 is included in JPMorgan Chase’s Allowance for loan losses. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Average balance of impaired loans during the year $ 990 $ 1,478 $ 1,883 Interest income recognized on impaired loans during the year 2 58 Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s Allowance for loan losses covers the wholesale (risk-rated) and consumer (scored) loan portfolios and represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Management also computes an allowance for wholesale lending-related commitments using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loans. The table below summarizes the Firm’s reporting of its allowance for credit losses: Reported in: Allowance for credit losses on: Balance sheet Income statement Loans Allowance for loan losses Provision for credit losses Lending-related commitments Other liabilities Provision for credit losses The Allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component. Within the formula-based component is a statistical calculation and an adjustment to the statistical calculation. The asset-specific component relates to provisions for losses on loans considered impaired and measured pursuant to SFAS 114. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. To compute the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually, and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The formula-based component covers performing wholesale and consumer loans and is the product of a statistical calculation, as well as adjustments to such calculation. These adjustments take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation. The statistical calculation is the product of probability of default and loss given default. For risk-rated loans (generally loans originated by the wholesale lines of business), these factors are differentiated by risk rating and maturity. For scored loans (generally loans originated by the consumer lines of business), loss is pri- marily determined by applying statistical loss factors and other risk indicators to pools of loans by asset type. Adjustments to the statistical calculation for the risk-rated portfolios are determined by creating estimated ranges using histori- cal experience of both probability of default and loss given default. Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries are also incorporated into the calculation where relevant. Adjustments to the statistical calculation for the scored loan portfolios are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. The estimated ranges and the determination of the appropriate point within the range are based upon man- agement’s view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and polit- ical conditions, quality of underwriting standards, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. The Allowance for lending-related commitments represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s process of extending credit as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Management establishes an asset-specific allowance for lending-relatedcommitments that are considered impaired and computes a formula-based allowance for performing wholesale lending-related commitments. These are computed using a methodology simi- lar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio, modified for expected matu- rities and probabilities of drawdown. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Controller of the Firm, and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of December 31, 2006, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that are inher- ent in the portfolio, including those not yet identifiable).

Note 14 – Loan securitizations JPMorgan Chase securitizes and sells a variety of its consumer and wholesale loans. Consumer activities include securitizations of residential real estate, credit card and automobile loans that are originated or purchased by Retail Financial Services (“RFS”), and Card Services (“CS”). Wholesale activities include securiti- zations of purchased residential real estate loans and commercial loans (prima- rily real estate–related) originated by the Investment Bank (“IB”). JPMorgan Chase–sponsored securitizations utilize SPEs as part of the securiti- zation process. These SPEs are structured to meet the definition of a QSPE (as discussed in Note 1 on page 94 of this Annual Report); accordingly, the assets and liabilities of securitization-related QSPEs are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets (except for retained interests, as described below) but are included on the balance sheet of the QSPE purchasing the assets. Assets held by securitization-related QSPEs as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, were as follows: December 31, (in billions) 2006 2005 Consumer activities Credit card receivables $ 86.4 $ 96.0 Automobile loans 4.9 5.5 Residential mortgage receivables 40.7 29.8 Wholesale activities Residential mortgages 43.8 11.1 Commercial and other (a)(b) 87.1 61.8 Total $ 262.9 $ 204.2 (a) Cosponsored securitizations include non-JPMorgan originated assets (b) Commercial and other consists of commercial loans (primarily real estate) and non-mortgage consumer receivables purchased from third parties. The Firm records a loan securitization as a sale when the accounting criteria for a sale are met. Those criteria are: (1) the transferred assets are legally iso- lated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the entity can pledge or exchange the financial assets or, if the entity is a QSPE, its investors can pledge or exchange their interests; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control via an agreement to repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity or have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets. For loan securitizations that meet the accounting sales criteria, the gains or losses recorded depend, in part, on the carrying amount of the loans sold and are allocated between the loans sold and the retained interests, based upon their relative fair values at the date of sale. Gains on securitizations are reported in Noninterest revenue. When quoted market prices for the retained interests are not available, the Firm estimates the fair value for these retained interests by determining the present value of future expected cash flows using modeling techniques. Such models incorporate management’s best esti- mates of key variables, such as expected credit losses, prepayment speeds and the discount rates appropriate for the risks involved. Interests in the securitized loans may be retained by the Firm in the form of senior or subordinated interest-only strips, senior and subordinated tranches, and escrow accounts. The classification of retained interests is dependent upon several factors, including the type of interest (e.g., whether the retained interest is represented by a security certificate) and when it was retained, due to the adoption of SFAS 155. The Firm has elected to fair value all interests in securitized loans retained after December 31, 2005, that have an embedded derivative required to be bifurcated under SFAS 155; these retained interests are classified primarily as Trading assets. Retained interests from wholesale activities are classified as Trading assets. For consumer activities, senior and subordinated retained interests represented by a security certificate are classi- fied as AFS. Retained interests not represented by a security certificate are classified in Other assets. For those retained interests that are subject to pre- payment risk (such that JPMorgan Chase may not recover substantially all of its investment) but are not required to be bifurcated under SFAS 155, the retained interests are recorded at fair value; subsequent adjustments are reflected in earnings or in Other comprehensive income (loss). Retained inter- ests classified as AFS are subject to the impairment provisions of EITF 99-20. Credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undi- vided interest in the trusts, representing the Firm’s interests in the receivables transferred to the trust that have not been securitized. These seller’s interests are not represented by security certificates. The Firm’s undivided interests are carried at historical cost and are classified in Loans.

Credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest of 4% to 12% of the principal receivables in the trusts. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables in the trusts of approximately 21% for 2006 and 23% for 2005. The Firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined limits for some credit card and automobile securitizations, to cover the unlikely event of deficiencies in cash flows owed to investors. The amounts available in such escrow accounts are recorded in Other assets and, as of December 31, 2006, amounted to $153 million and $56 million for credit card and auto- mobile securitizations, respectively; as of December 31, 2005, these amounts were $754 million and $76 million for credit card and automobile securitizations, respectively. JPMorgan Chase retains servicing responsibilities for all originated and for certain purchased residential mortgage, credit card and automobile loan securitizations and for certain commercial activity securitizations it sponsors, and receives servicing fees based upon the securitized loan balance plus cer- tain ancillary fees. The Firm also retains the right to service the residential mortgage loans it sells in connection with mortgage-backed securities trans- actions with the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). For a discussion of mortgage servic- ing rights, see Note 16 on pages 121–122 of this Annual report. In addition to the amounts reported for securitization activity on the previ- ous page, the Firm sold residential mortgage loans totaling $53.7 billion, $52.5 billion and $65.7 billion during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily as GNMA, FNMA and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities; these sales resulted in pretax gains of $251 million, $293 million and $58 million, respectively. The table below summarizes other retained securitization interests, which are primarily subordinated or residual interests, and are carried at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Consumer activities Credit card (a)(b) $ 833 $ 808 Automobile (a)(c) 168 150 Residential mortgage (a) 155 182 Wholesale activities (d) Residential mortgages 1,032 245 Commercial and other 117 20 Total $ 2,305 $ 1,405 (a) Pretax unrealized gains recorded in Stockholders’ equity that relate to retained securitization interests on consumer activities totaled $3 million and $6 million for credit card; $4 million and $5 million for automobile and $51 million and $60 million for residential mortgage at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (b) The credit card retained interest amount noted above includes subordinated securities retained by the Firm totaling $301 million and $357 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, that are classified as AFS securities. The securities are valued using quoted market prices and therefore are not included in the key economic assumptions and sensitivities table that follows. (c) In addition to the automobile retained interest amounts noted above, the Firm also retained senior securities totaling $188 million and $490 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, that are classified as AFS securities. These securities are valued using quoted market prices and therefore are not included in the key economic assumption and sensitivi- ties table that follows. (d) In addition to the wholesale retained interest amounts noted above, the Firm also retained subordinated securities totaling $23 million and $51 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, predominately from resecuritizations activities that are classified as Trading assets. These securities are valued using quoted market prices and therefore are not included in the key assumptions and sensitivities table that follows. The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s retained interests in its securitizations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively; and it outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions: Expected static-pool net credit losses include actual incurred losses plus projected net credit losses, divided by the original balance of the outstandings comprising the securitization pool. The table below displays the expected static-pool net credit losses for 2006, 2005 and 2004, based upon secur itizations occurring in that year: Loans securitized in: (a) 2006 2005 2004 (c) Residential mortgage (b) Automobile Residential mortgage (b) Automobile Residential mortgage Automobile December 31, 2006 4.4% 0.6% 3.5% 0.7% 0.0–3.1% 0.7% December 31, 2005 NA NA 3.3 0.9 0.0–2.4 0.8 December 31, 2004 NA NA NA NA 0.0–3.3 1.1 (a) Static-pool losses are not applicable to credit card securitizations due to their revolving nature. (b) Primarily includes subprime residential mortgages securitized in 2006 and 2005 as part of wholesale activities. Expected loss es for prime residential mortgage securitizations are minimal for con- sumer activities. (c) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 117 The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based upon a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily because the relationship of the change in the assump- tions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities.

(e) Excludes nonperforming assets related to (i) loans eligible for repurchase as well as loans repurchased from GNMA pools that are insured by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and (ii) education loans that are 90 da ys past due and still accruing, which are insured by U.S. government agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan Program of $0.2 billion at December 31, 2006. These amounts for GNMA and educati on loans are excluded, as reimbursement is proceeding normally. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 118 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 15 – Variable interest entities Refer to Note 1 on page 94 of this Annual Report for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities. JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with VIEs occurs in the following business segments: • Investment Bank: Utilizes VIEs to assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner by providing flexibility relating to price, yield and desired risk. There are two broad categories of transactions involving VIEs in the IB: (1) multi-seller conduits and (2) client intermedia- tion; both are discussed below. The IB also securitizes loans through QSPEs, to create asset-backed securities, as further discussed in Note 14 on pages 114–118 of this Annual Report. • Asset Management (“AM”): Provides investment management services to a limited number of the Firm’s mutual funds deemed VIEs. AM earns a fixed fee based upon assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For the limited number of funds that qualify as VIEs, AM’s relationships with such funds are not con- sidered significant variable interests under FIN 46R. • Treasury & Securities Services: Provides services to a number of VIEs. These services are similar to those provided to non-VIEs. TSS earns market-based fees for services provided. Such relationships are not considered significant variable interests under FIN 46R. • Commercial Banking: Utilizes VIEs to assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner. This is often accomplished through the use of products similar to those offered in the Investment Bank. Commercial Banking may assist in the structuring and/or on-going admin- istration of these VIEs and may provide liquidity, letters of credit and/or derivative instruments in support of the VIE. Such relationships are not considered significant variable interests under FIN 46R. • The Private Equity business, included in Corporate, may be involved with entities that could be deemed VIEs. Private equity activities are accounted for in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (“Audit Guide”). The FASB deferred adoption of FIN 46R for nonregistered invest- ment companies that apply the Audit Guide until the proposed Statement of Position on the clarification of the scope of the Audit Guide is finalized. The Firm continues to apply this deferral provision; had FIN 46R been applied to VIEs subject to this deferral, the impact would have had an insignificant impact on the Firm’s Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. As noted above, there are two broad categories of transactions involving VIEs with which the IB is involved: multi-seller conduits and client intermediation. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 119 The Firm also provides vehicles with program-wide liquidity, in the form of revolving and short-term lending commitments, in the event of short-term dis- ruptions in the commercial paper market. Deal-specific credit enhancement that supports the commercial paper issued by the conduits is generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets and is provided primarily by customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. The deal-specific credit enhancement is typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller but also may include any combination of the following: recourse to the seller or originator, cash collateral accounts, letters of credit, excess spread, retention of subordinated interests or third-party guarantees. In certain instances, the Firm provides limited credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. In June 2006, the Firm restructured four multi-seller conduits that it adminis- ters: each conduit issued a capital note that was acquired by an independent third-party investor who absorbs the majority of the expected losses of the respective conduit whose note it had purchased. In determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits, the Firm used a Monte Carlo–based model to size the expected losses and considered the relative rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders. As a result of the restructuring, the Firm deconsolidated approximately $33 billion of assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2006. The following table summarizes the Firm’s involvement with Firm- administered multi-seller conduits: Multi-seller conduits The Firm is an active participant in the asset-backed securities business, helping meet customers’ financing needs by providing access to the commercial paper markets through VIEs known as multi-seller conduits. These companies are sep- arate bankruptcy-remote companies in the business of purchasing interests in, and making loans secured by, receivable pools and other financial assets pur- suant to agreements with customers. The companies fund their purchases and loans through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flow from the pools of assets. JPMorgan Chase serves as the administrator and provides contingent liquidity support and limited credit enhancement for several multi-seller conduits. The commercial paper issued by the conduits is backed by collateral, credit enhance- ments and commitments to provide liquidity sufficient to enable the conduit to receive a liquidity rating of at least A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, F1. As a means of ensuring timely repayment of the commercial paper, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it. The liquidity facilities are typically in the form of asset purchase agreements and are generally structured such that the liquidity is provided by the Firm purchasing, or lending against, a pool of nondefaulted, performing assets. Deal-specific liquidity facilities are the primary source of liquidity support for the conduits. Consolidated Nonconsolidated Total December 31, (in billions) 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Total commercial paper issued by conduits $ 3.4 $ 35.2 $ 44.1 $ 8.9 $ 47.5 $ 44.1 Commitments Asset-purchase agreements $ 0.5 $ 47.9 $ 66.0 $ 14.3 $ 66.5 $ 62.2 Program-wide liquidity commitments 1.0 5.0 4.0 1.0 5.0 6.0 Program-wide limited credit enhancements — 1.3 1.6 1.0 1.6 2.3 Maximum exposure to loss (a) 1.0 48.4 67.0 14.8 68.0 63.2 (a) The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the amount of drawn commitments (i.e., sellers’ assets held by the multi-seller conduits for which the Firm provides liquidity support) of $43.9 billion and $41.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, plus contractual but undrawn commitments of $24.1 billion a nd $21.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Certain of the Firm’s administered multi-seller conduits were deconsolidated as of June 30, 2006; the assets deconsolidated were approximately $33 billion. Since the Firm provides credit enhance- ment and liquidity to Firm administered multi-seller conduits, the maximum exposure is not adjusted to exclude exposure that wou ld be absorbed by third-party liquidity providers. The Firm views its credit exposure to multi-seller conduit transactions as limited. This is because, for the most part, the Firm is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if the assets in the VIE are in default. Additionally, the Firm’s obligations under the letters of credit are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the customer or other third parties – for example, by the overcollateralization of the VIE with the assets sold to it or notes subordinat- ed to the Firm’s liquidity facilities. Client intermediation As a financial intermediary, the Firm is involved in structuring VIE transactions to meet investor and client needs. The Firm intermediates various types of risks (including fixed income, equity and credit), typically using derivative instruments as further discussed below. In certain circumstances, the Firm also provides liquidity and other support to the VIEs to facilitate the transaction. The Firm’s current exposure to nonconsolidated VIEs is reflected in its Consolidated balance sheets or in the Notes to consolidated financial state- ments. The risks inherent in derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit, market and liquidity risks to which the Firm is exposed. The Firm intermediates principally with the following types of VIEs: credit-linked note vehicles and municipal bond vehicles. 120 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report The Firm structures credit-linked notes in which the VIE purchases highly rated assets (such as asset-backed securities) and enters into a credit derivative con- tract with the Firm to obtain exposure to a referenced credit not held by the VIE. Credit-linked notes are issued by the VIE to transfer the risk of the refer- enced credit to the investors in the VIE. Clients and investors often prefer a VIE structure, since the credit-linked notes generally carry a higher credit rat- ing than they would if issued directly by JPMorgan Chase. The Firm is involved with municipal bond vehicles for the purpose of creating a series of secondary market trusts that allow tax-exempt investors to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates. The VIE purchases fixed-rate, longer-term highly rated municipal bonds by issuing puttable floating-rate certificates and inverse floating-rate certificates; the investors that purchase the inverse floating-rate certificates are exposed to the residual losses of the VIE (the “residual interests”). For vehicles in which the Firm owns the residual interests, the Firm consolidates the VIE. In vehicles in which third-party investors own the residual interests, the Firm’s exposure is limited because of the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the unwind triggers based upon the market value of the underlying collateral and the residual interests held by third parties. The Firm often serves as remarketing agent for the VIE and provides liquidity to support the remarketing. Assets held by credit-linked and municipal bond vehicles at December 31, 2006 and 2005, were as follows: December 31, (in billions) 2006 2005 Credit-linked note vehicles (a) $ 20.2 $ 13.5 Municipal bond vehicles (b) 16.9 13.7 (a) Assets of $1.8 billion reported in the table above were recorded on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, due to contractual relationships held by the Firm that relate to collateral held by the VIE. (b) Total amounts consolidated due to the Firm owning residual interests were $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are reported in the table. Total liquidity commitments were $10.2 billion and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Firm’s maximum credit exposure to all municipal bond vehicles was $14.9 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Firm may enter into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These transactions can include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s length, and individual credit decisions are based upon the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into con- sideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where these activities do not cause JPMorgan Chase to absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIEs or to receive a majority of the residual returns of the VIE, JPMorgan Chase records and reports these positions similarly to any other third-party transac- tion. These transactions are not considered significant for disclosure purposes. Consolidated VIE assets The following table summarizes the Firm’s total consolidated VIE assets, by classification, on the Consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005: December 31, (in billions) 2006(d) 2005 Consolidated VIE assets (a) Securities purchased under resale agreements (b) $8 . 0 $ 2.6 Trading assets (c) 9.8 9.3 Investment securities 0.2 1.9 Interests in purchased receivables — 29.6 Loans(b) 15.9 8.1 Other assets 2.9 0.4 Total consolidated assets $ 36.8 $ 51.9 (a) The Firm also holds $3.5 billion and $3.9 billion of assets, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily as a seller’s interest, in certain consumer securitizations in a segregated entity, as part of a two-step securitization transaction. This interest is included in the securitization activities disclosed in Note 14 on pages 114–118 of this Annual Report. (b) Includes activity conducted by the Firm in a principal capacity, primarily in the IB. (c) Includes the fair value of securities and derivative receivables. (d) Certain multi-seller conduits administered by the Firm were deconsolidated as of June 30, 2006; the assets deconsolidated consisted of $29 billion of Interests in purchased receiv- ables, $3 billion of Loans and $1 billion of investment securities. Interests in purchased receivables included interests in receivables purchased by Firm-administered conduits, which had been consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R. Interests in purchased receivables were carried at cost and reviewed to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment existed. The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities” on the Consolidated balance sheets. The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 19 on page 124 of this Annual Report for the maturity profile of FIN 46 long-term beneficial interests. FIN 46(R)-6 Transition In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-6, which requires an analysis of the design of a VIE in determining the variability to be considered in the application of FIN 46(R). The Firm adopted the guidance in FSP FIN 46(R)-6 prospectively on July 1, 2006. The adoption of FSP FIN 46(R)-6 did not signifi- cantly change the way in which the Firm evaluated its interests in VIEs under FIN 46(R); thus, it had an immaterial impact on the Firm’s consolidated finan- cial statements. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 121 Note 16 – Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill is not amortized. It is instead tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142 at the reporting-unit segment, which is generally one level below the six major reportable business segments (as described in Note 33 on pages 139–141 of this Annual Report); plus Private Equity (which is included in Corporate). Goodwill is tested annually (during the fourth quarter) or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be impairment. Intangible assets determined to have indefi- nite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annu- ally, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. Other acquired intangi- ble assets determined to have finite lives, such as core deposits and credit card relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits of the intangible asset. In addition, impair- ment testing is performed periodically on these amortizing intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Goodwill $ 45,186 $ 43,621 Mortgage servicing rights 7,546 6,452 Purchased credit card relationships 2,935 3,275 All other intangibles: Other credit card–related intangibles $ 302 $ 124 Core deposit intangibles 2,623 2,705 Other intangibles 1,446 2,003 Total All other intangible assets $ 4,371 $ 4,832 Goodwill As of December 31, 2006, Goodwill increased by $1.6 billion compared with December 31, 2005. The increase is due principally to the $1.8 billion of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses of The Bank of New York, as well as $510 million of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services. The increase from acquisitions was offset partially by a reduction to Goodwill: of $402 million due to the sale of selected corporate trust business- es to The Bank of New York; resulting from purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business; of $111 million due to the sale of the insurance business; and of $70 million related to reclassifying net assets of a subsidiary as held-for-sale. Goodwill attributed to the business segments was as follows: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Investment Bank $ 3,526 $ 3,531 Retail Financial Services 16,955 14,991 Card Services 12,712 12,984 Commercial Banking 2,901 2,651 Treasury & Securities Services 1,605 2,062 Asset Management 7,110 7,025 Corporate (Private Equity) 377 377 Total Goodwill $ 45,186 $ 43,621 Mortgage servicing rights JPMorgan Chase recognizes as intangible assets mortgage servicing rights, which represent the right to perform specified residential mortgage servicing activities for others. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or retained upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans. Servicing activities include col- lecting principal, interest, and escrow payments from borrowers; making tax and insurance payments on behalf of the borrowers; monitoring delinquencies and executing foreclosure proceedings; and accounting for and remitting prin- cipal and interest payments to the investors of the mortgage-backed securities. The amount initially capitalized as MSRs represents the amount paid to third parties to acquire MSRs or is the estimate of fair value, if retained upon the sale or securitization of mortgage loans. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs for initial capitalization and ongoing valuation using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s proprietary prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model consid- ers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenues, and costs to service, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value esti- mates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. JPMorgan Chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives, AFS securities and trading instruments to manage changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instru- ments. MSRs decrease in value when interest rates decline. Conversely, securi- ties (such as mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and cer- tain derivatives (when the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 156, which permits an entity a one- time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets. JPMorgan Chase elected to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2006, and defined MSRs as one class of servicing assets for this election. At the transition date, the fair value of the MSRs exceeded their carrying amount, net of any related valuation allowance, by $150 million net of taxes. This amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2006. MSRs are recognized in the Consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and changes in their fair value are recorded in current-period earnings. During 2006, as in prior years, revenue amounts related to MSRs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of MSRs are recorded in Mortgage fees and related income. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, MSRs were accounted for under SFAS 140, using a lower of cost or fair value approach. Under this approach, MSRs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans. For purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of MSRs, the Firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics, which are loan type and interest rate. Any indicated impairment was recognized as a reduction in rev- enue through a valuation allowance, which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stratum exceeded its estimated fair value. Any gross carrying value and related valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recovered in the foreseeable future, based upon the inter- est rate scenario, were considered to be other-than-temporary. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 122 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Prior to the adoption of SFAS 156, the Firm designated certain derivatives used to risk manage MSRs (e.g., a combination of swaps, swaptions and floors) as SFAS 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk. SFAS 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged MSRs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings. The designated hedge period was daily. In designating the benchmark interest rate, the Firm consid- ered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepay- ment speed estimates in determining the fair value of the MSRs. Hedge effec- tiveness was assessed using a regression analysis of the change in fair value of the MSRs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives. The valuation adjust- ments to both the MSRs and SFAS 133 derivatives were recorded in Mortgage fees and related income. With the election to apply fair value accounting to the MSRs under SFAS 156, SFAS 133 hedge accounting is no longer necessary. For a further discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 28 on pages 131–132 of this Annual Report. The following table summarizes MSR activity, certain key assumptions, and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in those key assump- tions for the year ended December 31, 2006, during which MSRs were accounted for under SFAS 156. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except rates and where otherwise noted) 2006 Balance at beginning of period after valuation allowance $ 6,452 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 230 Fair value at beginning of period 6,682 Originations of MSRs 1,512 Purchase of MSRs 627 Total additions 2,139 Sales — Change in valuation due to inputs and assumptions (a) 165 Other changes in fair value(b) (1,440) Fair value at December 31 $ 7,546 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (CPR) 17.02% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (381) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (726) Weighted-average discount rate 9.32% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (254) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (491) Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in Mortgage fees and related income $ 2,038 Third-party Mortgage loans serviced at December 31 (in billions) $5 2 7 CPR: Constant prepayment rate. (a) Represents MSR asset fair value adjustments due to changes in inputs, such as interest rates and volatility, as well as updates to assumptions used in the valuation model. (b) Includes changes in the MSR value due to servicing portfolio runoff (or time decay). The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based upon a 10% and 20% varia- tion in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated because the rela- tionship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assump- tion may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, during which MSRs were accounted for under SFAS 140. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except rates and where otherwise noted) 2005 (c) 2004(d) Balance at January 1 $ 6,111 $ 6,159 Originations of MSRs 1,301 1,089 Purchase of MSRs 596 668 Total additions 1,897 1,757 Bank One merger NA 90 Sales — (3) Other-than-temporary impairment (1) (149) Amortization (1,295) (1,297) SFAS 133 hedge valuation adjustments 90 (446) Balance at December 31 6,802 6,111 Less: valuation allowance(a) 350 1,031 Balance at December 31, after valuation allowance$ 6,452 $ 5,080 Estimated fair value at December 31 $ 6,682 $ 5,124 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (CPR) 17.56% 17.29% Weighted-average discount rate 9.68% 7.93% Valuation allowance at January 1 $ 1,031 $ 1,378 Other-than-temporary impairment(b) (1) (149) SFAS 140 impairment (recovery) adjustment (680) (198) Valuation allowance at December 31 $ 350 $ 1,031 Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in Mortgage fees and related income $ 1,769 $ 1,721 Third-party Mortgage loans serviced at December 31 (in billions) $ 468 $ 431 (a) The valuation allowance in the preceding table at December 31, 2005 and 2004, represent- ed the extent to which the carrying value of MSRs exceeded the estimated fair value for its applicable SFAS 140 strata. Changes in the valuation allowance were the result of the recognition of impairment or the recovery of previously recognized impairment charges due to changes in market conditions during the period. (b) The Firm recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of its MSRs of $1 million and $149 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which permanently reduced the gross carrying value of the MSRs and the related valuation allowance. The permanent reduction precluded sub- sequent reversals. This write-down had no impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the Firm. (c) During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Firm began valuing MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) valuation model. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, MSRs were valued using cash flows and discount rates determined by a “static” or single interest rate path valuation model. (d) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. CPR: Constant prepayment rate JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 123 Note 17 – Premises and equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or 10 years. JPMorgan Chase has recorded immaterial asset retirement obligations related to asbestos remediation under SFAS 143 and FIN 47 in those cases where it has sufficient information to estimate the obligations’ fair value. The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows: 2006 2005 Net Net Gross Accumulated carrying Gross Accumulated carrying December 31, (in millions) amount amortization value amount amortization value Purchased credit card relationships $ 5,716 $ 2,781 $ 2,935 $ 5,325 $ 2,050 $ 3,275 All other intangibles: Other credit card–related intangibles 367 65 302 183 59 124 Core deposit intangibles 4,283 1,660 2,623 3,797 1,092 2,705 Other intangibles (a) 1,961 515 (b) 1,446 2,582 579 (b) 2,003 (a) Amounts at December 31, 2006, exclude, and amounts at December 31,2005, include, other intangibles and related accumulated amorti zation of selected corporate trust businesses related to the transaction with The Bank of New York.

Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life, and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis. Purchased credit card relationships and All other intangible assets During 2006, Purchased credit card relationship intangibles decreased by $340 million as a result of $731 million in amortization expense, partially offset by increases from various acquisitions of private-label portfolios and purchase accounting adjustments related to the November 2005 acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business. During 2006, all other intangible assets declined $461 million, primarily as a result of amortization expense and a reduction of $436 million related to the transfer of selected corporate trust businesses to The Bank of New York, partially offset by an increase in core deposit intangibles of $485 million resulting from the acquisition of The Bank of New York's consumer, business banking and middle-market banking businesses, and further purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business. Except for $513 million of indefinite-lived intangibles related to asset management advisory con- tracts that are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, the remainder of the Firm’s other acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization.

The following table is a summary of long-term debt carrying values (including unamortized original issue discount, SFAS 133 valu ation adjustments and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by contractual maturity for the current year. 2006 By remaining maturity at December 31, 2006 Under After 2005 (in millions, except rates) 1 year 1–5 years 5 years Total Total Parent company Senior debt: (a) Fixed rate $ 5,468 $ 12,162 $ 2,686 $ 20,316 $ 24,920 Variable rate 3,299 22,506 2,459 28,264 16,914 Interest rates (b) 4.13–5.50% 0.75–12.48% 1.25–10.37% 0.75–12.48% 0.22–8.85% Subordinated debt: Fixed rate $ 1,858 $ 9,145 $ 15,009 $ 26,012 $ 24,817 Variable rate — 24 1,965 1,989 1,823 Interest rates (b) 6.70–7.60% 1.60–10.00% 1.92–9.88% 1.60–10.00% 1.92–10.00% Subtotal $ 10,625 $ 43,837 $ 22,119 $ 76,581 $ 68,474 Subsidiaries Senior debt: (a) Fixed rate $ 2,159 $ 4,080 $ 4,210 $ 10,449 $ 6,744 Variable rate 15,488 20,459 5,269 41,216 32,009 Interest rates (b) 3.59–5.57% 2.43–17.00% 1.76–9.00% 1.76–17.00% 1.71–17.00% Subordinated debt: Fixed rate $ — $ 828 $ 3,197 $ 4,025 $ 1,130 Variable rate — — 1,150 1,150 — Interest rates (b) —% 6.13–6.70% 4.38–8.25% 4.38–8.25% 6.13–8.25% Subtotal $ 17,647 $ 25,367 $ 13,826 $ 56,840 $ 39,883 Total long-term debt $ 28,272 $ 69,204 $ 35,945 $ 133,421 (d)(e)(f)(g) $ 108,357 FIN 46R long-term beneficial interests: (c) Fixed rate $ 7 $ 347 $ 423 $ 777 $ 465 Variable rate 63 129 7,367 7,559 1,889 Interest rates (b) 5.85–7.12% 1.73–8.75% 3.26–12.79% 1.73–12.79% 0.51–12.79% Total FIN 46R long-term beneficial interests $ 70 $ 476 $ 7,790 $ 8,336 $ 2,354 (a) Included are various equity-linked or other indexed instruments. Embedded derivatives separated from hybrid securities in acc ordance with SFAS 133 are reported at fair value and shown net with the host contract on the Consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of separated derivatives are recorded in Princi pal transactions revenue. Hybrid securities which the Firm has elected to measure at fair value in accordance with SFAS 155 are classified in the line item of the host contract on the Consolidated b alance sheets; changes in fair values are recorded in Principal transac- tions revenue in the Consolidated statements of income. (b) The interest rates shown are the range of contractual rates in effect at year end, including non-U.S. dollar-fixed- and variab le-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in SFAS 133 hedge accounting relationships if applicable. The use of these derivative instruments modifies the Firm’s exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table above. Including the effects of the SFAS 133 hedge accounting derivatives, the range of modified rates in effect at December 31, 2 006, for total long-term debt was 0.11% to 17.00%, versus the contractual range of 0.75% to 17.00% presented in the table above. (c) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities. (d) At December 31, 2006, long-term debt aggregating $27.3 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in p art, prior to maturity, based upon the terms specified in the respective notes. (e) The aggregate principal amount of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2006 is $28.3 billion in 2007, $22.9 billion in 2008, $18.1 billion in 2009, $10.6 billion in 2010 and $17.6 billion in 2011. (f) Includes $3.0 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2006. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities was $6.8 billion.

Note 18 – Deposits At December 31, 2006 and 2005, time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more were as follows: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 U.S. $ 110,812 $ 80,861 Non-U.S. 51,138 34,912 Total $ 161,950 $ 115,773 At December 31, 2006, the maturities of time deposits were as follows: December 31, 2006 (in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. Total 2007 $ 132,313 $ 62,874 $195,187 2008 2,692 769 3,461 2009 1,200 653 1,853 2010 617 605 1,222 2011 621 486 1,107 After 5 years 735 784 1,519 Total $ 138,178 $ 66,171 $204,349 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 125 Note 20 – Preferred stock JPMorgan Chase is authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share. There was no outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2006. Outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2005, was 280,433 shares. On March 31, 2006, JPMorgan Chase redeemed all 280,433 shares of its 6.63% Series H cumu- lative preferred stock. Dividends on shares of the Series H preferred stock were payable quarterly. The weighted-average contractual interest rate for total Long-term debt was 4.89% and 4.62% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the asso- ciated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rate for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, was 4.99% and 4.65% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Parent Company) has guaranteed certain debt of its subsidiaries, including both long-term debt and structured notes sold as part of the Firm’s trading activities. These guarantees rank on a parity with all of the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Guaranteed liabilities totaled $30 million and $170 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities At December 31, 2006, the Firm had established 22 wholly owned Delaware statutory business trusts (“issuer trusts”) that had issued guaranteed capital debt securities. The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Firm to the issuer trusts, totaling $12.2 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated bal- ance sheets in the Liabilities section under the caption “Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities” (i.e., trust preferred capital debt securities). The Firm also records the common capital securities issued by the issuer trusts in Other assets in its Consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The debentures issued to the issuer trusts by the Firm, less the common capital securities of the issuer trusts, qualify as Tier 1 capital. The following is a summary of the outstanding capital debt securities, including unamortized original issue discount, issued by each trust and the junior subordinat ed deferrable interest debenture issued by JPMorgan Chase to each trust as of December 31, 2006: Amount of Principal Stated maturity capital debt amount of of capital securities debenture securities Earliest Interest rate of Interest issued issued Issue and redemption capital securities payment/ December 31, 2006 (in millions) by trust (a) to trust (b) date debentures date and debentures distribution dates Bank One Capital III $ 474 $ 623 2000 2030 Any time 8.75% Semiannually Bank One Capital VI 525 555 2001 2031 Any time 7.20% Quarterly Chase Capital II 495 511 1997 2027 2007 LIBOR + 0.50% Quarterly Chase Capital III 297 306 1997 2027 2007 LIBOR + 0.55% Quarterly Chase Capital VI 249 256 1998 2028 Any time LIBOR + 0.625% Quarterly First Chicago NBD Capital I 248 256 1997 2027 2007 LIBOR + 0.55% Quarterly First Chicago NBD Institutional Capital A 499 549 1996 2026 Any time 7.95% Semiannually First Chicago NBD Institutional Capital B 250 273 1996 2026 Any time 7.75% Semiannually First USA Capital Trust I 3 3 1996 2027 2007 9.33% Semiannually JPM Capital Trust I 750 773 1996 2027 2007 7.54% Semiannually JPM Capital Trust II 400 412 1997 2027 2007 7.95% Semiannually J.P .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 126 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 21 – Common stock At December 31, 2006, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0 billion shares of common stock with a $1 par value per share. Common shares issued (newly issued or distributed from treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (b) Issued – balance at January 1 3,618.2 3,584.8 2,044.4 Newly issued: Employee benefits and compensation plans 39.3 34.0 69.0 Employee stock purchase plans 0.6 1.4 3.1 Purchase accounting acquisitions and other — — 1,469.4 Total newly issued 39.9 35.4 1,541.5 Cancelled shares (0.3) (2.0) (1.1) Total issued – balance at December 31 3,657.8 3,618.2 3,584.8 Treasury – balance at January 1 (131.5) (28.6) (1.8) Purchase of treasury stock (90.7) (93.5) (19.3) Share repurchases related to employee stock-based awards (a) (8.8) (9.4) (7.5) Issued from treasury: Employee benefits and compensation plans 34.4 —— Employee stock purchase plans 0.5 —— Total issued from treasury 34.9 —— Total treasury – balance at December 31 (196.1) (131.5) (28.6) Outstanding 3,461.7 3,486.7 3,556.2 (a) Participants in the Firm’s stock-based incentive plans may have shares withheld to cover income taxes. The shares withheld amounted to 8.1 million, 8.2 million and 5.7 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (b) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Firm repurchased 91 million shares, 94 mil- lion shares and 19 million shares, respectively, of common stock under stock repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 464 million unissued shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee or director incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans. Note 22 – Earnings per share SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) in the Consolidated statement of income. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is comput- ed using the same method as basic EPS but, in the denominator, the number of common shares reflect, in addition to outstanding shares, the potential dilution that could occur if convertible securities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted or exercised into common stock. Net income available for common stock is the same for basic EPS and diluted EPS, as JPMorgan Chase had no convertible securities, and therefore, no adjustments to Net income available for common stock were necessary. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for 2006, 2005 and 2004: Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 2004 (b) Basic earnings per share Income from continuing operations $ 13,649 $ 8,254 $ 4,260 Discontinued operations 795 229 206 Net income 14,444 8,483 4,466 Less: preferred stock dividends 4 13 52 Net income applicable to common stock $ 14,440 $ 8,470 $ 4,414 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,470.1 3,491.7 2,779.9 Income from continuing operations per share $ 3.93 $ 2.36 $ 1.51 Discontinued operations per share 0.23 0.07 0.08 Net income per share $ 4.16 $ 2.43 $ 1.59 Diluted earnings per share Net income applicable to common stock $ 14,440 $ 8,470 $ 4,414 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,470.1 3,491.7 2,779.9 Add: Employee restricted stock, RSUs, stock options and SARs 103.8 65.6 70.7 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding (a) 3,573.9 3,557.3 2,850.6 Income from continuing operations per share $ 3.82 $ 2.32 $ 1.48 Discontinued operations per share 0.22 0.06 0.07 Net income per share $ 4.04 $ 2.38 $ 1.55 (a) Options issued under employee stock-based incentive plans to purchase 150 million, 280 million and 300 million shares of common stock were outstanding for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options were antidilutive.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 128 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Note 24 – Income taxes JPMorgan Chase and eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset-and-liability method required by SFAS 109 to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated financial statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax liability or asset for each temporary difference is determined based upon the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s busi- nesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different than those currently reported. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting and for income-tax return purposes. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table: December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Deferred tax assets Employee benefits $ 5,175 $ 3,381 Allowance for other than loan losses 3,533 3,554 Allowance for loan losses 2,910 2,745 Non-U.S. operations 566 807 Fair value adjustments 427 531 Gross deferred tax assets $ 12,611 $11,018 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation and amortization $ 3,668 $ 3,683 Leasing transactions 2,675 3,158 Non-U.S. operations 1,435 1,297 Fee income 1,216 1,396 Other, net 78 149 Gross deferred tax liabilities $ 9,072 $ 9,683 Valuation allowance $ 210 $ 110 Net deferred tax asset $ 3,329 $ 1,225 A valuation allowance has been recorded in accordance with SFAS 109, primarily relating to capital losses associated with certain portfolio investments. The components of income tax expense included in the Consolidated statements of income were as follows: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (a) Current income tax expense U.S. federal $ 5,512 $ 4,178 $ 1,613 Non-U.S. 1,656 887 653 U.S. state and local 879 311 157 Total current income tax expense 8,047 5,376 2,423 Deferred income tax (benefit) expense U.S. federal (1,628) (2,063) (382) Non-U.S. 194 316 (322) U.S. state and local (376) (44) (123) Total deferred income tax (benefit) expense (1,810) (1,791) (827) Total income tax expense from continuing operations 6,237 3,585 1,596 Total income tax expense from discontinued operations 572 147 132 Total income tax expense $ 6,809 $ 3,732 $ 1,728 (a) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. Total income tax expense includes $367 million of tax benefits recorded in 2006 as a result of tax audit resolutions. The preceding table does not reflect the tax effects of SFAS 52 foreign currency translation adjustments, SFAS 115 unrealized gains and losses on AFS securi- ties, SFAS 133 hedge transactions and certain tax benefits associated with the Firm’s employee stock-based compensation plans. Also not reflected are the cumulative tax effects of implementing in 2006, SFAS 155, which applies to certain hybrid financial instruments; SFAS 156, which accounts for servicing financial assets; and SFAS 158, which applies to defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The tax effect of all items recorded directly in Stockholders’ equity was an increase of $885 million, $425 million and $431 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earn- ings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. For 2006, such earn- ings approximated $423 million on a pretax basis. At December 31, 2006, the cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings in these subsidiaries approximated $1.9 billion. It is not practicable at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result upon repatriation of these earnings. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. compa- nies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings at a substantially reduced U.S. effective tax rate by providing a dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to the U.S. taxpayer (the “repatriation provision”). The deduction was subject to a number of limitations and requirements. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Firm applied the repatriation provision to $1.9 billion of cash from foreign earnings, resulting in a net tax benefit of $55 million. The $1.9 billion of cash was invested in accordance with the Firm’s domestic reinvestment plan pursuant to the guidelines set forth in the Act. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 129 The tax expense (benefit) applicable to securities gains and losses for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $(219) million, $(536) million and $126 million, respectively.

(b) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. Note 25 – Restrictions on cash and intercompany funds transfers JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s business is subject to examination and regula- tion by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Federal Reserve Board requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of reserve balances deposited by the Firm’s bank subsidiaries with various Federal Reserve Banks was approximately $2.2 billion in 2006 and $2.7 billion in 2005. Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans to the Firm or to other affiliates are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of all such loans is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The principal sources of JPMorgan Chase’s income (on a parent company–only basis) are dividends and interest from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the bank- ing organizations they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its sub- sidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking reg ula- tor’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. At January 1, 2007 and 2006, JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, $14.3 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without prior approval of their rele- vant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2007 will be supple- mented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year. In compliance with rules and regulations established by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, cash in the amount of $8.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, and securities with a fair value of $2.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, were segregated in special bank accounts for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers. Note 26 – Capital There are two categories of risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders’ equity, qualifying preferred stock and minority interest less goodwill and other adjustments. Tier 2 capital con- sists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1, subordinated long-term debt and other instruments qualifying as Tier 2, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets. Total regulato- ry capital is subject to deductions for investments in certain subsidiaries. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk weighted assets, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital to average adjusted on–balance sheet assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve Board to take action. Banking subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well- capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

Note 27 – Commitments and contingencies At December 31, 2006, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for banking purposes. Certain leases contain renewal options or escalation clauses providing for increased rental payments based upon maintenance, utility and tax increases or require the Firm to perform restoration work on leased premises. No lease agreement imposes restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. The following table presents required future minimum rental payments under operating leases with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31, 2006: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2007 $ 1,058 2008 1,033 2009 962 2010 865 2011 791 After 2011 6,320 Total minimum payments required (a) 11,029 Less: Sublease rentals under noncancelable subleases (1,177) Net minimum payment required $ 9,852 (a) Lease restoration obligations are accrued in accordance with SFAS 13, and are not reported as a required minimum lease payment.

At December 31, 2006, assets were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes. The significant components of the assets pledged were as follows: December 31, (in billions) 2006 2005 Reverse repurchase/securities borrowing agreements $ 291 $ 320 Securities 40 24 Loans 117 74 Trading assets and other 108 99 Total assets pledged $ 556 $ 517 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 131 Litigation reserve The Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 5, JPMorgan Chase accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. While the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in light of all information known to it at December 31, 2006, the Firm’s litigation reserves were adequate at such date. Management reviews litigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increased or decreased in the future to reflect further litigation developments. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and, with respect to such litigation, intends to continue to defend itself vigor- ously, litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what is in the best interests of stockholders. Insurance recoveries related to certain material legal proceedings were $512 million and $208 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Charges related to certain material legal proceedings were $2.8 billion and $3.7 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no charges in 2006 related to material legal proceedings. Note 28 – Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities Derivative instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to credit or market risks. The value of a derivative is derived from its reference to an underlying variable or combination of variables such as equity, foreign exchange, credit, commodity or interest rate prices or indices. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also is an end-user of derivatives in order to hedge market exposures, modify the interest rate char- acteristics of related balance sheet instruments or meet longer-term invest- ment objectives. The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for trad- ing purposes. Both trading and end-user derivatives are recorded at fair value in Trading assets and Trading liabilities as set forth in Note 4 on pages 98–99 of this Annual Report. SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 138, SFAS 149, and SFAS 155, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including those used for trading and hedging activities, and derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. All free-standing derivatives, whether designated for hedg- ing relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the Consolidated bal- ance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether the contract is for trading purposes or has been designat- ed and qualifies for hedge accounting. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be considered highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In order for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, there must be documentation of the risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, and how effectiveness is to be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, as well as nonstatistical methods including dollar value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to continue to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. Any ineffectiveness must be reported in current- period earnings. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedg- ing the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and in the fair value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged are recog- nized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and continues to be amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in Other comprehensive income and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income when the hedged cash flows affect earn- ings. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in fair value of the derivative recorded in Other comprehensive income is recognized when the cash flows that were hedged occur, consistent with the original hedge strat- egy. For hedge relationships discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy, any related derivative amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income are immediately recognized in earnings. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative or the revaluation of the foreign currency–denominated debt instrument are recorded in the translation adjustments account within Other comprehensive income. JPMorgan Chase’s fair value hedges primarily include hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt, loans, AFS securities and MSRs. Interest rate swaps are the most common type of derivative contract used to modify exposure to interest rate risk, converting fixed-rate assets and liabilities to a floating rate. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 156, interest rate options, swaptions and forwards were also used in combination with interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs in SFAS 133 hedge relationships. For a further discussion of MSR risk management activities, see Note 16 on pages 121–122 of this Annual Report. All amounts have been included in earnings consistent with the classification of the hedged item, primarily Net interest income, Mortgage fees and related income, and Other income. The Firm did not recognize any gains or losses during 2006, 2005 or 2004 on firm commitments that no longer qualify as fair value hedges. JPMorgan Chase also enters into derivative contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from floating-rate financial instruments and forecast- ed transactions, primarily the rollover of short-term assets and liabilities, and foreign currency–denominated revenues and expenses. Interest rate swaps, futures and forward contracts are the most common instruments used to reduce the impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes on future earnings. All amounts affecting earnings have been recognized consis- tent with the classification of the hedged item, primarily Net interest income. The Firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency–denominated debt instruments to protect the value of net invest- ments in subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The por- tion of the hedging instruments excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (forward points) is recorded in Net interest income. The following table presents derivative instrument hedging-related activities for the periods indicated: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (b) Fair value hedge ineffective net gains/(losses) (a) $5 1 $ (58) $ 199 Cash flow hedge ineffective net gains/(losses) (a) 2 (2) — Cash flow hedging gains/(losses) on forecasted transactions that failed to occur — —1 (a) Includes ineffectiveness and the components of hedging instruments that have been excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. (b) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 132 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Over the next 12 months, it is expected that $67 million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in Other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006, will be recognized in earnings. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities. JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the Firm’s economic hedges. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to standard credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk of loans and com- mitments because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges under SFAS 133. Similarly, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to cer- tain interest rate derivatives used as economic hedges. Note 29 – Off –balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees JPMorgan Chase utilizes lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment or the Firm fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and the counterparty subsequently fail to per- form according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without a default occurring or without being drawn. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding require- ments. Further, certain commitments, primarily related to consumer financings, are cancelable, upon notice, at the option of the Firm. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 13 on pages 113–114 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts of off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees and the related allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at December 31, 2006 and 2005: Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees Allowance for Contractual lending-related amount commitments December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2006 2005 Lending-related Consumer (a) $ 747,535 $ 655,596 $2 5 $1 5 Wholesale: Other unfunded commitments to extend credit (b)(c)(d) 229,204 208,469 305 208 Asset purchase agreements (e) 67,529 31,095 6 3 Standby letters of credit and guarantees(c)(f)(g) 89,132 77,199 187 173 Other letters of credit (c) 5,559 4,346 1 1 Total wholesale 391,424 321,109 499 385 Total lending-related $1,138,959 $ 976,705 $ 524 $ 400 Other guarantees Securities lending guarantees(h) $ 318,095 $ 244,316 NA NA Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 71,531 61,759 NA NA (a) Includes Credit card lending-related commitments of $657 billion at December 31, 2006, and $579 billion at December 31, 2005, which represent the total available credit to the Firm’s cardholders. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all of its cardholders will utilize their entire available lines of credit at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel a credit card commitment by providing the cardholder prior notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. (b) Includes unused advised lines of credit totaling $39.0 billion and $28.3 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are not legally binding. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve Board, unused advised lines are not reportable. (c) Represents contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $32.8 billion and $29.3 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (d) Excludes unfunded commitments to private third-party equity funds of $589 million and $242 million at December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. (e) Represents asset purchase agreements with the Firm’s administered multi-seller asset- backed commercial paper conduits, which excludes $356 million and $32.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to conduits that were consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R, as the underlying assets of the conduits are reported in the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. It also includes $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of asset purchase agreements to other third-party entities at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Certain of the Firm’s administered multi-seller conduits were deconsolidated as of June 2006; the assets deconsolidated were approximately $33 billion. (f) JPMorgan Chase held collateral relating to $13.5 billion and $9.0 billion of these arrange- ments at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (g) Includes unused commitments to issue standby letters of credit of $45.7 billion and $37.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (h) Collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $317.9 billion and $245.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Unfunded commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend only when a customer has complied with predetermined conditions, and they generally expire on fixed dates. FIN 45 establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, requiring that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party, based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending arrangements to be guarantees under FIN 45: certain asset purchase agreements,standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agree- ments included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain deriva- tive contracts. These guarantees are described in further detail below. The fair value at inception of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantees and commitments that qualify under FIN 45 is typically equal to the net present value of the future amount of premium receivable under the contract. The Firm has recorded this amount in Other Liabilities with an off- setting entry recorded in Other Assets. As cash is received under the contract, it is applied to the premium receivable recorded in Other Assets, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as Lending & deposit related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The amount of the liability related to FIN 45 guarantees recorded at December 31, 2006 and 2005, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments and derivative contracts discussed below, was approximately $297 million and $313 million, respectively. Asset purchase agreements The majority of the Firm’s unfunded commitments are not guarantees as defined in FIN 45, except for certain asset purchase agreements that are prin- cipally used as a mechanism to provide liquidity to SPEs, primarily multi-seller conduits, as described in Note 15 on pages 118–120 of this Annual Report. Some of these asset purchase agreements can be exercised at any time by the SPE’s administrator, while others require a triggering event to occur. Triggering events include, but are not limited to, a need for liquidity, a decline JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 133 in market value of the assets or a downgrade in the rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. These agreements may cause the Firm to purchase an asset from the SPE at an amount above the asset’s fair value, in effect providing a guarantee of the initial value of the reference asset as of the date of the agreement. In most instances, third-party credit enhancements of the SPE mit- igate the Firm’s potential losses on these agreements. Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by JPMorgan Chase to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. Approximately 50% of these arrangements mature within three years. The Firm typically has recourse to recover from the customer any amounts paid under these guarantees; in addition, the Firm may hold cash or other highly liquid collateral to support these guarantees. Securities lending indemnification Through the Firm’s securities lending program, customers’ securities, via cus- todial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm issues securities lending indemnification agreements to the lender which protects it principally against the failure of the third-party borrower to return the lent securities. To support these indemnification agree- ments, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower . Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists or released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If an indem- nifiable default by a borrower occurs, the Firm would expect to use the collat- eral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending customer with the cash equivalent thereof. Also, as part of this program, the Firm invests cash collateral received from the borrower in accordance with approved guidelines. On an exceptional basis the Firm may indemnify the lender against this investment risk when certain types of investments are made. Based upon historical experience, management believes that these risks of loss are remote. Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors, the Firm may enter into con- tractual arrangements with third parties that may require the Firm to make a payment to them in the event of a change in tax law or an adverse interpreta- tion of tax law. In certain cases, the contract also may include a termination clause, which would allow the Firm to settle the contract at its fair value; thus, such a clause would not require the Firm to make a payment under the indemni- fication agreement. Even without the termination clause, management does not expect such indemnification agreements to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of JPMorgan Chase. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses when it sells a business or assets to a third party, pursuant to which it indemnifies that third party for losses it may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale. See below for more information regarding the Firm’s loan securitization activities. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based upon historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Securitization-related indemnifications As part of the Firm’s loan securitization activities, as described in Note 14 on pages 114–118 of this Annual Report, the Firm provides representations and warranties that certain securitized loans meet specific requirements. The Firm may be required to repurchase the loans and/or indemnify the purchaser of the loans against losses due to any breaches of such representations or warranties. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make under such repurchase and/or indemnification provisions would be equal to the current amount of assets held by such securitization- related SPEs as of December 31, 2006, plus, in certain circumstances, accrued and unpaid interest on such loans and certain expenses. The potential loss due to such repurchase and/or indemnity is mitigated by the due diligence the Firm performs before the sale to ensure that the assets comply with the requirements set forth in the representations and warranties. Historically, losses incurred on such repurchases and/or indemnifications have been insignificant, and therefore management expects the risk of material loss to be remote. Credit card charge-backs The Firm is a partner with one of the leading companies in electronic payment services in a joint venture operating under the name of Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC (the “joint venture”). The joint venture was formed in October 2005, as a result of an agreement by the Firm and First Data Corporation, its joint venture partner, to integrate the companies’ jointly owned Chase Merchant Services (“CMS”) and Paymentech merchant businesses. The joint venture provides merchant processing services in the United States and Canada. Under the rules of Visa USA, Inc. and Mastercard International, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is liable primarily for the amount of each processed credit card sales transaction that is the subject of a dispute between a cardmember and a mer- chant. The joint venture is contractually liable to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for these disputed transactions. If a dispute is resolved in the cardmember’s favor, the joint venture will (through the cardmember’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardmember and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the joint venture is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the joint venture will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardmember. The joint venture mitigates this risk by withhold- ing future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or by obtaining other security. However, in the unlikely event that: (1) a merchant ceases operations and is unable to deliver products, services or a refund; (2) the joint venture does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant to provide customer refunds; and (3) the joint venture does not have sufficient financial resources to provide customer refunds, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. would be liable for the amount of the transaction, although it would have a contractual right to recover from its joint venture partner an amount proportionate to such part- ner’s equity interest in the joint venture. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the joint venture incurred aggregate credit losses of $9 million on $661 billion of aggregate volume processed. At December 31, 2006, the joint ven- ture held $893 million of collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the CMS and Paymentech ventures incurred aggregate credit losses of $11 million on $563 billion of aggregate volume processed. At December 31, 2005, the joint venture held $909 million of collateral. The Firm believes that, based upon historical experience and the collateral held by the joint venture, the fair value of the Firm’s chargeback-related obligations would not be differ- ent materially from the credit loss allowance recorded by the joint venture; therefore, the Firm has not recorded any allowance for losses in excess of the allowance recorded by the joint venture. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 134 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Exchange and clearinghouse guarantees The Firm is a member of several securities and futures exchanges and clearing- houses, both in the United States and other countries. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to members who dealt with the defaulting member or to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to a members’ guaranty fund, or, in a few cases, it may be unlimited. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based upon historical experience, manage- ment expects the risk of loss to be remote. Derivative guarantees In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which the Firm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated bal- ance sheets at fair value. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets from the option holder at a specified price by a spec- ified date in the future, as well as derivatives that effectively guarantee the return on a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $72 billion and $62 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to these contracts. The fair value related to these contracts was a derivative receivable of $230 million and $198 million, and a derivative payable of $987 million and $767 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Finally, certain written put options and credit derivatives permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder or the buyer of credit protection to own the reference asset. The Firm does not consider these contracts to be guarantees under FIN 45. Note 30 – Credit risk concentrations Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of the credit risk portfolio to assess potential concentration risks and to obtain collateral when deemed necessary. In the Firm’s wholesale portfolio, risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and by geographic region. In the consumer portfolio, concentrations are evaluated primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region. The Firm does not believe exposure to any one loan product with varying terms (e.g., interest-only payments for an introductory period) or exposure to loans with high loan-to-value ratios would result in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its Allowance for loan losses. For further information regarding on–balance sheet credit concentrations by major product and geography, see Note 12 on pages 112–113 of this Annual Report. For information regarding concentrations of off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments by major product, see Note 29 on page 132 of this Annual Report.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 135 Note 31 – Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The accounting for an asset or liability may differ based upon the type of instrument and/or its use in a trading or investing strategy. Generally, the measurement framework in the consolidated financial statements is one of the following: • at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded each period in the Consolidated statements of income; • at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded each period in the Accumulated other comprehensive income component of Stockholders’ equity and as part of Other comprehensive income; • at cost (less other-than-temporary impairments), with changes in fair value not recorded in the consolidated financial statements but disclosed in the notes thereto; or • at the lower of cost or fair value. Determination of fair value The Firm has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independent information as inputs to the valuation model. Valuation adjustments may be necessary to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, liquidity and concentration concerns and are based upon defined methodologies that are applied consistently over time. • Credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market price (or parameter) is not indicative of the credit quality of the counterparty. As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the majority of derivative positions are valued using internally developed models that use as their basis observable market parameters. Market practice is to quote parameters equivalent to a AA credit rating; thus, all counterparties are assumed to have the same credit quality. An adjustment is therefore necessary to reflect the credit quality of each derivative counterparty and to arrive at fair value. • Liquidity adjustments are necessary when the Firm may not be able to observe a recent market price for a financial instrument that trades in inactive (or less active) markets. Thus, valuation adjustments for the risk of loss due to a lack of liquidity are applied to those positions to arrive at fair value. The Firm tries to ascertain the amount of uncertainty in the initial valuation based upon the degree of liquidity or illiquidity, as the case may be, of the market in which the instrument trades and makes liquidity adjustments to the financial instruments. The Firm measures the liquidity adjustment based upon the following factors: (1) the amount of time since the last relevant pricing point; (2) whether there was an actual trade or relevant external quote; and (3) the volatility of the principal component of the financial instrument. • Concentration valuation adjustments are necessary to reflect the cost of unwinding larger-than-normal market-size risk positions. The cost is deter- mined based upon the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the extended period required to bring a position down to a nonconcentrated level. An estimate of the period needed to reduce, without market disruption, a position to a nonconcentrated level is generally based upon the relationship of the position to the average daily trading volume of that position. Without these adjustments, larger positions would be valued at a price greater than the price at which the Firm could exit the positions. Valuation adjustments are determined based upon established policies and are controlled by a price verification group, which is independent of the risk-taking function. Economic substantiation of models, prices, market inputs and revenue through price/input testing, as well as back-testing, is done to validate the appro- priatenessof the valuation methodology. Any changes to the valuation method- ology are reviewed by management to ensure the changes are justified. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, the use of different methodologies to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of SFAS 107. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures required by SFAS 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, the Firm has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this Note. The following items describe the methodologies and assumptions used, by financial instrument, to determine fair value. Financial assets Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value The Firm considers fair values of certain financial assets carried at cost – including cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable – to approximate their respective car- rying values, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements are typically short-term in nature and, as such, for a significant majority of the Firm’s transactions, cost approximates carrying value. This balance sheet item also includes structured resale agreements and similar products with long- dated maturities. To estimate the fair value of these instruments, cash flows are discounted using the appropriate market rates for the applicable maturity. Trading debt and equity instruments The Firm’s debt and equity trading instruments are carried at their estimated fair value. Quoted market prices, when available, are used to determinethe fair value of trading instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Securities Fair values of actively traded securities are determined by quoted external dealer prices, while the fair values for nonactively traded securities are based upon independent broker quotations. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JPMorgan Chase & Co. 136 JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report Derivatives Fair value for derivatives is determined based upon the following: • position valuation, principally based upon liquid market pricing as evidenced by exchange-traded prices, broker-dealer quotations or related input parameters, which assume all counterparties have the same credit rating; • credit valuation adjustments to the resulting portfolio valuation, to reflect the credit quality of individual counterparties; and • other fair value adjustments to take into consideration liquidity, concentration and other factors. For those derivatives valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters, the Firm defers the initial trading profit for these financial instruments. The deferred profit is recognized in Trading revenue on a systematic basis (typically straight-line amortization over the life of the instruments) and when observable market data becomes available. The fair value of derivative payables does not incorporate a valuation adjustment to reflect JPMorgan Chase’s credit quality. Interests in purchased receivables The fair value of variable-rate interests in purchased receivables approximate their respective carrying amounts due to their variable interest terms and negligible credit risk. The estimated fair values for fixed-rate interests in purchased receivables are determined using a discounted cash flow analysis using appropriate market rates for similar instruments. Loans Fair value for loans is determined using methodologies suitable for each type of loan: • Fair value for the wholesale loan portfolio is estimated, primarily using the cost of credit derivatives, which is adjusted to account for the differences in recovery rates between bonds, upon which the cost of credit derivatives is based, and loans. • Fair values for consumer installment loans (including automobile financings) and consumer real estate, for which market rates for comparable loans are readily available, are based upon discounted cash flows adjusted for prepayments. The discount rates used for consumer installment loans are current rates offered by commercial banks. For consumer real estate, secondary market yields for comparable mortgage-backed securities, adjusted for risk, are used. • Fair value for credit card receivables is based upon discounted expected cash flows. The discount rates used for credit card receivables incorporate only the effects of interest rate changes, since the expected cash flows already reflect an adjustment for credit risk. • The fair value of loans in the held-for-sale and trading portfolios is generally based upon observable market prices and upon prices of similar instruments, including bonds, credit derivatives and loans with similar characteristics. If market prices are not available, the fair value is based upon the estimated cash flows adjusted for credit risk; that risk is discounted, using a rate appropriate for each maturity. Other Commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost or fair value. For the majority of commodities inventory, fair value is determined by reference to prices in highly active and liquid markets. The fair value for other commodities inventory is determined primarily using pricing and data derived from the markets on which the underlying commodities are traded. Market prices used may be adjusted for liquidity. This caption also includes Private equity invest- ments and MSRs. For discussion of the fair value methodology for Private equity investments, see Note 4 on pages 98–99 of this Annual Report. For discussion of the fair value methodology for retained interests related to securitizations, see Note 14 on pages 114–118 of this Annual Report. For discussion of the fair value methodology for MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 121–122 of this Annual Report. Financial liabilities Liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value SFAS 107 requires that the fair value for deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value. SFAS 107 does not allow for the recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments. Fair value of commercial paper, other borrowed funds, accounts payable and accrued liabilities is considered to approximate their respective carrying values due to their short-term nature. Interest-bearing deposits Fair values of interest-bearing deposits are estimated by discounting cash flows using the appropriate market rates for the applicable maturity. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements are typically short-term in nature; as such, for a significant majority of these transactions, cost approximates carrying value. This balance sheet item also includes structured repurchase agreements and similar products with long-dated maturities. To estimate the fair value of these instruments, the cash flows are discounted using the appropriate market rates for the applicable maturity. Trading liabilities For a discussion of the fair value methodology for trading debt and equity instruments and derivatives, see the related discussions in the Financial assets section of this Note. Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs (“beneficial interests”) are generally short-term in nature and, as such, for a significant majority of the Firm’s transactions, cost approximates carrying value. The Consolidated balance sheets also include beneficial interests with long-dated maturities. The fair value of these instruments is based upon current market rates. Long-term debt-related instruments Fair value for long-term debt, including the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities, is based upon current market rates and is adjusted for JPMorgan Chase’s credit quality. Lending-related commitments Although there is no liquid secondary market for wholesale commitments, the Firm estimates the fair value of its wholesale lending-related commitments primarily using the cost of credit derivatives (which is adjusted to account for the difference in recovery rates between bonds, upon which the cost of credit derivatives is based, and loans) and loan equivalents (which represent the portion of an unused commitment expected, based upon the Firm’s average portfolio historical experience, to become outstanding in the event an obligor defaults). The Firm estimates the fair value of its consumer commitments to extend credit based upon the primary market prices to originate new commitments. It is the change in current primary market prices that provides the estimate of the fair value of these commitments. On this basis, at December 31, 2006, the estimated fair value of the Firm’s lending-related commitments was a liability of $0.2 billion, compared with $0.5 billion at December 31, 2005.

(b) Revenue is composed of Net interest income and Noninterest revenue. (c) Expense is composed of Noninterest expense and Provision for credit losses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 33 on pages 139–141 of this Annual Report. The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase & Co. / 2006 Annual Report 139 Note 33 – Business segments JPMorgan Chase is organized into six major reportable business segments — Investment Bank, Retail Financial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking (“CB”), Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management, as well as a Corporate segment. The segments are based upon the products and services provided or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of man- aged basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, on pages 32–33 of this Annual Report. For a further discus- sion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business segment results on pages 34–35 of this Annual Report. Business segment financial disclosures Effective January 1, 2006, JPMorgan Chase modified certain of its financial dis- closures to reflect more closely the manner in which the Firm’s business seg- ments are managed and to provide improved comparability with competitors. These financial disclosure revisions are reflected in this Annual Report, and the financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect the disclosure changes as if they had been in effect throughout all periods reported. A sum- mary of the changes are described below. Reported versus Operating Basis Changes The presentation of operating earnings that excluded merger costs and materi- al litigation reserve charges and recoveries from reported results has been eliminated. These items had been excluded previously from operating results because they were deemed nonrecurring; they are now included in the Corporate business segment’s results. In addition, trading-related net interest income is no longer reclassified from Net interest income to trading revenue. As a result of these changes, effective January 1, 2006, management has dis- continued reporting on an “operating” basis. Business Segment Disclosures Various wholesale banking clients, together with the related balance sheet and income statement items, were transferred among CB, IB and TSS. The primary client transfer was corporate mortgage finance from CB to IB and TSS. Capital allocation changes Effective January 1, 2006, the Firm refined its methodology for allocating cap- ital (i.e., equity) to the business segments. As a result of this refinement, RFS, CS, CB, TSS and AM have higher amounts of capital allocated to them, com- mencing in the first quarter of 2006. The revised methodology considers for each line of business, among other things, goodwill associated with such busi- ness segment’s acquisitions since the Merger. In management’s view, the revised methodology assigns responsibility to the lines of business to generate returns on the amount of capital supporting acquisition-related goodwill. As part of this refinement in the capital allocation methodology, the Firm assigned to the Corporate segment an amount of equity capital equal to the then-current book value of goodwill from and prior to the Merger. As prior periods have not been revised to reflect the new capital allocations, capital allocated to the respective lines of business for 2006 is not comparable to prior periods and certain busi- ness metrics, such as ROE, are not comparable to the current presentation. The Firm may revise its equity capital allocation methodology again in the future. Discontinued operations As a result of the transaction with The Bank of New York, selected corporate trust businesses have been transferred from TSS to the Corporate segment and reported in discontinued operations for all periods reported.

The Firm’s defi- nition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications that do not have any i mpact on Net income as reported by the lines of business or by the Firm as a whole. (b) 2004 results include six months of the combined Firm’s results and six months of heritage JPMorgan Chase results. (c) TSS reimburses the IB for credit portfolio exposures the IB manages on behalf of clients the segments share. At the time of the Merger, the reimbursement methodology was revised to be based upon pretax earnings, net of the cost of capital related to those exposures. Prior to the Merger, the credit reimbursement was based upon pretax earnings, plus the allocated capital associated with the shared clients. (d) Includes Merger costs which are reported in the Corporate segment. Merger costs attributed to the business segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (b) Investment Bank $2 $3 2 $7 4 Retail Financial Services 24 133 201 Card Services 29 222 79 Commercial Banking 1 32 3 Treasury & Securities Services 117 95 68 Asset Management 23 60 31 Corporate 109 177 889 (e) Effective January 1, 2006, RFS was reorganized into three businesses: Regional Banking, Mortgage Banking and Auto Finance. (f) Managed results for CS exclude the impact of credit card securitizations on Total net revenue, Provision for credit losses an d Average assets, as JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in evaluating credit performance and the overall performance of CS’ entire managed credit card portfolio as operations are funded, and decisions are made about allo- cating resources such as employees and capital, based upon managed information. These adjustments are eliminated in Reconciling i tems to arrive at the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results. The related securitization adjustments were as follows: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 (b) Noninterest revenue $ (3,509) $ (2,718) $ (2,353) Net interest income 5,719 6,494 5,251 Provision for credit losses 2,210 3,776 2,898 Average assets 65,266 67,180 51,084 Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results for 2006, 2005 and 2004 on a managed basis. The impact of credit card securiti- zations and tax-equivalent adjustments have been included in Reconciling items so that the total Firm results are on a reported basis. The first six months of 2004 reflect heritage JPMorgan Chase–only results and have been restated to reflect the current business segment organization and reporting classifications.
