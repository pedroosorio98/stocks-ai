(&ldquo;Nu&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nu Holdings&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) (NYSE: NU | B3: NUBR33), Nu, one of the world&rsquo;s largest digital banking platforms, today reported its unaudited results for the quarter ended on June 30, 2022 (Q2'22). Financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), unless otherwise noted. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Reports Q2&rsquo;22 Financial and Operating Results &nbsp; &nbsp; Added 5.7 million customers in the quarter and 23.6 million year-on-year (YoY), reaching a total of&nbsp; 65.3 million customers, a 57% YoY increase, reinforcing Nu&rsquo;s position as one of the largest digital banking platforms in the world. &nbsp; Revenues of $1.2 billion , +230% YoY on FX neutral basis (FXN), and Monthly Average Revenue per Active Customer (ARPAC) of $7.8 , +105% YoY FXN. &nbsp; Deposits of $13.3 billion , +87% YoY FXN, and Interest-Earning Portfolio of $3.2 billion , +220% YoY FXN. Loan-to -deposit ratio remained at 24% . &nbsp; Leading indicators have remained stable and asset quality continued normalizing post pandemic: Nu's NPL 15-90 remained at 3.7% 1 while 90+ reached 4.1% 1 . 1: Data for Brazil only. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strategic Initiatives and Business Update &nbsp; Growing and More Engaged Customer Base. Nu ended Q2'22 with a record 65.3 million customers, reaching historical highs for both retail customers and SMEs. Brazilian customers increased 51% YoY to 62.3 million , with an activity rate setting a record high of 80%. Nu customers now represent 36% of the country&rsquo;s adult population. Moreover, Nu has become the primary bank for over 55% of the monthly active customers who have been with the Company for over a year. In Mexico, Nu&acute;s customer base increased over 6x YoY to 2.7 million, consolidating the Company&rsquo;s position as the largest issuer of new credit cards in the country since H2&rsquo;21 2 . In Colombia, the Company believes that it has become the largest issuer of new credit cards in H1&rsquo;22 2 , having reached around 314,000 customers in the quarter. Together these two countries added nearly 700,000 unique customers in the second quarter. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing Client Engagement by Building a Multi-Product Platform. During the quarter, the core products, which include credit cards, Nu Account, and personal loans reached 29 million , 45 million , and 4 million active customers, respectively. &nbsp; In addition to these three core products, insurance, launched last year, reached over 700,000 active policies, the direct-to-consumer investment platform, NuInvest, reached over 5 million active customers and, the Nucripto product reached 1 million customers in July 2022, only 3 weeks after its launch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustaining Growth of Deposit Franchise. &nbsp;Deposits increased 87% YoY FXN, reaching $13.3 billion in Q2'22, with an average funding cost below the CDI rate, Brazil&rsquo;s risk-free rate. This implied significant excess liquidity, as reflected in Nu&rsquo;s 24% loan-to-deposit ratio. &nbsp; Expanding Interest-Earning Portfolio. Portfolio increased 220% YoY FXN, reaching $3.2 billion in Q2'22. Growth was driven primarily by the ramp up of personal loans, which increased 250% YoY FXN to $2.1 billion 3 in Q2'22 and accounted for 23% of the total portfolio, compared to 13% in Q2'21. Growth was also driven by new credit card consumer finance products launched during the past 12 months, including purchase financing, bank slip ( boleto ) financing and bill refinancing. &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing Nu's Share of Customer's Financial Lives. &nbsp;ARPAC expanded 105% YoY FXN to $7.8 in Q2'22, mostly driven by the maturation of the Company's customer cohorts, customers' activity rate and the rollout of new products. &nbsp; Sustaining Low Cost to Serve. Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer reached $0.8 in Q2'22 while remaining flat YoY FXN. In Q1'22, Nu recognized a one-time effect in the average cost to serve and, in Q2'22, it was impacted by the USD to BRL average FX rate appreciation. Excluding both effects, the average cost to serve would have remained stable compared to Q1&rsquo;22 and demonstrates the Company&rsquo;s ability to scale the platform with sustainable cost advantages. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: Source - Banxico and SFC. 3: Figures do not consider the changes to the write-off estimates implemented in the second quarter of 2022 to ensure better comparability across the applicable periods. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Metrics is presented for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and March 31, 2022.

In Brazil, customers totaled 62.3 million , with the SME customer base increasing 150% , growing to 2.0 million customers as of June 30, 2022, from 0.8 million as of June 30, 2021. In Mexico, Nu&acute;s customer base increased over 6x and reached 2.7 million customers . In Colombia, the number of customers grew to around 314,000 . Activity Rate increased 8.5 pp to 80% as of June 30, 2022, from 72% at the close of Q2'21, reaching another historic high, and reflecting increased engagement, along with product upsell and cross-sell to customers who continue migrating more of their financial lives to Nu&rsquo;s digital platform. Purchase Volume reached $20 billion in Q2'22, expanding 94% YoY FXN, ranking Nu as Brazil&rsquo;s #4 cards player in Brazil this quarter, in terms of purchase of volume. Volume expansion was driven by both growth in Nu&rsquo;s customer base and by the maturation of Nu&rsquo;s existing customers cohorts as well as by higher usage across Nu&rsquo;s product portfolio that comprises of credit, prepaid, secured and Ultraviolet cards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deposits increased 87% YoY FXN to $13.3 billion on June 30, 2022, reflecting growth in Nu&rsquo;s customer base together with the ongoing execution of the Company's strategy to grow its deposit franchise, a key pillar of its funding strategy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note 1: All data presented is for Brazil only.

Note 4: IEP account for all interest-bearing balances including all late balances. Source: Nu, BACEN. &nbsp; Interest-Earning Portfolio (IEP) reached $3.2 billion on June 30, 2022, increasing 220% YoY FXN, and consists of credit cards and personal loans. During Q2&rsquo;22, Nu repriced and moderated the relative growth of the personal loan portfolio, aiming at strengthening the Company&rsquo;s credit resilience, given a more uncertain short-term outlook for the Brazilian economy. At the same time, the evolution of the credit card IEP has been consistently expanding as a result of the introduction of new products and features that allow Nu customers to use their credit cards as a means of financing, with the non-late IEP primarily growing the most. These new features include the ability to finance (i) bank slips; (ii) individual purchases into installments; and (iii) PIX transfers, in all cases using existing credit card limits.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Monthly Average Revenue per Active Customer (ARPAC) increased 105% YoY FXN, to $7.8 in Q2'22. This increase largely reflects the maturation of Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts, the rollout of new products and features, as well as a healthy increase in transaction volumes, the robust expansion of Nu&acute;s interest-earning portfolio, and growth in purchase volumes and related interchange fees. Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer remained unchanged at $0.8 in Q2'22 compared to Q2'21 , both on a remaining flat in YoY and YoY FXN basis, which reflects the low expenses per customer, a result of Nu's focus on operating efficiency and the sustained expansion of the Company's ecosystem at scale.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As shown in the charts below, Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts reflect a sustained expansion in the ratios and growth of primary banking accounts, number of products per monthly active customer, and monthly ARPAC. &nbsp; Compounding Effect of More Engagement and More Cross-Sell Driving ARPAC Expansion &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note 1: Illustration assumptions i) Same amount originated monthly ii) Constant amortization rate iii) Constant roll rates. Note 2: Portfolio is equal to the sum of all cohorts' overtime. Note 3: The illustration assumes write-off at month 12 of delinquency. Source: Nu. &nbsp; Write-off methodology In Q2&rsquo;22, Nu adopted a new write-off methodology for personal loans to better align write-offs with the recovery expectations, per IFRS guidelines. The new methodology anticipates write-offs for non-performing personal loans at 120+ days instead of 360+ days, while credit card write-off days remained at 360+ days. For both products, Nu applies a partial write-off methodology, which means that only the &quot;expected recovery&quot; part of a loan that is written off is maintained on the balance sheet, under Stage 3. This change brings two impacts to the NPL trends in two ways: (i) it reduces 90+ NPL ratios by virtue of eliminating 121-360 days delinquent loans from both the numerator and the denominator of that calculation, and (ii) it increases the NPL 15-90 for personal loans, as it reduces the denominator of the ratio. Such changes do not have any impact on Nu&rsquo;s P&amp;L as these write-offs had already been fully provisioned using the ECL methodology under IFRS 9. &nbsp; &nbsp; Early Delinquency Indicators Show Stability In The Second Quarter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note 1: Both graphs refer to Brazil's NPL only. In Q2&rsquo;22, we reviewed the methodology for recovering contracted cash flows from unsecured cash flow overdue low and 360 days +120 days. Our credit card write-off methodology remains unchanged at 360+ days. Note 2: Data for Brazil only. Source: Nu &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Non-Performing Loans Delinquency Nu's NPL 15-90 as a leading indicator shows a stable picture of asset quality. Remaining at 3.7%, the ratio suggests that the post-Covid normalization cycle may have run its course. 90+ delinquency measures increased from 3.5% 4 to 4.1% 4 , in line with Nu&rsquo;s expectations. The normalization cycle in credit cards is still working its way through the 90+ measure as the delinquency inventories flow through the later-stage buckets. &nbsp; &nbsp; Portfolio Growth Continues to be the Main Driver of Provision Balance Increase &nbsp; The provision balance grew by $129 million on a FX neutral basis and following the aforementioned change in the write-off methodology. Additional provisions associated with the growth in the credit portfolio accounted for approximately 85% of this increase. The residual amount of $39 million is related to the effect of worsening risk. In the context of IFRS 9 and given the low duration of Nu&rsquo;s portfolio, additional risk provisions tend to be more sensitive to the variation in 15-90 delinquency as compared to the 90+ delinquency. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note 1: The information presented is for Nu Holdings and includes both credit card and personal loans provision balance. Note 2: Amounts presented in FX neutral. Note 3: In Q2 2022, we reviewed and changed our write-off methodology for recovery of the contractual cash-flows of NPLs arising from unsecured personal loans from 360+ days to 120+ days. Our write-off methodology for credit cards remained unchanged at 360+ days.

(&ldquo;NuFIN&rdquo;), our main financial institution, as of June 30, 22, according to CMN Resolution No. 4.955/21, as well as our commitment to maintain a 14% of minimum total capital ratio. For the purposes of this analysis, we did not consider the Central Bank of Brazil Circular No. 3.681/13, in effect as of June 30, 2022, and applicable to Nu Pagamentos S.A. (&ldquo;NuPAG&rdquo;), our main payment institution. The related capital requirements amounted to US$66M as of Q2 22. NuHoldings Cash considers an additional USD 47M already remitted to the Participation Fund. Source: Nu &nbsp; Capital &nbsp; As of June 30, 2022, Nu continued to show a strong capital position with NuFin&rsquo;s adjusted capital reaching $3.9 billion , of which 79% was cash and cash equivalents. &nbsp; Liquidity &nbsp; At the end of Q2'22, Nu had an interest-earning portfolio of $3.2 billion, while total deposits were more than four times this amount at with $13.3 billion . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; REVENUE, FINANCIAL AND TRANSACTIONAL COSTS AND GROSS PROFIT &nbsp; Revenue increased 244 % YoY, or 230 % YoY FXN, to another record high of $1.2 billion in Q2&rsquo;22. &nbsp; Revenue ($ million) Q2'22 Q2'21 Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments 853.0 184.9 Fee and Commission Income 304.5 151.2 Total 1,157.5 336.1 FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments 853.0 193.1 Fee and Commission Income 304.5 157.9 Total 1,157.5 351.0 &nbsp; Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments totaled $853.0 million in Q2&rsquo;22, increasing 361% YoY, or 342% YoY FXN, resulting mainly from higher net interest income in the consumer finance portfolio, that consists of personal loans and credit cards. The increase also reflects the rise in Brazil&rsquo;s interest rates during Q2'22 (the interbank deposit rate (CDI) averaged 12.4% p.a . in Q2'22 versus 3.2% p.a. in Q2&rsquo;21) coupled with an increase in financial assets, related to the further expansion of Nu&rsquo;s continued to expand its retail credit services in Brazil.&nbsp;Fee and Commission Income in Q2&acute;22 was $304.5 million , increasing 101% YoY , or 93% YoY FXN. This was mainly due to higher interchange fees, driven by increased credit and debit card purchase volumes as Nu continues to expand its customer base and their activity rates rise.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided increased 368% YoY, or 348% YoY FXN to $794 million in the Q2'22. This cost represented 69% of revenue in Q2'22, compared to 50% in Q2'21, reflecting the following dynamics:&nbsp; &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided ($ Million) Q2'22 Q2'21 Interest and Other Financial Expenses (407.5) (57.2) Transactional Expenses (48.0) (29.8) Credit Loss Allowance Expenses (338.5) (82.7) Total (794.0) (169.7) % of Revenue 69% 50% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest and Other Financial Expenses (407.5) (59.7) Transactional Expenses (48.0) (31.1) Credit Loss Allowance Expenses (338.5) (86.4) Total (794.0) (177.2) % Of Revenue 69% 50% &nbsp; The increase in Interest and Other Financial Expenses was mainly due to higher interest expenses on retail deposits that resulted from the increase in Brazil&rsquo;s interest rates as well as the expansion of Nu&rsquo;s retail deposits balance.&nbsp;The increase of Nu&rsquo;s interest-earning portfolio directly impacts the expansion of the Credit Loss Allowance Expenses as explained below. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Profit &nbsp; Gross Profit increased 118 % YoY and 109 % YoY FXN to $363.5 million in Q2&rsquo;22. The gross profit margin was 31% compared to 50% in Q2'21, reflecting the impact of ECL credit provisioning under IFRS 9, as well as the impact of the higher interbank deposit rate, which had a positive effect on revenues, while increasing interest expenses to a lesser extent, negatively impacting gross margins in the short-term. As the loan portfolio matures and interest rates stabilize, Nu expects gross margins to converge to those observed for more mature cohorts in the past. &nbsp; OPERATING EXPENSES &nbsp; Operating Expenses totaled $388.1 million in Q2'22, up 124% YoY , or 115% YoY FXN, but declined to 34% of total revenues from 51% in Q2'21. The main driver behind the absolute increase in operating expenses was the 90 %, or 82 % YoY FXN, growth in customer support and operations expenses, reflecting the 57% increase in Nu&rsquo;s customer base as well as investments to further enhance the overall user experience.&nbsp; In addition, General and Administrative Expenses increased 88% YoY , or 80% YoY FXN, principally due to higher share-based compensation related to the effect of associated payroll taxes expenses that arose from the YoY change in Nu&rsquo;s share price, and to an increase in headcount during the period. &nbsp; Operating Expenses ($ million) Q2'22 Q2'21 Customer Support and Operations (77.7) (41.0) General and Administrative Expenses (229.5) (122.3) Marketing Expenses (36.2) (14.6) Other Income (expenses) (44.7) 5.0 Total (388.1) (172.9) % of Revenue 34% 51% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer Support and Operations (77.7) (42.8) General and Administrative Expenses (229.5) (127.7) Marketing Expenses (36.2) (15.2) Other Income (expenses) (44.7) 5.2 Total (388.1) (180.6) % of Revenue 34% 51% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Operating Leverage &nbsp; Operating leverage is a key component of our platform and can be observed in two fronts. First, as Nu expands its credit portfolio, the Company optimizes the use of the large and low-cost deposit base and expands the net interest margin (NIM). Second, as the overall revenue level increases, there is further dilution of the low-cost operating platform and improvement of the efficiency levels. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note 1: NII (Net Interest Income) is calculated as Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments minus Interest and other financial expenses.

In addition to IFRS financials, this presentation includes certain summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial information. These summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. References in this presentation to &ldquo;R$&rdquo; refer to the Brazilian real, the official currency of Brazil. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This release includes financial measures defined as &ldquo;non-IFRS financial measures&rdquo; by the SEC, including: Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and certain FX Neutral measures and provides reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure. A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance or financial position that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company for the period, adjusted for expenses and allocated tax effects on share-based compensation in such period. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is presented because our management believes that this non-IFRS financial measure can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of our operating and financial performance, although it is not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. We also use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a key profitability measure to assess the performance of our business. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to evaluate our operating and financial performance for the following reasons: Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company&rsquo;s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period, depending on their accounting and tax methods, the book value and the market value of their assets and liabilities, and the method by which their assets were acquired. Non-cash equity grants made to executives, employees or consultants at a certain price and point in time, and their hedge accounting effects for the corporate tax and social wages and their income tax effects, do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and the related expenses (and their subject impacts in the market value of our assets and liabilities) are not key measures of our core operating performance. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a substitute for Net Income, which is the IFRS measure of earnings. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including our competitors in the technology and financial services industries, because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner as we do, and therefore, our measure may not be comparable to those of other companies. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Second Quarter 2022 &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation For the three-month period ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (In thousands of U.S. Dollars) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) ($ million) Q2'22 Q2'21 Loss Attributable to Shareholders of the Parent Company (29.9) (15.2) Share-based Compensation 59.8 42.5 Allocated Tax Effects on Share-based Compensation (14.2) (10.8) Hedge of the Tax Effects on Share-based Compensation 1.3 0.0 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 17.0 (16.5) &nbsp; FX Neutral measures are prepared and presented to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange, or &ldquo;FX,&rdquo; volatility between the comparison periods, allowing management and investors to evaluate our financial performance despite variations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. FX Neutral measures are presented because our management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of our operating and financial performance, although they are not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. The FX Neutral measures were calculated to present what such measures in preceding periods would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these preceding periods until the date of the Company's most recent financial information. The FX Neutral measures for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and the key business metrics for such period by the average Brazilian reais /U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended June 30, 2021 (R$5.209 to US$1.00) and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended June 30, 2022 (R$4.988 to US$1.00), so as to present what certain of our statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained stable from this past period until the three months ended June 30, 2022. The average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated as the average of the month-end rates for each month in the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 as reported by Bloomberg. FX Neutral measures for deposits and interest-earning portfolio were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts as of June 30, 2021, by the spot Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates as of this date&nbsp; (R$4.970 to US$1.00), and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by using the spot rate as of June 30, 2022 (R$5.257 to US$1.00) so as to present what these amounts would have been had exchange rates been the same as those on June 30, 2021. The Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated using rates as of such dates as reported by Bloomberg. &nbsp; FX Rates - On a monthly basis, Nu translates its subsidiaries figures from their individual functional currency into Nu Holdings functional currency, the U.S. Dollars (&quot;US$&quot;), following the requirements of IAS 21 &quot;The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates&quot;. The functional currency of the Brazilian operating entities is the Brazilian Real (&quot;R$&quot;), of the Mexican entities is the Mexican Peso (&quot;MXN&quot;), and of the Colombian (&quot;COP&quot;) entity is the Colombian Peso.
