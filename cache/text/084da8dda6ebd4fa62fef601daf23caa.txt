In the CIB, IB fees rose 16% as ECM and M&A activity picked up against a supportive backdrop. We continued to benefit from higher client activity and demand for financing in Markets, with record third- quarter Markets revenue of nearly $9 billion. In CCB, we ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits for the fifth consecutive year, and we continue to acquire new accounts at a robust pace, adding more than 400,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. Additionally, in wealth management, first-time investors surpassed 43,000, setting a new record. Finally, in AWM, revenue topped $6 billion, and AUM net inflows remained strong at $109 billion, highlighting the strength of the franchise.” Dimon added: “While there have been some signs of a softening, particularly in job growth, the U.S. economy generally remained resilient. However, there continues to be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation. As always, we hope for the best, but these complex forces reinforce why we prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.” Dimon concluded: “I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, including consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.” CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $4.1 billion or $1.50 per share n $8.0 billion of common stock net repurchases10 n Net payout LTM10,11 of 73% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $124.96, up 9% YoY; tangible book value per share2 of $105.70, up 10% YoY n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $287 billion, Standardized ratio3 of 14.8% and Advanced ratio3 of 14.9% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.8% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n Approximately $2.5 trillion of credit and capital12 raised YTD: n $205 billion of credit for consumers n $25 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $2.2 trillion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $56 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons are for the third quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net interest income excluding Markets2 was $23.4 billion, flat to the prior year, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher revolving balances in Card Services and higher wholesale deposit balances.

Markets revenue was $8.9 billion, up 25%. Noninterest expense was $24.3 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in front office employees, as well as higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing expense, partially offset by lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $ 3.4 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.6 billion, up $506 million, predominantly driven by Wholesale and Card Services.

Net revenue13 was $19.5 billion, up 9%.

Morgan Wealth Management. Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, down 3%, largely driven by lower net interest income.

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year- to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $124.96, $122.51 and $ 115.15 at September 30, 2025 , June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
