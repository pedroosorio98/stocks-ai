Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Underwriting Agreement On June&#160;14, 2021, NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Underwriting Agreement, with Morgan Stanley&#160;&amp; Co. LLC, as representative of the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto, or the Underwriters, to issue and sell $5.0&#160;billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, consisting of $1.25&#160;billion principal amount of 0.309% notes due 2023, or the 2023 Notes, $1.25&#160;billion principal amount of 0.584% notes due 2024, or the 2024 Notes, $1.25&#160;billion principal amount of 1.550% notes due 2028, or the 2028 Notes, and $1.25&#160;billion principal amount of 2.000% notes due 2031, or the 2031 Notes. The 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2031 Notes are collectively referred to as the Notes. The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, conditions and covenants, including an agreement to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $4.98&#160;billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, repayment of indebtedness. The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.&#160;333-237390) and a related prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The above description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference. Indenture The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September&#160;16, 2016, or the Base Indenture, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Trustee, as supplemented by an Officers&#8217; Certificate, dated as of June&#160;16, 2021. The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Officers&#8217; Certificate, is referred to as the Indenture. The 2023 Notes will mature on June&#160;15, 2023, the 2024 Notes will mature on June&#160;14, 2024, the 2028 Notes will mature on June&#160;15, 2028 and the 2031 Notes will mature on June&#160;15, 2031. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable on June&#160;14 and December&#160;14 of each year, beginning on December&#160;14, 2021. Interest on all other series of Notes is payable on June&#160;15 and December&#160;15 of each year, beginning on December&#160;15, 2021. The Company may redeem the Notes for cash in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to maturity, upon at least 10 but no more than 60 days prior notice (other than in certain circumstances), at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of (i)&#160;the 2023 Notes on or after June&#160;15, 2022, (ii) the 2024 Notes on or after June&#160;14, 2023, (iii) the 2028 Notes on or after April&#160;15, 2028, or (iv)&#160;the 2031 Notes on or after March&#160;15, 2031. The Indenture includes covenants limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to create liens on its properties, enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to its properties or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets, subject to a number of important exceptions as specified in the Indenture. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions. In the event of the occurrence of both (1)&#160;a change of control of the Company and (2)&#160;a downgrade of a series of Notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. and S&amp;P Global Ratings within a specified period relating to the applicable change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase any outstanding Notes of that series at a price in cash equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes to be repurchased to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Notes are the Company&#8217;s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally with all of the Company&#8217;s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries and will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes. The above description of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the forms of Notes, attached as Exhibits 4.1 through 4.6 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference.
