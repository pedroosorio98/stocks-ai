"Looking forward to fiscal year 2019, we expect another year of double digit revenue growth. Sustained demand within our semiconductor segment will be augmented by the newly acquired mainframe and enterprise software businesses to our infrastructure software segment. We also expect operating margin to hit another record in fiscal year 2019 driven by improved operating leverage." "Free cash flow from operations grew 50% in fiscal year 2018 to $8.2 billion . As a result, we are raising our target dividend by 51 percent to $2.65 per share per quarter for fiscal year 2019," said Tom Krause , CFO of Broadcom Inc.

Basis of Presentation Broadcom Inc. is the successor to Broadcom Limited for financial reporting purposes effective as of the close of trading on April 4, 2018 . Information provided for fiscal periods beginning with the fiscal quarter ended May 6, 2018 , relates to Broadcom Inc. and for prior fiscal periods relates to Broadcom Limited . Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this press release to " Broadcom ," "the Company," "we," "our," "us" and similar terms are to Broadcom Inc. from and after the effective time of the redomiciliation and, prior to that time, are to our predecessor, Broadcom Limited . The Company's financial results include contributions from Brocade Communication Systems' continuing operations starting in the first fiscal quarter of 2018. The financial results from businesses that have been classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements are not included in the results presented below, unless otherwise stated. Due to the Company's 52/53 week reporting cycle, fiscal year 2018 included an extra week in the first quarter, compared to fiscal year 2017. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to GAAP reporting,&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;provides investors with net revenue, net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenue, and excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, impairment on investment, debt-related costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on acquisition-related assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations and non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.&nbsp;Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. Broadcom&nbsp;believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. About Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc.

Net income attributable to NCI prior to the Redomiciliation represents approximately 5% of net income attributable to LP Units. (2) For the fiscal year ended November 4, 2018 and for each fiscal year 2017 period presented, diluted income per share excluded the potentially dilutive effect of the exchange of LP Units as their effect was antidilutive. There were no LP Units outstanding during the fiscal quarters ended November 4, 2018 and August 5, 2018 due to the Redomiciliation. &nbsp; BROADCOM INC.
