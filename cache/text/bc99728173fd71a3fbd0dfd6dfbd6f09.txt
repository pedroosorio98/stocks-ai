Cayman Islands &nbsp; &nbsp; Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated statements of financial position of Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of March 31, 2025, the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income or loss for the three-month period ended, changes in equity and cash flows for the three-month period then ended, and notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo; issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion on these interim-condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review. &nbsp; Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with Brazilian and International Standards on Review (NBC TR 2410 - Revis&atilde;o de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Intermedi&aacute;rias Executada pelo Auditor da Entidade and ISRE 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity , respectively). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of people responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. &nbsp; &nbsp; KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda., uma sociedade simples brasileira, de responsabilidade limitada e firma-membro da organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o global KPMG de firmas-membro independentes licenciadas da KPMG International Limited, uma empresa inglesa privada de responsabilidade limitada.

The Company&#8217;s shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;) under the symbol &#8220;NU&#8221;. The Company holds investments in several operating entities and, as of March 31, 2025, its significant operating subsidiaries were: &#8226; Nu Pagamentos S.A. - Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamento (&#8220;Nu Pagamentos&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Brazil.

It offers customizable loans with transparent terms and conditions managed via a smartphone app, allowing 24/7 issuance, repayment, and prepayments through NuAccount. Additionally, Nu Financeira issues Bank Deposit Receipts (RDB) to NuAccount holders with daily liquidity and a defined maturity date, and provides credit to Nu Pagamentos credit card holders for overdue invoices and revolving credit. &#8226; Nu Investimentos S.A. - Corretora de T&iacute;tulos e Valores Mobili&aacute;rios (&quot;Nu Investimento&quot;) , previously known as Nu Invest Corretora de Valores S.A. (&quot;Nu Invest&quot;), is an indirect subsidiary acquired in June 2021, domiciled in Brazil, and is a digital investment broker dealer in Brazil. &#8226; Nu M&eacute;xico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P.

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as the &#8220;Group&#8221; or &quot;Nu&#8221;. Nu&#8217;s business plan provides for the continued growth of its Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian operations, both through the expansion of its existing product lines, including, credit card, personal loans, investments, and insurance, as well as the introduction of new products. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption of the Group continuing as a going concern. &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The Company&#8217;s Board authorized the issuance of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements on May 13, 2025. Seasonality The Company's business is affected by customer behavior throughout the year and demonstrates seasonality effects. Historically, Nu benefits from higher purchase volume and related revenue in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. However, Nu's high historical growth has masked this seasonality in the past, and this may become more pronounced in the future. As a result of seasonality fluctuations caused by these and other factors, comparisons of the results of operations across different periods may not be accurate indicators of future performance. As the Company diversify its business across product lines, seasonality may be reduced. 2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards &#8211; Accounting Standards as issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS - Accounting Standards). However, selected condensed explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to understanding the changes in the Group's financial position and performance since the issuance of its last annual financial statements. The Group&#8217;s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) . Accordingly, this unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements is to be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the &quot;Annual Financial Statements&#8221;). a) Functional currency and foreign currency translation i) Nu Holding's functional and presentation currency The presentation of the functional currency and foreign currency translation is described below. The functional currency for Nu Holdings and the presentation currency of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar (&#8220;US$&#8221;). The functional currency of the Brazilian operating entities is the Brazilian real (&quot;BRL&quot;), for the Mexican entities, Mexican peso (&quot;MXN&quot;) and for the Colombian entities, the Colombian peso (&quot;COP&quot;). The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries held in functional currencies that are not US$ are translated into US$, and the exchange differences arising from the translation to US$ of the financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than the US$ are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or loss (OCI) as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss within &#8220;currency translation on foreign entities&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; b) New or revised accounting pronouncements adopted in 2025: The following new or revised standards issued by IASB, were effective for the period covered by these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and had no significant impact. &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1); &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1); &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16); &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7). c) Other new standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective: &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21); &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classification and measurement of financial instruments (Amendments to IFRS 7 and IFRS 9). &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards: &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 1: Hedge accounting by a first-time adopter; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 7: Gain or loss on derecognition; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 7: Disclosure of deferred difference between fair value and transaction price; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 7: Introduction and credit risk disclosures; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 9: Lessee derecognition of lease liabilities; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 9: Transaction price; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFRS 10: Determination of a &#8216;de facto agent&#8217;; &#9702; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IAS 7: Cost method. &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Tax Reform &#8212; Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12). Brazil adopted Pillar Two rules, specifically the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) through enactment of Law n&ordm; 15.079/2024 in December 2024, which is effective as of January 1, 2025. QDMTT determines that a minimum 15% corporate income rate tax should be paid in each jurisdiction in which multinational groups operate. The Group's operations in Brazil and the majority of Brazilian entities have a statutory corporate income tax rate of 40%, which exceeds the QDMTT standards, therefore no impact of Pillar Two is expected. There are no impacts related to Pillar Two for the other consolidated companies under Nu Holdings structure. Management does not expect the adoption of the amendments described above to have a significant impact, other than additional disclosures, on the Group's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements (IFRS 18): &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The new standard replaces IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and determines a new structure for the income statement by categorizing it into predefined sections: operating, investing, financing, discontinued operations, and income tax. It also requires the disclosure of management-defined performance measures (MPMs) in a single note within the financial statements. These amendments will take effect on January 1, 2027. The Group is reviewing the impacts of the new standard. 3. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounting balances of Nu Holdings and all those subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, directly or indirectly. Control is achieved where the Company has (i) power over the investee; (ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) can use its power to affect its profits. The Company re-assesses whether it maintains control of an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three above mentioned elements of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over it and ceases when the Company loses control over it. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the consolidated statements of profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. The financial information of the subsidiaries was prepared for the same period as the Company and consistent accounting policies were applied. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Company. Accordingly, all balances, transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising between consolidated entities are eliminated in the consolidation, except for foreign-currency gain and losses on translation of intercompany loans. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, when applicable. The subsidiaries below are the most relevant entities included in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements: Entity &nbsp; Control &nbsp; Principal activities &nbsp; Functional currency &nbsp; Country &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 Nu Pagamentos S.A. - Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamentos (&#8220;Nu Pagamentos&#8221;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Credit card and prepaid account operations &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; &#9;100%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;100%&#9; Nu Financeira S.A. &#8211; SCFI (&#8220;Nu Financeira&#8221;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Loan operations &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; &#9;100%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;100%&#9; Nu Investimentos S.A. - Corretora de T&iacute;tulos e Valores Mobili&aacute;rios (&quot;Nu Investimentos&quot;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Investment platform &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; &#9;100%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;100%&#9; Nu M&eacute;xico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, the Company consolidated investment funds as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, in which the Group&#8217;s companies hold a substantial interest or the entirety of the interests and are therefore exposed, or have rights, to variable returns and have the ability to affect those returns through power over the funds. 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements and therefore should be read in conjunction. 5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires judgments, estimates, and assumptions from management that affect the application of accounting policies, and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to the estimates are recognized prospectively. The significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were the same as those adopted in the Annual Financial Statements. Credit losses on financial instruments for credit card receivables and loans to customers The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on credit cards receivables and loans to customers that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of allowance as of each reporting date. Management performs an analysis of the credit card and loan amounts to determine if credit losses have occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. Key areas of judgment The critical judgments made by management in applying the expected credit losses (&quot;ECL&quot;) allowance methodology are: a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The macroeconomic information used to gauge the determination of the probability weights to be given in the different macroeconomic scenarios and the respective weights; b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of default; c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of significant increase in credit risk and credit card lifetime; and d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look-back period, used for parameters estimation (probability of default - PD, exposure at default - EAD and loss given default - LGD). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; Sensitivity analysis On March 31, 2025, the ECL allowance for credit card receivables and loans to customers totaled US$3,798,728, of which US$2,763,324 related to credit card receivables and US$1,035,404 to loans to customers. The ECL allowance is sensitive to the methodology, assumptions and estimations underlying its calculation. One key assumption is the probability weighting of the macroeconomic scenarios between upside, base and downside as the carrying amount of the credit loss allowance is determined based on the weighted average of these scenarios. Such weightings reflect management's perception around the current and future expectations of the macroeconomic environment in each of the geographies the Group operates. The table below illustrates the ECL based on the weighted average of these three macroeconomic scenarios and the ECL that would have arisen if management had applied a 100% weighting to each macroeconomic scenario. &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighted average &nbsp; Upside &nbsp; Base case &nbsp; Downside &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card and loan ECL &nbsp; &#9;3,798,728&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,525,008&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,740,897&#9; &nbsp; &#9;4,118,555&#9; 6.

The effects of the potentially dilutive instruments were calculated using the treasury stock method and are included in the total weighted average of ordinary outstanding shares for diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) if the effects are considered dilutive. The antidilutive instruments not considered in the weighted number of shares correspond to the total number of shares that could be converted into ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of those instruments. Instruments are considered antidilutive if the average market value of ordinary shares during the period is less than the average value of the assumed proceeds (fair value of services that will be recognized as a cost in future periods plus exercise price multiplied by the number of options and shares to be issued on exercise of the options). 10. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Share-settled awards The Group&#8217;s employee incentives include share settled awards in the form of stock, offering them the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares by exercising options (Stock Options &#8211; &#8220;SOPs&#8221;), receiving ordinary shares (Restricted Stock Units &#8211; &#8220;RSUs&#8221;) upon vesting, and receiving shares upon the achievement of market conditions and passage of time (&quot;Awards&quot;). The cost of the employee services received with respect to those share-based compensation payments is recognized in the statement of income over the period that the employee provides services and according to the vesting conditions. The Group also issued Awards in 2020 that grant shares upon the achievement of market conditions related to the valuation of the Company. RSUs incentive was implemented in 2020 and is the main incentive since then. There were no changes to the terms and conditions of the SOPs and RSUs after the grant date. The changes in the number of SOPs and RSUs are as follows. WAEP is the weighted average exercise price and WAGDFV is the weighted average fair value at the grant date.

Credit card receivables can be paid by Nu's customers in up to 36 monthly installments. The cardholder&#8217;s credit limit is initially reduced by the total amount and the installments become due and payable on the cardholder's subsequent monthly credit card statement. Brazil makes the corresponding payments to the credit card network (see note 23) following a similar schedule. As receipts and payments are aligned, the Group does not incur significant financing costs with this product, however it is exposed to the credit risk of the cardholder as it is obliged to make the payments to the credit card network even if the cardholder does not pay. &#8220;Receivables - installments&#8221; also includes the amounts of credit card bills not fully paid by the customers and that have been converted into payments in installments with a fixed interest rate (&quot;fatura parcelada&quot;), in addition to bill financing, which comprise bills paid in installments through the credit card, banking payment slips (&quot;boleto&quot;) and PIX financing in more than one installment. &nbsp; (ii) &quot;Receivables - revolving&quot; is related to the amounts due from customers that have not paid or fully paid their credit card bill. Customers may request to convert these receivables into loans to be paid in installments. In accordance with Brazilian regulation, revolving balances in Brazil that have not been fully paid and that are outstanding for more than 2 months are mandatory converted into fatura parcelada - a type of installment loan which is settled through the customer&#8217;s monthly credit card bills . &nbsp; &nbsp; 27 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, and is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, which is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. The explanation of each stage is set out in the Company's accounting policies, as disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements. &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; Gross Exposures &nbsp; % &nbsp; Credit Loss Allowance &nbsp; % &nbsp; Coverage Ratio &nbsp; Gross Exposures &nbsp; % &nbsp; Credit Loss Allowance &nbsp; % &nbsp; Coverage Ratio Stage 1 &#9;6,102,998&#9; &nbsp; 77.8%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;275,383&#9; &nbsp; 26.6%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;4.5% &nbsp; &#9;4,728,358&#9; &nbsp; 77.3%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;239,306&#9; &nbsp; 30.1%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;5.1% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 2 &#9;1,289,110&#9; &nbsp; 16.4%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;461,212&#9; &nbsp; 44.5%&#9; &nbsp; 35.8%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,054,416&#9; &nbsp; 17.2%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;325,020&#9; &nbsp; 40.9%&#9; &nbsp; 30.8%&#9; Absolute Trigger (Days Late) &#9;242,992&#9; &nbsp; 18.8%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;192,457&#9; &nbsp; 41.7%&#9; &nbsp; 79.2%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;180,780&#9; &nbsp; 17.1%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;150,723&#9; &nbsp; 46.4%&#9; &nbsp; 83.4%&#9; Relative Trigger (PD deterioration) &#9;1,046,118&#9; &nbsp; 81.2%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;268,755&#9; &nbsp; 58.3%&#9; &nbsp; 25.7%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;873,636&#9; &nbsp; 82.9%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;174,297&#9; &nbsp; 53.6%&#9; &nbsp; 20.0%&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 3 &#9;455,952&#9; &nbsp; 5.8%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;298,809&#9; &nbsp; 28.9%&#9; &nbsp; 65.5%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;333,681&#9; &nbsp; &#9;5.5% &nbsp; &#9;230,244&#9; &nbsp; 29.0%&#9; &nbsp; 69.0%&#9; Total &#9;7,848,060&#9; &nbsp; 100.0%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,035,404&#9; &nbsp; 100.0%&#9; &nbsp; 13.2%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;6,116,455&#9; &nbsp; 100.0%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;794,570&#9; &nbsp; 100.0%&#9; &nbsp; 13.0%&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; 34 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group executes transactions with derivative financial instruments, which are intended to meet its own needs to reduce its exposure to market, currency and interest-rate risks. The derivatives are classified at fair value through profit or loss, except those in cash flow hedge accounting strategies, for which the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives is recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Management of these risks is conducted through determining limits, and the establishment of operating strategies. The derivative contracts are considered level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are used to hedge exposures, but hedge accounting is adopted only for forecasted transactions related to the cloud infrastructure, intercompany transactions and certain software licenses used by Nu (hedge of foreign currency risk), to hedge interest of the fixed rate credit portfolio (hedge of interest rate risk of portfolio) and to hedge the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting or SOP exercise, as shown below. &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair values &nbsp; Notional amount &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; Liabilities Derivatives classified at fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest rate contracts &#8211; Futures &#9;199,433&#9; &nbsp; &#9;2&#9; &nbsp; &#9;383&#9; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts &#8211; Futures &#9;745,692&#9; &nbsp; &#9;168&#9; &nbsp; &#9;5,716&#9; Interest rate contracts &#8211; Swaps &#9;111,268&#9; &nbsp; &#9;2,818&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts - Non-deliverable forwards (NDF) &#9;62,650&#9; &nbsp; &#9;56&#9; &nbsp; &#9;992&#9; Warrants &#9;23,671&#9; &nbsp; &#9;22,046&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Call Options &#9;27,000&#9; &nbsp; &#9;24,140&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts &#8211; Deliverable forwards (DF) &#9;19,140&#9; &nbsp; &#9;81&#9; &nbsp; &#9;79&#9; Interest rate contracts - Deliverable forwards (DF) &#9;441,088&#9; &nbsp; &#9;77,356&#9; &nbsp; &#9;77,306&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivatives held for hedging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Designated as cash flow hedge &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts &#8211; Futures &#9;132,131&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,069&#9; Equity - Total Return Swap (TRS) &#9;70,211&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;13,216&#9; Total &#9;1,832,284&#9; &nbsp; &#9;126,667&#9; &nbsp; &#9;98,761&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair values &nbsp; Notional amount &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; Liabilities Derivatives classified at fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest rate contracts - Futures &#9;347,110&#9; &nbsp; &#9;158&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts &#8211; Futures &#9;701,367&#9; &nbsp; &#9;61&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,990&#9; Interest rate contracts &#8211; Swaps &#9;308,176&#9; &nbsp; &#9;19,808&#9; &nbsp; &#9;78&#9; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts - Non-deliverable forwards (NDF) &#9;483,493&#9; &nbsp; &#9;4,772&#9; &nbsp; &#9;16,169&#9; Warrants &#9;23,645&#9; &nbsp; &#9;23,665&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Call Options &#9;27,000&#9; &nbsp; &#9;27,000&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivatives held for hedging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Designated as cash flow hedge &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Foreign currency exchange rate contracts &#8211; Futures &#9;164,752&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;510&#9; Equity - Total Return Swap (TRS) &#9;111,479&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;13,582&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &#9;2,167,022&#9; &nbsp; &#9;75,464&#9; &nbsp; &#9;32,329&#9; Futures contracts are traded on the B3 ( Brasil, Bolsa e Balc&atilde;o ), a stock exchange in Brazil, as the counterparty and are settled on a daily basis.

The Group managed its exposures to the variability in cash flows of foreign currency forecasted transactions to movements in foreign exchange rates by entering into foreign currency exchange rate contracts (exchange futures). These instruments are entered into to match the cash flow profile of the estimated forecast transactions and are exchange-traded with fair value movements settled on a daily basis. &nbsp; &nbsp; 44 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The Group applies hedge accounting to the forecasted transactions related to its main cloud infrastructure contract and other expenses in foreign currency including intercompany expenses. The effectiveness is assessed monthly by analyzing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the amount of the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. Derivatives are generally rolled over monthly. They are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedged item. Therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transaction have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective. Sources of ineffectiveness are differences in the amount and timing of forecast and actual payment of expenses. The table below shows the change in the hedge of foreign currency risk: &nbsp; Three-month period ended &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 03/31/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &#9;11,721&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(8,254) Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &#9;12,434&#9; &nbsp; &#9;86,466&#9; Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period &#9;(34,222) &nbsp; &#9;6,811&#9; to &quot;Customer support and operation&quot; &#9;3,524&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,199&#9; to &quot;General and administrative expenses&quot; &#9;(10,873) &nbsp; &#9;636&#9; to &quot;Other income (expenses)&quot; &#9;(17,961) &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &#9;(8,912) &nbsp; &#9;2,976&#9; Deferred income taxes &#9;4,923&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(3,308) Balance at end of the period &#9;(5,144) &nbsp; &#9;81,715&#9; The expected future transactions that are the hedged item are: &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; Up to 3 months &nbsp; 3 to 12 months &nbsp; Total &nbsp; Total Expected foreign currency transactions &#9;66,305&#9; &nbsp; &#9;89,169&#9; &nbsp; &#9;155,474&#9; &nbsp; &#9;187,456&#9; Total &#9;66,305&#9; &nbsp; &#9;89,169&#9; &nbsp; &#9;155,474&#9; &nbsp; &#9;187,456&#9; b) Hedge of corporate and social security taxes over share-based compensation The Group's hedge strategy is to cover the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting from the variation of the Company's share price volatility. The derivative financial instruments used to cover the exposure are total return swaps (&quot;TRS&quot;) in which one leg is indexed to the Company's stock price and the other leg is indexed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&quot;SOFR&quot;) plus spread. The stock fixed at the TRS is a weighted average price. The hedge was entered into by Nu Holdings and therefore there is no income tax effect. &nbsp; &nbsp; 45 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The Group applies the cash flow hedge for the hedge structure thus the market risk is replaced by an interest rate risk. The effectiveness assessment is performed monthly by (i) assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) monitoring the credit risk impact in the hedge effectiveness; and (iii) maintaining and updating the hedging ratio. Given the possibility of forfeiture impacting the future cash forecast of the employee benefit plan, the Group manages exposures to keep the hedging level within an acceptable coverage.

In Brazil, NuAccount is a prepaid account in which the amounts deposited by customers are classified as electronic money and must be allocated to government securities (see note 12b) or in a specific account maintained at the Central Bank of Brazil (see note 15), in accordance with Brazilian regulatory requirements. In Mexico, NuAccount balances are not required to be invested in specific assets; and therefore, they can be used as a financing source for the credit card operations in Mexico. In Colombia, NuAccount balances are required to have a percentage of the deposits from the public in an account with the Colombian Central Bank, also a percentage of the deposits as required to be invested in a class of compulsory deposits. RDBs are investment products available within NuAccount and can have daily liquidity or defined future maturity. Deposits in RDB have guarantees from the Brazilian Deposit Guarantee Fund (&#8220;FGC&#8221;). Unlike the deposits in electronic money, Nu is required to follow the compulsory deposits requirements for RDB deposits (see note 15). However, it is not required to invest the remaining resources in government securities or in a specific account maintained at the Central Bank of Brazil. As such,these amounts can be used as a financing source for loan and credit card operations. The interest paid on both NuAccount and RDB deposits (except fixed term RDBs) is 100% of the Brazilian CDI rate as of the initial date if the balances are kept for more than 30 days. There are also RDBs with a defined future maturity date, which have a maturity of up to 27 months and a weighted average interest rate of 104% of the Brazilian CDI rate as of March 31, 2025 (as of December 31, 2024, the weighted average interest rate was 105% of the Brazilian CDI rate). &nbsp; For NuAccount in Mexico, the balances deposited in &quot;Cajitas&quot; yield from 12.0% to 14.0% per year as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. &quot;Cajitas&quot; has daily yield accrual and can have daily liquidity or defined future maturity.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The main valuation techniques employed in internal models to measure the fair value of the financial instruments as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 are set out below. The principal inputs into these models are derived from observable market data. The Group did not make any material changes to its valuation techniques and internal models in those periods. a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost The following tables show the fair value of the financial instruments carried at amortized cost as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments such as compulsory and other deposits at central banks, other receivables, other financial assets at amortized cost, deposits in electronic money and RDB because the carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; Carrying amount &nbsp; Fair value &nbsp; Carrying amount &nbsp; Fair value &nbsp; &nbsp; Level 1 &nbsp; Level 2 &nbsp; Level 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Level 1 &nbsp; Level 2 &nbsp; Level 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card receivables &#9;13,540,738&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;14,615,577&#9; &nbsp; &#9;12,259,276&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;13,188,240&#9; Loans to customers &#9;6,812,656&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;7,181,107&#9; &nbsp; &#9;5,321,885&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;5,639,873&#9; Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &#9;7,375,537&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9;6,743,336&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other receivables &#9;887,630&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9;1,413,443&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other financial assets &#9;107,371&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9;78,147&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &#9;881,218&#9; &nbsp; &#9;251,905&#9; &nbsp; &#9;618,353&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;885,418&#9; &nbsp; &#9;544,845&#9; &nbsp; &#9;330,745&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Total &#9;29,605,150&#9; &nbsp; &#9;251,905&#9; &nbsp; &#9;618,353&#9; &nbsp; &#9;21,796,684&#9; &nbsp; &#9;26,701,505&#9; &nbsp; &#9;544,845&#9; &nbsp; &#9;330,745&#9; &nbsp; &#9;18,828,113&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deposits in electronic money &#9;8,223,021&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9;6,796,826&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bank receipt of deposits (RDB) &#9;22,789,393&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9;21,511,844&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bank certificate of deposit (CDB) &#9;551,951&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;551,282&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;546,395&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;545,474&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Payables to network &#9;10,032,529&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,367,931&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,333,541&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;8,693,972&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Borrowings and financing (i) &#9;1,706,895&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,713,854&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,730,357&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,737,303&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Total &#9;43,303,789&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;11,633,067&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;39,918,963&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;10,976,749&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Borrowings and financing include the fair value calculated by the discounted cash flow method and also in cases in which the fair value is the same amount as the book value (cases with prepayment clauses at the amortized cost). The fair value of floating rate demand deposits is assumed to be equal to carrying amounts. The valuation approach to specific categories of financial instruments is described below. &nbsp; &nbsp; 54 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; i) Fair value models and inputs Credit card: The fair values of credit card receivables and payables to the network are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Fair values are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and credit spread. For payables, cash flows are also discounted by the Group's own credit spread. Loans to customers: Fair value is estimated based on groups of customers with similar risk profiles, using valuation models. The fair value of a loan is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. Other receivables: Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. b) Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value The following table shows a summary of the fair values, as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, of the financial assets and liabilities indicated below, classified on the basis of the various measurement methods used by the Group to determine their fair value: &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; Fair value Level 1 &nbsp; Fair value Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value Level 3 &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Investment funds &#9;366,340&#9; &nbsp; &#9;260,012&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;626,352&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Government bonds &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazil &#9;7,935,068&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;7,935,068&#9; United States of America &#9;161,165&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;161,165&#9; Mexico &#9;518,678&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;518,678&#9; Colombia &#9;57,148&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;57,148&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corporate bonds and other instruments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certificate of bank deposits (CDB) &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,156&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,156&#9; Investment funds &#9;8,707&#9; &nbsp; &#9;17,634&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;26,341&#9; Time deposit &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;286,523&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;286,523&#9; Notes &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;50,134&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;50,134&#9; Bill of credit (LC) &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;2&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;2&#9; Real estate and agribusiness certificate of receivables &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,068&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,068&#9; Real estate and agribusiness letter of credit &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;521&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;521&#9; Corporate bonds and debentures &#9;1,095,278&#9; &nbsp; &#9;81,600&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,176,878&#9; Equity instrument &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;12,917&#9; &nbsp; &#9;12,917&#9; Derivative financial instruments &#9;170&#9; &nbsp; &#9;80,230&#9; &nbsp; &#9;46,267&#9; &nbsp; &#9;126,667&#9; Collateral for credit card operations &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;340&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;340&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &#9;7,168&#9; &nbsp; &#9;91,593&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;98,761&#9; Repurchase agreements &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;486,760&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;486,760&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; 55 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Therefore, all government bonds and some corporate bonds are included in level 1 as they are traded in active markets. Brazilian securities fair values are the published prices by the &quot; Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais &quot; (&quot;Anbima&quot;). For US, Mexico and Colombia bonds, fair values are the published prices by Bloomberg, Valmer and Precia, respectively. Other corporate bonds and investment fund shares, to which fair values are calculated based on observable data, such as interest rates and interest rate curves are classified as level 2. Credit Rights Investment Funds (&#8220;FIDCs&#8221;), a type of Investment fund comprised of fixed rate receivables from retail customers are classified at level 3 of the fair value hierarchy with fair value calculated using the discounted cash flow model, based on the underlying assets of the fund. Derivatives: Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified as level 1 of the hierarchy. Derivatives traded on the Brazilian stock exchange are fairly valued using B3 quotations. Swaps are valued by discounting future expected cash flows to present values using interest rate curves and are classified as level 2. Total Return Swaps are also valued by discounting expected cash flows, with the particularity that the equity leg expected cash flow is the last observed price, following non-arbitrage principles. Call options and Warrants are valued using internal models, hence classified as level 3. Equity instrument: For the fair value of the equity instrument, the Group used contractual conditions as inputs that are not directly observable, and therefore it is classified as level 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; 56 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; Repurchase agreements: The fair value is calculated by utilizing discounted cash flow. c) Reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 The table below shows a reconciliation from the opening to the closing balances for recurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; Equity instrument &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Financial assets at beginning of period &#9;12,900&#9; &nbsp; &#9;50,665&#9; &nbsp; &#9;63,565&#9; Acquisitions &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; &nbsp; &#9;-&#9; Total gains or losses &#9;17&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(4,398) &nbsp; &#9;(4,381) In profit or loss &#9;17&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(4,398) &nbsp; &#9;(4,381) Financial assets at end of period &#9;12,917&#9; &nbsp; &#9;46,267&#9; &nbsp; &#9;59,184&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2024 &nbsp; Equity instrument &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; Investment funds &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Financial assets at beginning of period &#9;13,199&#9; &nbsp; &#9;20&#9; &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;13,219&#9; Acquisitions &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;70,609&#9; &nbsp; &#9;70,609&#9; Total gains or losses &#9;(24) &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(976) &nbsp; &#9;(1,000) In profit or loss &#9;(24) &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;151&#9; &nbsp; &#9;127&#9; In OCI &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(1,127) &nbsp; &#9;(1,127) Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(544) &nbsp; &#9;(544) Financial assets at end of period &#9;13,175&#9; &nbsp; &#9;20&#9; &nbsp; &#9;69,089&#9; &nbsp; &#9;82,284&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no material transfers of financial instruments between levels 1 and 2 or between levels 2 and 3. 30. INCOME TAX Current and deferred taxes are determined for all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the current tax laws. The current income tax expense or benefit represents the estimated taxes to be paid or refunded, respectively, for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary tax differences and tax loss carryforward are expected to reverse. &nbsp; &nbsp; 57 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Income tax reconciliation The tax on the Group's pre-tax profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities. Thus, the following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to profit for the period, calculated by applying the combined Brazilian income tax rate of 40% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. &nbsp; Three-month period ended &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 03/31/2024 Profit before income tax &#9;795,073 &nbsp; &#9;578,537 Tax rate (i) &#9;40%&#9; &nbsp; &#9;40%&#9; Income tax &#9;(318,029) &nbsp; &#9;(231,415) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Permanent additions/exclusions &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Share-based payments &#9;1,350 &nbsp; &#9;(4,566) Operational losses and others &#9;(126) &nbsp; &#9;(3,422) Effect of different tax rates - subsidiaries and parent company &#9;24,496 &nbsp; &#9;8,332 Interest on capital &#9;20,386 &nbsp; &#9;12,845 Other amounts (ii) &#9;34,058 &nbsp; &#9;18,503 Income tax &#9;(237,865) &nbsp; &#9;(199,723) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current tax expense &#9;(81,114) &nbsp; &#9;(415,042) Deferred tax benefit &#9;(156,751) &nbsp; &#9;215,319 Income tax in the statement of profit or loss &#9;(237,865) &nbsp; &#9;(199,723) Deferred tax recognized in OCI &#9;812 &nbsp; &#9;(4,847) (i) The tax rate used was the one applicable to the Brazilian financial subsidiaries, which represents the most significant portion of the operations of the Group. The tax rate used is not materially different from the average effective tax rate considering all jurisdictions where the Group has operations. The effect of other tax rates is shown in the table above as &#8220;effect of different tax rates &#8211; subsidiaries and parent company&#8221;. (ii) Primarily related to the amount of non-taxable income, incentives and non-taxable interests on recoverable taxes. &nbsp; &nbsp; 58 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; b) Deferred income taxes The following tables present significant components of the Group&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the changes for both periods. The accounting records of deferred tax assets on income tax losses and/or social contribution loss carryforwards, as well as those arising from timing differences, are based on technical feasibility studies which consider the expected generation of future taxable income, considering the history of profitability for each subsidiary individually.

During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the following shares were withheld: &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 03/31/2024 Number of shares withheld - RSU &#9;2,002,992&#9; &nbsp; &#9;2,253,602&#9; Total value of shares withheld - RSU &#9;21,292&#9; &nbsp; &#9;18,335&#9; e) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) Other comprehensive income (loss) includes the amounts, net of the related tax effect, of the adjustments to assets and liabilities recognized in equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income that may be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss is related to cash flow hedges that qualify as effective hedges and currency translation that represents the cumulative gains and losses on the retranslation of the Group&#8217;s investment in foreign operations. These amounts will remain under this heading until they are recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the periods in which the hedged items affect it, for example, in the case of the cash flow hedge. The own credit reserve reflects the cumulative own credit gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value. Amounts in the own credit reserve are not reclassified to profit or loss in future periods. &nbsp; &nbsp; 62 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND OTHER RISKS a) Overview The Group monitors all the risks that could have a material impact on its strategic objectives, including those that must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To efficiently manage and mitigate these risks, the risk management structure conducts risk identification and assessment to prioritize the risks that are key when pursuing potential opportunities and/or that may prevent value from being created or that may compromise existing value, with the possibility of impacting financial results, capital, liquidity, customer relationships and reputation. b) Risk management structure Nu considers Risk Management an important pillar of the Group's strategic management. The risk management structure broadly permeates the entire Group, with the objective of ensuring that risks are properly identified, measured, mitigated, monitored, and reported, to support the development of its activities. Risk Management is related to the principles, culture, structures, and processes to improve the decision-making process and the achievement of strategic objectives. It is a continuous and evolving process that is embedded in Nu's entire strategy, to support Management in minimizing its losses, as well as maximizing its profits and underscoring the Group's values. The Group's risk management structure considers the size and complexity of its business, which allows tracking, monitoring, and control of the risks to which it is exposed. The risk management process is aligned with management guidelines, which, through committees and other internal meetings, define strategic objectives, including risk appetite. Conversely, the capital control and capital management units provide support through risk and capital monitoring and analysis processes. The Group considers a risk appetite statement (&#8220;RAS&#8221;) to be an essential instrument to support risk management and decision making. The Board of Directors reviews and approves the RAS, as guidelines and limits for the business plan and capital deployment. Nu has defined a RAS (aligned to local regulatory requirements) that prioritizes the main risks and, for each of these, qualitative statements and quantitative metrics expressed in relation to earnings, capital, risk measures, liquidity and other relevant measures were implemented, as appropriate. c) Risks actively monitored Risks that are actively monitored by the Group include Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB), Foreign exchange (FX), Operational, IT and Cyber, Regulatory, Compliance and AML (Anti-money laundering), Reputational Risk and Risk from Cryptocurrency business. The management of these risks is carried out according to the three-line model, considering policies and procedures in place, as well as the limits established in the RAS. Also, there is a Stress Testing program in place. Each of the risks described below has its own methodologies, systems and processes for its identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, control, and mitigation. &nbsp; &nbsp; 63 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of financial risks, such as credit, liquidity, IRRBB and market risk, the measurement is carried out based on quantitative models and, in certain cases, prospective scenarios in relation to the main variables involved, respecting the applicable regulatory requirements and best market practices. Non-financial risks, such as operational risk and technological/cyber risks, are measured using impact criteria (inherent risk), considering potential financial losses, reputational damage, customer perception and legal/regulatory obligations, as well as evaluated in relation to the effectiveness of the respective structure of internal controls. There were no significant changes to the risk management structure that was reported in Annual Financial Statements. Credit risk The Group&#8217;s outstanding balance of financial assets and other exposures to credit risk is shown in the table below: &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Financial assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &#9;10,284,007&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,185,742&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &#9;335,846&#9; &nbsp; &#9;665,242&#9; Derivative financial instruments &#9;126,667&#9; &nbsp; &#9;75,464&#9; Collateral for credit card operations &#9;340&#9; &nbsp; &#9;336&#9; Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss &#9;462,853&#9; &nbsp; &#9;741,042&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &#9;9,901,753&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,913,517&#9; Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income &#9;9,901,753&#9; &nbsp; &#9;9,913,517&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card receivables &#9;13,540,738&#9; &nbsp; &#9;12,259,276&#9; Loans to customers &#9;6,812,656&#9; &nbsp; &#9;5,321,885&#9; Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &#9;7,375,537&#9; &nbsp; &#9;6,743,336&#9; Other receivables &#9;887,630&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,413,443&#9; Other financial assets &#9;107,371&#9; &nbsp; &#9;78,147&#9; Securities &#9;881,218&#9; &nbsp; &#9;885,418&#9; Financial assets at amortized cost &#9;29,605,150&#9; &nbsp; &#9;26,701,505&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other exposures &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unused limits (i) &#9;20,486,013&#9; &nbsp; &#9;17,663,606&#9; Credit Commitments &#9;20,486,013&#9; &nbsp; &#9;17,663,606&#9; (i) Unused limits are not recorded in the statement of financial position but are considered in the measurement of the ECL because it represents credit risk exposure. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as: &#8226; the ability of an entity to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses; and &#8226; the possibility of not being able to easily exit a financial position due to its size compared to the traded volume in the market. &nbsp; &nbsp; 64 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The liquidity risk management structure uses future cash flow data, applying what Nu believes to be a severe stress scenario to these cash flows, to measure whether the volume of high-quality liquid assets that the Group holds is sufficient to guarantee its resilience. The liquidity indicators are monitored daily, using procedures approved by Management, and compared with the approved limit structure, in accordance with the Group's declared appetite. Among the main liquidity indicators, Nu uses: &#8226; Short-Term Liquidity Ratio : the Group uses an internal methodology which measures whether it holds sufficient high quality liquid assets to cover short term (unexpected) outflows in a severe stress scenario. &#8226; Funding Ratios and Gaps : to guarantee long term Balance Sheet stability, the Group establishes conservative limits for the ratios and cumulative gaps (the value difference) between assets and liabilities in all future maturity buckets, using expected behavioral maturities, calculated with historical internal data. The Group has a detailed Contingency Funding Plan for each entity, describing management actions that must be taken in the event of a deterioration of the liquidity indicators.

(ii) Considering the earliest date in which the customer can withdraw the deposit. The expected redemption rate for Nu's deposits, used within the previously described liquidity risk management framework is estimated based on observed historic customer behavior. (iii) The total was projected considering the exchange rate of Brazilian Reais, Mexican and Colombian Pesos to US$ as of March 31, 2025. The unused limit of credit cards is the pre-approved limit that has not yet been used by the customer and represents the current maximum potential credit exposure. Therefore, it does not represent the real need for liquidity arising from commitments. When customers begin utilizing their unused limits, the duration of the credit card receivables are expected to be shorter than the duration of the payables to network. In view of the asset allocation profile presented above, the Group establishes a funding plan with the aim of maintaining a healthy financial position in the short and long term. The main source of funding is the deposit franchise (Deposits in electronic money and Bank receipt of deposits), which the Group aims to match with a liquidity cushion on the asset side. Securities are mainly composed of Government Bonds, which may have longer maturities (as demonstrated in the table above), but are traded in a market that has historically had high liquidity. Additionally, despite being contractually redeemable in the short term, the Group considers deposits balance to be a growing financing instrument, used alongside with other debt issuances to guarantee a proper mix of funding sources. The Group monitors and utilizes this information as part of its mechanism for managing liquidity risk. Market risk and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) The table below presents the Value at Risk (VaR) calculated using a confidence level of 99% and a holding period of 10 days. The calculation is performed using a filtered historical simulation approach, based on a 5-year historical window. For Brazil VaR is calculated only for the Trading Book, while in Mexico it is presented for the whole Available for Sale portfolio, in line with regulation and portfolio management strategies.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The following analysis presents the Group's sensitivity of the fair value to an increase of 1 basis point (&#8220;bp&#8221;) (DV01) in the Brazilian risk-free curve, Brazilian IPCA coupon curve, US risk-free curve and Mexican risk-free curve, assuming a parallel shift and a constant financial position: DV01 &nbsp; 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazilian risk-free curve &nbsp; &#9;(526) &nbsp; &#9;(363) Brazilian IPCA coupon &nbsp; &#9;(1) &nbsp; &#9;&#8212;&#9; US risk-free curve &nbsp; &#9;(158) &nbsp; &#9;(155) Mexican risk-free curve &nbsp; &#9;5&#9; &nbsp; &#9;(14) Colombia risk-free curve &nbsp; &#9;(44) &nbsp; &#9;(53) Foreign exchange (FX) risk The financial information may exhibit volatility due to the Group&#8217;s operations in foreign currencies, such as the Brazilian Real and the Mexican and Colombian Pesos. At the Nu Holdings level, there is no net investment hedge for investments in other countries. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 , none of the entities of the Group had significant unhedged financial instruments in a currency other than their respective functional currencies. Certain costs in US$ and Euros, or intercompany loans in US$, are hedged with FX derivatives based on projections of these costs, or when there are new exposures. Hedge transactions are adjusted when internal cost projections change and when the FX derivatives expire. The functional currency of the entities in Brazil is the Brazilian Real. Certain costs in US$ and Euros, or intercompany loans in US$, are hedged with futures contracts, traded on the B3 exchange, based on projections of these costs, or when there are new exposures. Hedge transactions are adjusted when internal cost projections change and when the FX derivatives expire. As a result, the consolidated financial statements have no significant exposures to exchange rates after the hedge transactions take effect. 33. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The purpose of capital management is to maintain the capital adequacy for Nu's operation through control and monitoring of the capital position, to evaluate the capital necessity according to the risk appetite and strategic aim of the organization, and to establish a capital planning process following future requirements of regulatory capital, based on the Group's growth projections, risk exposure, market movements, and other relevant information. Also, the capital management structure is responsible for identifying sources of capital, writing and submitting the capital plan and the capital contingency plan for approval by the Executive Directors. Regulatory Capital Composition a) Nu Prudential Conglomerate in Brazil Brazil's Central bank defines a prudential conglomerate as a group of companies in which one regulated entity controls other regulated companies or investment funds. The conglomerate is classified as Type 3 when the regulated company that leads the conglomerate is a Payment Institution, which is the case of Nu Pagamentos. &nbsp; &nbsp; 67 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; The regulatory capital of the prudential conglomerate, defined by Brazil's Central Bank, consists of three key components: &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: Consisting of paid-in capital, reserves, and retained earnings, after accounting for deductions and prudential adjustments. &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital: This includes debt instruments that have no specific maturity and can absorb losses, meeting the eligibility criteria set out by the Central Bank. The sum of CET1 and AT1 forms the overall Tier 1 Capital. &#8226; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tier II Capital: This involves subordinated debt instruments with set maturity dates that meet eligibility requirements. Type 3 institutions are required to implement capital rules as a prudential conglomerate. This implementation involved a phase-in period for minimum capital requirements and prudential adjustments, extending until December 2024. As of January 2025, Nu is now operating under the full requirements. The following table presents the calculated capital ratios for the CET1, Tier 1, and the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and outlines their minimum requirements for the prudential conglomerate under Brazil's current regulations: Prudential conglomerate 03/31/2025 &nbsp; 12/31/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regulatory Capital &#9;4,001,268&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,629,737&#9; Tier I &#9;3,591,068&#9; &nbsp; &#9;3,250,052&#9; Common equity capital &#9;3,273,736&#9; &nbsp; &#9;2,940,941&#9; Additional &#9;317,332&#9; &nbsp; &#9;309,111&#9; Tier II &#9;410,200&#9; &nbsp; &#9;379,685&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Risk weighted assets (RWA) &#9;23,736,870&#9; &nbsp; &#9;20,071,878&#9; Credit risk (RWA CPAD) &#9;16,684,543&#9; &nbsp; &#9;14,771,860&#9; Market risk (RWA MPAD) &#9;175,505&#9; &nbsp; &#9;46,080&#9; Operational risk (RWA OPAD) &#9;5,547,379&#9; &nbsp; &#9;4,506,187&#9; Payment services risk (RWA SP) &#9;1,329,443&#9; &nbsp; &#9;747,751&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minimum capital required &#9;2,492,371&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,756,289&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excess margin &#9;1,508,897&#9; &nbsp; &#9;1,873,448&#9; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CET1 ratio &#9;13.8% &nbsp; &#9;14.7% Tier 1 ratio &#9;15.1% &nbsp; &#9;16.2% CAR &#9;16.9% &nbsp; &#9;18.1% b) Nu Mexico Financiera As of March 31, 2025, its regulatory capital reported to the local regulator was equivalent to US$$311,891 (US$288,654 as of December 31, 2024), resulting in a Capital ratio of 18.3% (19.2% as of December 31, 2024), with 10.5% being the minimum required for Category 4 Sociedades Financieras Populares (&quot;SOFIPO&quot;). &nbsp; &nbsp; 68 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.
