The amendments include the following changes to the proxy access provisions of the Bylaws: (1) Ownership of loaned shares is deemed to continue for purposes of meeting the three-year, three percent continuous ownership requirement, so long as a nominating shareholder has the power to recall the loaned shares within five business days. Previously, a nominating shareholder was required to recall the loaned shares within five business days of being notified that its proxy access candidate would be included in Apple&#8217;s proxy materials, and hold the shares until the annual meeting of shareholders. (2) Apple increased the availability of proxy access by limiting the circumstances under which the maximum number of proxy access candidates is reduced. (3) Shareholders may re-nominate a proxy access candidate regardless of the level of support received at the annual meeting of shareholders. Previously, shareholders were prohibited from re-nominating a proxy access candidate if he or she received less than 25% support at either of the last two annual meetings of shareholders . (4) Apple extended the deadline by which nominating shareholders and proxy access candidates must provide certain information to Apple to ten business days from five business days. (5) Apple narrowed the scope of a nominating shareholder&#8217;s indemnification obligations to legal and regulatory violations arising out of a nominating shareholder&#8217;s actions or communications with Apple shareholders or out of information provided by a nominating shareholder to Apple. (6) Apple limited the discretion of the Board to unilaterally interpret the proxy access provisions. The amendments also incorporate a number of ministerial, clarifying and conforming changes, including changes in Articles II, III, V, VI, VII and VIII to remove provisions relating to certain officer titles that are not currently utilized by Apple, and track certain provisions of the California Corporations Code. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
