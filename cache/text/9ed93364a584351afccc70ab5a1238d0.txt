We expect Model Y to once again be the best -selling vehicle, of any kind, globally for the full year 2024, and we have made it even better, with the New Model Y now launched in all markets. In 2024, we made significant investments in infrastructure that will spur the next wave of growth for the company, including vehicle manufacturing capabilities for new models, AI training compute and energy storage manufacturing capacity. Affordability remains top of mind for customers, and we continue to review every aspect of our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle 5 to help alleviate this concern. In Q4, COGS per vehicle reached its lowest level ever at <$35,000, driven largely by raw material cost improvement, helping us to partially offset our investment in compelling financing and lease options. The Energy business achieved another record in Q4 with its highest -ever gross profit generation. Construction of Megafactory Shanghai was completed in December and will begin ramping this quarter. Powerwall deployments achieved another record quarter as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3 production and launch in additional markets. 2025 will be a seminal year in Tesla’s history as FSD (Supervised) continues to rapidly improve with the aim of ultimately exceeding human levels of safety. This will eventually unlock an unsupervised FSD option for our customers and the Robotaxi business, which we expect to begin launching later this year in parts of the U.S. We also continue to work on launching FSD (Supervised) in Europe and China in 2025.

New Model Y has launched on the configurator globally with production ramp and deliveries beginning later in Q1. US: California, Nevada and Texas Semi Factory construction continued in Q4 and recently completed roof and wall enclosure of the main building area. First truck builds are scheduled to start by end of 2025 with ramp beginning in early 2026. Preparation is underway for Cybercab lines at Gigafactory Texas with volume production planned for 2026. Given its unique functionality – including Powershare, stainless steel exterior, enhanced durability and bioweapon defense mode – we deployed a fleet of Cybertrucks equipped with Starlink in the Los Angeles area to help first responders and those impacted by the fires get access to electricity and Wi- Fi. We expect Cybertruck to be eligible for the IRA consumer tax credit, helping to improve affordability and access for even more customers. APAC: Shanghai In Q4, we achieved record deliveries in China as Model Y became the best -selling vehicle for the full year. Tesla also became the fastest growing brand in South Korea, and we launched vehicle sales in the Philippines. Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg In 2024, Model Y was the best -selling vehicle of any type in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands and we expect Model Y to have been the second best -selling vehicle of any type in Europe. Tesla was the most sold brand in Norway for the fourth year in a row with Model Y and Model 3 the best - and second-best selling cars of any type in 2024. 9 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% US/Canada Europe China Million miles driven before an accident occurs C O R E T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised) (billions) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware In Q4, we completed the deployment of Cortex, a ~50k H100 training cluster at Gigafactory Texas. Cortex helped enable V13 of FSD (Supervised) 1, which boasts major improvements in safety and comfort thanks to 4.2x increase in data, higher resolution video inputs, 2x reduction in photon-to-control latency and redesigned controller, among other enhancements. FSD (Supervised) can now start from park and perform unpark, reverse and park capabilities. In Q4, Tesla vehicles using Autopilot technology drove 5.94 million miles between accidents 2 – the best Q4 ever – compared to the U.S. average of .70 million miles. Progress on Optimus hardware and software continued in Q4, including the latest generation hand, robust locomotion and training on additional tasks, ahead of planned pilot production in 2025. Vehicle and Other Software The holiday release included Apple Watch support - customers can pair their watch as a key to unlock and lock their vehicle without ever pressing a button just like the phone key. With a Premium Connectivity subscription, Dashcam and Sentry Mode clips can be viewed and downloaded directly from the Tesla mobile app. An animated three -hour precipitation forecast can be viewed on the map, and SiriusXM is now available to our full lineup with launch as a native app for Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck. Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing We processed our first spodumene (lithium- containing concentrate) through the front -end of the lithium refinery only 18 months after ground- breaking: much faster than any plant we know of outside of Asia. The intermediate material was on- spec, and we are on track to commission the plant in 2025.

Services and Other – a collection of businesses that support new vehicle sales – achieved its third year in a row of profitability in 2024. Energy Generation and Storage The Energy business achieved record deployments for both Powerwall and Megapack at a combined 11.0 GWh, resulting in a record gross profit in Q4. Material and other costs continued to come down in Q4 at the Lathrop Megafactory. Both Powerwall and Megapack continue to be supply constrained as we open new markets and demand for energy storage products continues to grow. With construction completed, Shanghai Megafactory will begin ramping in Q1. Services and Other In Q4, we added over 3k Supercharger stalls to the network and delivered 1.4 TWh of energy. We unveiled our V4 cabinet, which supports 400V -1,000V vehicle architectures, charges up to 500kW for passenger vehicles and 1.2MW for Tesla Semi and has cutting - edge power electronics with 3x the power density. We launched Battery Heating at Superchargers, a feature that gets vehicles with LFP battery packs back on the road up to 4x faster. We also continued to welcome more OEMs to the North American Supercharger network, including the first NACS native vehicles. Overall, in 2024, we launched Superchargers in three new countries, added over 10k new Supercharger stalls, and grew the network by 19% year -over-year, for a total of 65k+ Superchargers worldwide. We delivered 5.2+ TWh, offsetting over 5.5 billion kg of direct CO 2 emissions and 2.4 billion liters of gasoline. 11 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 -1,000 -800 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 O U T L O O K Volume With the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to g rowth in 2025. The rate of growth will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, pro duction ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment. We expect energy storage deployments to grow at least 50% year -over-year in 2025. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hard ware- related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits. Product Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line -up. This approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This should help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 60% growth over 2024 production before investing in new manufacturing lines. Our purpose-built Robotaxi product – Cybercab – will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy and is scheduled for volume production starting in 2026. 12 P H O T O S & C H A R T S A V E R A G E C O G S P E R V E H I C L E * A C H I E V E D A N A L L – T I M E L O W I N Q 4 2 0 2 4 14 $32,000 $33,000 $34,000 $35,000 $36,000 $37,000 $38,000 $39,000 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 * Calculated by dividing Cost of Automotive Sales Revenue by respective quarter’s new deliveries (ex-operating leases) C Y B E R T R U C K - A D V A N C E M E N T S I N V E H I C L E T E C H N O L O G Y A N D A R C H I T E C T U R E 15 Technology Description Use in Future Vehicles Manufacturing and Design Stainless Steel Exoskeleton • Cold-rolled full hard stainless steel exoskeleton carries crash loads and increases torsional stiffness of the body • Iconic visual design; high dent- and corrosion- resistance reduce concerns over daily wear and tear Air Bending Manufacturing Process • First-of-its-kind automated tooling developed by Tesla that can bend full hard stainless steel without touching it • Enables the use of full hard stainless steel as an A-surface without getting scratched by tooling Giga-castings • Our largest castings ever - custom alloy and a 9,000-ton press combine to make front and rear vehicle structures • Reduces number of parts and manufacturing complexity, and, as a bonus, scrap is fully recyclable ✓ Integrated Audio with Body Structure • Utilizes the body structure as the reactive volume for dual subwoofers • Giant sound in extremely dense packaging ✓ Powertrain and Electrical Architecture 48-Volt Electrical Architecture • 48-volt electrical system reduces current by 4x and heat generated by 16x compared to typical automotive voltage • Reduction in vehicle harness reduces vehicle weight, increases energy efficiency and simplifies electrical systems ✓ 800-Volt Battery System • Higher voltage powertrain is more energy efficient for high power vehicles such as Cybertruck and Tesla Semi • Enables smaller cables which reduces cost and mass while also enabling higher power (500kW) charging ✓ Etherloop Communication Architecture • Gigabit ethernet communication is 1,000x faster than traditional automotive communication standards • Enables distributed controller architecture which improves redundancy and eliminates 70% of cross-vehicle wires ✓ Bidirectional Charging (Powershare) • The Cybertruck can provide power to your jobsite, home or other devices (Vehicle -to-Grid or Vehicle-to-Home) • Turns vehicles into mobile energy storage units with up to 11.5kW of onboard power, enabling hours of work ✓ Ride and Comfort Custom Laminated Glass • Novel glass and laminate developed by Tesla for increased comfort and strength • Improves sound isolation and blocks harmful UV, keeping the cabin cool while maintaining a panoramic view ✓ Adaptive Air Suspension • Adjusts ride height and damping for different terrains with 12” of adjustment getting up to 16” of ground clearance • Improves on-road comfort and stability without sacrificing off-road capability ✓ Steer-by-Wire • Replaces traditional steer shaft with redundant controllers and motors, enabling an adjustable steering ratio for different speeds and driving styles • Reduces the amount you need to turn the wheel, enabling more agility at low speeds and more stability at high speeds ✓ Rear Wheel Steering • Leveraging steer-by-wire, enables approximately ten degrees of steering on the rear wheels • Improves turning radius at low speeds and increases stability at high speeds ✓ N E W M O D E L Y - T H E W O R L D ’ S B E S T S E L L I N G V E H I C L E I S N O W E V E N B E T T E R 16 N E W M O D E L Y - T H E W O R L D ’ S B E S T S E L L I N G V E H I C L E I S N O W E V E N B E T T E R 17 N E W M O D E L Y - T H E W O R L D ’ S B E S T S E L L I N G V E H I C L E I S N O W E V E N B E T T E R 18 * Before estimated savings, Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $46,630 (U.S) and New Model Y Launch Series Long Range All-Wheel Drive starts at $61,630 (U.S.).

a live webcast of its fourth quarter 2024 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on January 29, 2025 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. "Adjusted EBITDA" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. "Free cash flow" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.
