JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 – More than $255 billion of capital raised for clients – More than $17 billion of credit1 provided and capital raised for nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities Hired nearly 5,300 U.S. veterans and service members since the beginning of 2011 New York, April 12, 2013 - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported record net income of $6.5 billion for the first quarter of 2013, compared with net income of $4.9 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Earnings per share were a record $1.59, compared with $1.19 in the first quarter of 2012. Revenue1 for the quarter was $25.8 billion, compared with $26.8 billion in the prior year. The Firm's return on tangible common equity1 for the first quarter of 2013 was 17%, compared with 15% in the prior year. As previously announced, the Board of Directors intends to increase the second-quarter common stock dividend to $0.38 per share3 from the current $0.30 per share, returning the dividend to its highest level. The Board has also authorized the Firm to repurchase $6 billion of common equity commencing with the second quarter of this year through the end of the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2013, the Firm repurchased $2.6 billion of common equity. The Federal Reserve asked the Firm to submit by the end of the third quarter an additional capital plan addressing the weaknesses it identified in the Firm's capital planning processes. The Firm is dramatically increasing the resources deployed and intends to fully address their requirements. Following their review, the Federal Reserve may require the Firm to modify its capital distributions. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial results: “JPMorgan Chase had a very good start to the year. All our businesses had strong performance, and our client franchises did exceptionally well. The Corporate & Investment Bank was #1 in fees, global debt and equity, syndicated loans, and announced M&A. Those leadership positions reflect the volume of business we do with clients and it is a great result. Consumer & Community Banking deposits were up 10% compared with the prior year, client investment assets were up 15%, and mortgage loan originations were up 37%. Asset Management also had strong performance with loan balances up 27% compared with the prior year. Assets under supervision were up 8% to $2.2 trillion. This business achieved a record $31 billion of net long-term client flows for the first quarter.” Dimon continued: “We are seeing positive signs that the economy is healthy and getting stronger. Housing prices continued to improve and new home purchases are also starting to come back. We also saw strong performance in our credit card portfolio, with net charge-offs remaining near historic lows, another sign that consumers are healthier and more confident. As a result, we reduced the allowance for loan losses in Consumer & Community Banking in the first quarter by a total of $1.2 billion and are likely to see further releases. Credit conditions were also favorable across the wholesale loan portfolios.” Dimon added: “The exception is that loan growth across the industry has been softer this quarter, although year-on-year growth remained strong. Small businesses remain cautious about the recovery and fiscal uncertainty, and are not investing their capital. However, companies' balance sheets are much stronger than they were before the financial crisis and small businesses remain well positioned to invest in growth once they decide to. With approximately 2 million small business customers, Chase remains the nation's #1 Small Business Administration lender and we plan to serve more customers when loan demand comes back.” Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: “We strengthened our fortress balance sheet, ending the first quarter with Basel I Tier 1 common capital of $143 billion and a resulting ratio1 of 10.2%; this includes the impact of the Basel 2.5 rules that became effective at the beginning of this year. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1 was approximately 8.9%4 at the end of the first quarter, up from 8.7% in the fourth quarter.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Dimon continued: “We are pleased that our capital strength and earnings power will allow the Firm to return excess capital to our shareholders. We are also doing our part to support the economic recovery, providing credit1 and raising capital totaling $480 billion for our clients in the first quarter. As I said in my letter to shareholders distributed this week in the 2012 annual report, we have work to do to strengthen our controls and carry out our compliance mission. To do so, we have reprioritized our business agenda to focus on this critical effort – it is the top priority for our company. There is no room for compromise in meeting our obligations to comply with the new regulatory requirements and ensure that our systems, practices, controls, technology and, above all, culture meet the highest standards. And we will continue to work with our regulators on our common interest – to build and sustain a strong and safe financial system.” Dimon concluded: “We are very pleased with our first-quarter results, are proud of our accomplishments and remain optimistic about the future.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, an increase of $147 million, or 9%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related2 expense and performance-based compensation. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Pretax margin2 was 29%, up from 26% in the prior year. Return on equity was 22% on $9 billion of average allocated capital. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2013, assets under management reflected net inflows of $53 billion, driven by net inflows of $74 billion to long-term products and net outflows of $21 billion from liquidity products. For the quarter, net inflows were $28 billion reflecting record net inflows of $31 billion to long-term products. Net long-term client flows were positive for the sixteenth consecutive quarter. Assets under management ranked in the top two quartiles for investment performance were 75% over 5 years, 74% over 3 years and 70% over 1 year. Customer assets in 4 and 5 Star-rated funds were 51% of all rated mutual fund assets. Record assets under supervision were $2.2 trillion, up 8% from the prior year and 4% from the prior quarter. Record average loans were $80.0 billion, up 35% from the prior year and 5% from the prior quarter.

See notes on page 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $25,122 million, $23,653 million, and $26,052 million for the first quarter of 2013, fourth quarter of 2012, and first quarter of 2012, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.5 billion, up $1.6 billion, or 33%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue. Net revenue was $25.8 billion, down $909 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.8 billion, down $167 million, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter revenue included a $126 million gain from DVA on certain structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the widening of the Firm's credit spreads. Net interest income was $11.1 billion, down $742 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as well as lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and portfolio run-off, lower investment securities yield, and limited reinvestment opportunities, partially offset by lower long-term debt costs, primarily due to a change in mix and lower deposit costs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 The provision for credit losses was $617 million, down $109 million, or 15%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $545 million, down $92 million from the prior year. The current- quarter consumer provision included a $1.2 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses reflecting improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.7 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.92% and 2.60%, respectively. The decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $72 million, compared with $89 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $35 million, compared with $5 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.05% and 0.01%, respectively. The Firm's allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained1 was 2.27%, compared with 3.11% in the prior year. The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $11.6 billion at March 31, 2013, down from $11.7 billion in the prior quarter and down from $12.0 billion in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $2.9 billion, or 16%, compared with the prior year. The prior- year noninterest expense included $2.5 billion of additional litigation reserves. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Basel I Tier 1 common ratio1 was 10.2% at March 31, 2013, including the impact of the Basel 2.5 rules that became effective on January 1, 2013. Headcount was 255,898, a decrease of 5,271, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion at March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, and March 31, 2012. In Corporate & Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represents common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firm's earnings as a percentage of average TCE. In management's view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as to analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. d. The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III.” In June 2012, U.S. federal banking agencies also published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the “NPR”) for implementing Basel III in the United States. Basel III revised Basel II by, among other things, narrowing the definition of capital, and increasing capital requirements for specific exposures. Basel III also includes higher capital ratio requirements. The Firm's estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III reflects the Firm's current understanding of the Basel III rules based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies and on the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted; it excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules, possible enhancements to certain market risk models, and any further implementation guidance from the regulators. e. In Consumer & Community Banking, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented include loans held-for-sale. f. Corporate & Investment Bank provides several measures which exclude the impact of debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) on: net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Consumer & Community Banking deposit rankings are based on the Firm's and peer disclosures for 2012. The Consumer & Business Banking SBA ranking is based on number of loans from October 2012 to February 2013 (SBA fiscal year to date). Accounts includes checking accounts and Chase LiquidSM cards (launched 2Q12). c. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense for Mortgage Production. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the fourth quarter of 2012. e. In Commercial Banking, effective January 1, 2013, whole loan financing agreements, previously reported as other assets, were reclassified as loans. For the quarter ended March 31, 2013, the impact on period-end loans and average loans was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. f. Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of AM against the performance of their respective peers. g. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.

ROTCE measures the Firm's annualized earnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. For further discussion of these measures, see page 42 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (c) Share prices shown for JPMorgan Chase's common stock are from the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase's common stock is also listed and traded on the London Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. (d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (e) Return on Basel I risk-weighted assets is the annualized earnings of the Firm divided by its average risk-weighted assets. (f) In the first quarter of 2013, the Firm implemented rules that provide for additional capital requirements for trading positions and securitizations (“Basel 2.5”). This implementation resulted in an increase to risk-weighted assets of approximately $150 billion and decreases to the Firm’s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 common capital ratios of 140 bps, 160 bps and 120 bps, respectively. (g) Basel I Tier 1 common capital ratio (“Tier 1 common ratio”) is Tier 1 common capital (“Tier 1 common”) divided by risk-weighted assets. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Tier 1 common capital ratio, see page 42 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.
