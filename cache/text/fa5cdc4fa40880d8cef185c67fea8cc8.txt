(b) Represents Firmwide merchant processing volume. (c) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 133–135 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information, and pages 84–86 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023 for further information. (d) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across CIB risks. (e) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures. Page 18 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

The Firm elected to apply its portfolio-based allowance approach to substantially all its non-collateral dependent modified loans to troubled borrowers, resulting in a net decrease in the beginning balance of the allowance for loan losses of $587 million, predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card.

(b) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding CIB’s trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the wholesale allowance coverage ratio. (c) Refer to footnote (a) on page 26 for information on the Firm’s nonaccrual policy for credit card loans. (d) At September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, included $396 million and $667 million and $377 million and $695 million of Consumer and Wholesale, respectively, associated with First Republic. (e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Page 28 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures (a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. (b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. (d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio. (e) In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”), net yield, and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets), as shown below. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income.These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk- managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

(a) On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC, resulting in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion recorded in other income. The bargain purchase gain generally represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price and is subject to change for up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, and as the settlement with the FDIC is finalized. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, measurement period adjustments of $100 million were recorded, resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. (b) Excludes $1.9 billion of loans transferred to the CIB as part of the First Republic acquisition. Page 30
