cannot. A quarter of a century in the making, NVIDIA accelerated computing is broadly recognized as the way to advance computing as Moore’s law ends and AI lifts off. NVIDIA’s platform is installed in several hundred million computers, is available in every cloud and from every server maker, powers 74% of the TOP500 supercomputers, and boasts over 4 million developers. Headquarters: Santa Clara, CA What Is Accelerated Computing? Not just a superfast chip – accelerated computing is a full-stack combination of: • Chip(s) with specialized processors • Algorithms in acceleration libraries • Domain experts to refactor applications To speed-up compute-intensive parts of an application. A full-stack approach: silicon, systems, software For example: • If 90% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 9X • If 99% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 50X • If 80% of the runtime can be accelerated by 500X, or even 1000X, the application is sped up 5X Amdahl’s law: The overall system speed-up (S) gained by optimizing a single part of a system by a factor (s) is limited by the proportion of execution time of that part (p). 𝑆 = 1 1 − 𝑝 + 𝑝 𝑠 Why Accelerated Computing? Accelerated computing is needed to tackle the most impactful opportunities of our time—like AI, climate simulation, drug discovery, ray tracing, and robotics. NVIDIA is uniquely dedicated to accelerated computing —working top-to-bottom—refactoring applications and creating new algorithms, and bottom-to-top—inventing new specialized processors, like RT Core and Tensor Core. “It’s the end of Moore’s Law as we know it.” - John Hennessy Oct 23, 2018 “Moore’s Law is dead.” - Jensen Huang, GTC 2013 Advancing computing in the post-Moore’s Law era 102 103 104 105 106 107 109 108 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 GPU-Computing perf 2X per year 1000X In 10 years Single-threaded CPU perf 1.5X perf per year 1.1X per year Trillions of Operations per Second (TOPS) NVIDIA’s Accelerated Computing Platform Full-stack innovation across silicon, systems and software With nearly three decades of a singular focus, NVIDIA is expert at accelerating software and scaling compute by a Million-X, going well beyond Moore’s law. Accelerated computing is a full-stack challenge, demanding deep understanding of the problem domain, optimizing across every layer of computing, and all three chips —GPU, CPU, and DPU. Scaling across multi-GPUs and multi-nodes is a data center-scale challenge and requires treating the network and storage as part of the computing fabric. Our platform extends from PCs to supercomputing centers, enterprise data centers, cloud and edge environments. cuNumeric CV-CUDA cuQuantum Parabricks Sionna Jetpack RAPIDS Spark cuDNN cuGraph TensorRT Triton Deepstream Flare DOCA Mag IO Aerial NVIDIA HPC NVIDIA AI NVIDIA Omniverse RTX DGX HGX EGX OVX AGXSuper POD IGX DPUCPUGPU 3-CHIPS PLATFORMS AI APPLICATION FRAMEWORK ACCELERATION LIBRARIES CLOUD-TO-EDGE DATACENTER-TO- ROBOTIC SYSTEMS NVIDIA’s Expanding Accelerated Computing Ecosystem 300 Libraries 400 AI Models 2020 2023 AI Startups 6K 14K Developers 2020 2023 4M 1.8M 100 Updated in the Last Year 2020 2023 CUDA Downloads* 40M 20M *Cumulative 2020 2023 GPU-Accelerated Applications 3,000 700 NVIDIA’s Multi-Sided Platform and Flywheel NVIDIA is valued by every stakeholder in the ecosystem: • For developers – NVIDIA’s one Architecture and large installed base give developer’s software the best performance and greatest reach • For computer makers and CSPs – NVIDIA’s rich suite of Acceleration Platforms lets partners build one offering to address large markets including media & entertainment, healthcare, transportation, energy, financial services, manufacturing, retail, and more • For customers – NVIDIA is offered by virtually every computing provider and accelerates the most impactful applications from cloud to edge • For NVIDIA – Deep engagement with developers, computing providers, and customers in diverse industries enables unmatched expertise, scale, and speed of innovation across the entire accelerated computing stack – propelling the flywheel 4 Million Developers Global Computer Makers and CSPs 35,000 Organizations Across Industries NVIDIA Accelerated Computing Full-Stack Expertise and Scale CUDA Installed Base Wealth of Accelerated Apps Demand and New Opportunities 100’s of Systems CSPs Worldwide Full-Stack Acceleration for Largest Industries Full-Stack & Data Center Scale Acceleration Drive Significant Cost Savings and Workload Scaling Classical Computing—960 CPU-only servers Accelerated Computing—2 GPU servers 25X lower cost 84X better energy-efficiency Application Application Re-Engineered for Acceleration Magnum IO CUDA-X Acceleration Libraries CPU server racks LLM Workload: Bert-Large Training and Inference | CPU Server: Dual-EYPC 7763 | GPU Server: Dual-EPYC 7763 + 8X H100 PCIe GPUs Training & Inference — One Architecture Cloud | On-Prem | Edge TRAINING AI FACTORIES TRAINING INFERENCE IN THE DATA CENTER NVIDIA L40 Image Generation NVIDIA L4 AI Video NVIDIA H100 NVL Large Language Models NVIDIA Grace Hopper Recommendation Models AGX Functionally-Safe System for Autonomous Vehicles IGX Industrial-Grade System for Healthcare, Logistics, Manufacturing AT THE EDGE AI FACTORIES AI Is the Greatest Technology Force of Our Time Data centers across industries will become AI factories Meeting TranscriptionContact Center AI 3B Meeting Minutes / Day500M Calls / Day Public Safety >1B Smart City Cameras Deployed Retail Asset Protection $94.5B Inventory Loss / Year Industrial InspectionMedical Imaging $32M Vision Sensors Installed by 2025 10M Diagnostic Scans / Day Transportation 10T Miles / Year Credit Card Fraud 1.28B Credit Transactions / Day Product Recommendations 1B E-Commerce Visitors / Day AI has fundamentally changed what software can make and how you make software. Companies are processing & refining their data, making AI software—becoming intelligence manufacturers. Their data centers are AI factories. The first wave of AI was learned perception and inference, like recognizing images, understanding speech, recommending a video, or an item to buy. In late 2022, ChatGPT ushered in Generative AI – unlocking new opportunities for AI to generate text, images, video, code, or proteins. The next wave of AI is robotics and industrial digitalization — robots, avatars, and digital twins – where AI interacts with the physical world. NVIDIA’s acceleration stacks and ecosystems help bring AI to the world’s largest industries. NVIDIA’s world-class AI expertise and scale can help revolutionize businesses.

NVIDIA Gross Margins Reflect Value of Acceleration FY23 financial metrics reflect a $2.2B charge for inventory and related reserves primarily related to Data Center and Gaming. Fiscal year ends in January. Refer to Appendix for reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. Gross margins are rounded to the nearest percent. Accelerated computing requires full-stack and data center-scale innovation across silicon, systems, algorithms and applications. Significant expertise and effort are required, but application speed-ups can be incredible, resulting in dramatic cost and time-to-solution savings. For example, 10 NVIDIA HGX nodes with 80 NVIDIA A100 GPUs that cost $4M can replace 920 nodes of CPU servers that cost over $50M for AI inference. NVIDIA chips carry the value of the full-stack, not just the chip. Strong Cash Flow Generation Fiscal year ends in January.
