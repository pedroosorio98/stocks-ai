In Brazil, the total customers totaled 57.3 million , of which the SME customer base was up 167% , growing to 1.6 million as of March 31, 2022 from 0.6 million as of March 31, 2021. In Mexico, Nu&acute;s customer base increased 950% and reached 2.1 million . In addition, customers in Colombia reached 211,000 . Activity Rate increased 9.6 pp to 78% as of March 31, 2022, from 69% at the close of 1Q21, reaching a historic-high, and reflecting increased engagement, along with product upsell and cross-sell to customers who continue migrating more of their financial lives to Nu&rsquo;s platform. Purchase Volume reached $15.9 billion in Q1'22, expanding 112% YoY, or 94% YoY FXN. Volume expansion was driven by both growth in Nu&rsquo;s customer base and by the maturation of Nu&rsquo;s existing customers cohorts as well as higher usage across Nu&rsquo;s product portfolio comprised of credit, prepaid, secured and Ultraviolet cards.&nbsp; Deposits &nbsp;increased 129% YoY, or 94% FXN, to $12.6 billion at March 31, 2022, reflecting growth in Nu&rsquo;s customer base together with the ongoing execution of the Company's strategy to grow its deposit franchise, as a key pillar of its funding strategy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest-Earning Portfolio reached $3.1 billion on March 31, 2022, increasing 417% YoY, or 343% YoY on an FX neutral basis. Growth was driven primarily by the ramp up of the personal loans book, which posted a net increase of approximately $1.7 billion . Another contributor was the introduction of new credit card consumer finance products, including purchase financing, boleto (bank slip) financing and bill refinancing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Monthly Average Revenue per Active Customer (ARPAC) increased 91 % YoY, or 63% FXN, to $6.7 in Q1'22. This increase largely reflects the maturation of Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts, the rollout of new products and features, together with a healthy increase in transaction volumes, the robust expansion of Nu&acute;s interest-earning portfolio, and growth in purchase volumes and related interchange fees earned. Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer declined 13% YoY, or 30 % FXN, to $ 0.73 in Q1'22, reflecting a reduction in transaction expenses per customer, in line with Nu&acute;s goal of expanding its ecosystem at scale. Excluding any one-off effects, there is an improvement of 10 cents of dollar in the average cost to serve compared to the first quarter of 2021 also on a FX neutral basis, a continued improvement that shows the benefits of scale and operating leverage as the Company grows. As shown in the charts below, Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts reflect a sustained expansion in the ratios and growth of primary banking accounts, number of products per monthly active customer, and monthly ARPAC. &nbsp; Compounding Effect of More Engagement and More Products &nbsp; Non-Performing Loans Delinquency Nu&rsquo;s 90+ NPL ratio increased 70 bps in the quarter. However, if adjusted for seasonality and product mix, 90+ NPL ratio would have increased by 30 bps , in line with expectations. Nu&rsquo;s 15-90 NPL ratio increased 110 bps i n the quarter. However, if adjusted for seasonality and product mix, 15-90 NPL ratio would have remained unchanged . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit Quality Normalizing and Affected By Seasonality &nbsp; &nbsp; Note 1: Consumer Finance data includes credit card and personal unsecured loans. Note 2: The information presented is for Brazil only. Note 3: NPL means &quot;non-performing loan;&quot; 15-90 NPL means a non-performing loan where a borrower is between 15 and 90 days past due. 90+ NPL means a non-performing loan where a borrower is more than 90 days past due.

Note 5: Please refer to slide 32 for more information on seasonality. Source: Brazil&rsquo;s Central Bank, Nu. &nbsp; NPL Provisions Formation Driven by Consumer Finance Portfolio Growth &nbsp; Provisions increased 35% FXN , to $921 million in the Q1&rsquo;22, resulting mainly from the growth ( 80% ) in the consumer finance loan portfolio. The remaining 20% is a combination of risk normalization and seasonality, the majority of which coming from the latter. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strong Capital and Liquidity Position to Navigate the Cycle &nbsp; &nbsp; Capital In December 2021, Nu raised US$2.8 billion in the IPO, strengthening its capital position further, and adding to a total US$3.4 billion in excess capital that we kept at the holding level at the end of the first quarter. Liquidity In Q1'22, Nu reported an interest-earning portfolio of US$3.1bn while total deposits reached over four times this value with US$12.6bn . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; REVENUE, FINANCIAL AND TRANSACTIONAL COSTS AND GROSS PROFIT &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenue increased 258 % YoY, or 226 % FXN, to a record high of $877.2 million in Q1&rsquo;22. &nbsp; Revenue ($ million) Q1'22 Q1'21 Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments 619.4 127.3 Fee and Commission Income 257.8 117.7 Total 877.2 245.0 FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments 619.4 139.9 Fee and Commission Income 257.8 129.3 Total 877.2 269.2 &nbsp; Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments totaled $619.4 million in Q1&rsquo;22, increasing 387% YoY, or 343% YoY FXN, resulting mainly from higher net interest income in the consumer finance portfolio, consisting of personal loans and credit cards. The increase also reflects the rise in Brazil&rsquo;s interest rates during Q1'22 (the interbank deposit rate (CDI) averaged 10.3% p.a. in Q1&acute;22 versus 2.0% p.a. in Q1&rsquo;21) together with an increase in financial assets, as Nu continued to expand its retail deposit services in Brazil.&nbsp; Fee and Commission Income in Q1&acute;22 was $257.8 million , increasing 119% YoY , or 99% YoY FXN. This was principally the result of higher interchange fees, driven by higher credit and debit card purchase volumes as Nu continues to expand its customer base and their activity rates.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided increased 351% YoY, or 310% FXN to $583.1 million in the Q1'22. This cost represented 66% of revenue in Q1'22, compared to 53% in Q1'21, reflecting the following dynamics: &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided ($ Million) Q1'22 Q1'21 Interest and Other Financial Expenses (273.0) (31.7) Transactional Expenses (34.4) (26.3) Credit Loss Allowance Expenses (275.7) (71.3) Total (583.1) (129.3) % of Revenue 66% 53% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest and Other Financial Expenses (273.0) (34.8) Transactional Expenses (34.4) (28.9) Credit Loss Allowance Expenses (275.7) (78.4) Total (583.1) (142.1) % of Revenue 66% 53% &nbsp; The increase in Interest and Other Financial Expenses was mainly due to higher interest expenses on retail deposits that resulted from the aforementioned increase in Brazil&rsquo;s interest rates coupled with the expansion of Nu&rsquo;s retail deposit balance.&nbsp; The increase of Nu&rsquo;s interest-earning portfolio directly impacts the expansion of the Credit Loss Allowance Expenses as explained below. And demonstrated in the provisions bridge. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 154 % YoY and 131 % FXN to $294.1 million in Q1&acute;22. The gross profit margin was 34% compared to 47% in Q1'21, reflecting the impact of ECL credit provisioning under IFRS 9, together with the dual impact of the higher interbank rate which had a positive effect on revenues, but, to a lesser extent, also increased interest expenses, negatively impacting gross margins in the short-term. As the portfolio matures, Nu expects gross margins to converge to those observed in the credit bearing business for more mature cohorts. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OPERATING EXPENSES Operating Expenses totaled $361.8 million in Q1&acute;22, up 114% YoY , or 95% FXN, but declined to 41% of total revenues from 69% in Q1'21. The main driver behind the absolute increase in operating expenses was the 112 %, or 93 % FXN, growth in general and administrative expenses, principally due to higher share-based compensation resulting from the effect of associated payroll taxes expenses arising from the share price change in 2022 in comparison to 2021, together with the increase in headcount during the period. In addition, customer support and operations expenses increased 92% YoY , or 75% YoY FXN, reflecting the significant expansion in the customer base as well as investments to further enhance the overall user experience.&nbsp; &nbsp; Operating Expenses ($ million) Q1'22 Q1'21 Customer Support and Operations (61.6) (32.1) General and Administrative Expenses (245.1) (115.8) Marketing Expenses (27.6) (4.9) Other Income (expenses) (27.5) (16.2) Total (361.8) (169.0) % of Revenue 41% 69% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer Support and Operations (61.6) (35.3) General and Administrative Expenses (245.1) (127.3) Marketing Expenses (27.6) (5.4) Other Income (expenses) (27.5) (17.8) Total (361.8) (185.8) % of Revenue 41% 69% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EARNINGS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net Income (Loss) Nu reported a Net Loss of $45.1 million in Q1&acute;22, improving 9% YoY, or 17% FXN, from the $49.4 million Net Loss in Q1'21, as a result of the lower expansion of our expenses compared to the increase in revenue, supported by the growth of Nu&rsquo;s operations and customer base in all countries. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) In Q1'22, Nu reported an Adjusted Net Income of $10.1 million , compared with an Adjusted Net Loss of $11.9 million in Q1'21.

In addition to IFRS financials, this presentation includes certain summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial information. These summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. References in this presentation to &ldquo;R$&rdquo; refer to the Brazilian real, the official currency of Brazil. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This release includes financial measures defined as &ldquo;non-IFRS financial measures&rdquo; by the SEC, including: Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and certain FX Neutral measures and provides reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure. A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance or financial position that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company for the period, adjusted for expenses and allocated tax effects on share-based compensation in such period. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is presented because our management believes that this non-IFRS financial measure can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of our operating and financial performance, although it is not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. We also use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a key profitability measure to assess the performance of our business. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to evaluate our operating and financial performance for the following reasons: &#183; Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company&rsquo;s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period, depending on their accounting and tax methods, the book value and the market value of their assets and liabilities, and the method by which their assets were acquired. &#183; Non-cash equity grants made to executives, employees or consultants at a certain price and point in time, and their income tax effects, do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and the related expenses (and their subject impacts in the market value of our assets and liabilities) are not key measures of our core operating performance. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a substitute for Net Income, which is the IFRS measure of earnings. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including our competitors in the technology and financial services industries, because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner as we do, and therefore, our measure may not be comparable to those of other companies. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation For the the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 (In thousands of U.S. Dollars) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) ($ million) Q1'22 Q1'21 Profit (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of the Parent Company (45.1) (49.4) Share-based Compensation 77.7 48.9 Allocated Tax Effects on Share-based Compensation (22.5) (11.3) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 10.1 (11.9) &nbsp; FX Neutral measures are prepared and presented to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange, or &ldquo;FX,&rdquo; volatility between the comparison periods, allowing management and investors to evaluate our financial performance despite variations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. FX Neutral measures are presented because our management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of our operating and financial performance, although they are not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. The FX Neutral measures were calculated to present what such measures in preceding periods would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these preceding periods until the date of the Company's most recent financial information. The FX Neutral measures for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and the key business metrics for such period by the average Brazilian reais /U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 (R$5.570 to US$1.00) and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 (R$5.068 to US$1.00), so as to present what certain of our statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained stable from this past period until the three months ended March 31, 2022. The average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated as the average of the month-end rates for each month in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 as reported by Bloomberg. FX Neutral measures for deposits and interest-earning portfolio were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts as of March 31, 2021, by the spot Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates as of this date (R$5.634 to US$1.00), and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by using the spot rate as of March 31, 2022 (R$4.742 to US$1.00) so as to present what these amounts would have been had exchange rates been the same as those on March 31, 2021. The Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated using rates as of such dates as reported by Bloomberg. FX Rates - On a monthly basis, Nu translates its subsidiaries figures from their individual functional currency into Nu Holdings functional currency, the U.S. Dollars (&quot;US$&quot;), following the requirements of IAS 21 &quot;The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates&quot;.

As of January 31, 2022, income statement figures were divided by the average FX Rate of the month (R$ 5.5295, MXN 20.5014 and COP 3,998.1929 to US$ 1.00) and balance sheet figures were divided by the last price fx rate of the month (R$ 5.3102, MXN 20.5336 and COP 3,947.0100 to US$ 1.00). As of February 28, 2022, income statement figures were divided by the average FX Rate of the month (R$ 5.1929, MXN 20.4532 and COP 3,937.9400 to US$ 1.00) and balance sheet figures were divided by the last price FX Rate of the month (R$ 5.1522, MXN 20.4692 and COP 3,937.9400 to US$ 1.00). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of March 31, 2022, income statement figures were divided by the average FX Rate of the month (R$ 4.9620, MXN 20.5400 and COP 3,798.9841 to US$ 1.00) and balance sheet figures were divided by the last price FX Rate of the month (R$ 4.7417, MXN 19.8699 and COP 3,771.0500 to US$ 1.00). Equity figures are translated using the FX Rate on the date of each transaction. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Profit or Loss For the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except loss per share) &nbsp;
