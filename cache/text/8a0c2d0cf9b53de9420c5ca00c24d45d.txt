(NYSE: JPM) today reported 2007 fourth-quarter income from continuing operatio ns of $3.0 billion, or $0.86 per share, down 21% compared with $3.9 billion, or $1.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. For full-year 2007, income from continuing operations was a record $15.4 billion, or $4.38 per share, up 15% compared with $13.6 billion, or $3.82 per sh are, in 2006. Reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $3.0 billion, down fr om $4.5 billion in the prior year, which included a $622 million gain on the sale of select ed corporate trust businesses in the fourth quarter of 2006 that is not included in con tinuing operations. Reported earnings per share of $0.86 declined from $1.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Commenting on 2007 full-year and f ourth-quarter results, Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am pleased with our company’s record results for the year, despite our mixed performance in the fourth quarter. Ou r lower quarterly results were affected by the Investment Bank’s markdowns in subprime-relate d positions and weaker trading. In addition, our consumer home equity and subprime loan portfolios performed worse than we expected. “The diversified nature of our company helped offset areas of weakness. Asset Management, Treasury & Securities Services, Commercial Ba nking and Private Equity reported record or near-record revenue and earnings , while investment banking fees had strong growth in the quarter and were at record levels for the year . We also experienced organic growth across Retail Financial Services, wi th increases in deposits, ch ecking accounts and mortgage originations.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Dimon further remarked, “It is gratifying that we were able to achieve record full-year results while still adding $2.3 billion to our credit reserv es (which now total $10 billion); maintaining a strong 8.4% Tier 1 ca pital ratio; making important invest ments across the firm; and growing market share.” Looking ahead to 2008, Dimon commented, “We remain extremely cautious as we enter 2008. If the economy weakens substantially from here – for which, as a company, we need to be prepared – it will negatively affect business volumes and drive credit costs higher. However, we feel well-positioned given the investments and actions we have taken over the past few years to improve our businesses’ operating margin s, create a stronger systems infrastructure and build a fortress balance sheet. Regardless of the economic environment, with this solid foundation in place, we can continue to serve our clients well and build the business for the future.” In the discussion below of the business segments and JPMorgan Chase, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the im pact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 13). The following discussion compares the fourth quart er of 2007 with the fourth quarter of 2006 unless otherwise noted. INVESTMENT BANK (IB) Results for IB 3Q07 4Q06 ($ millions) 4Q07 3Q07 4Q06 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net Revenue $3,172 $2,946 $4,860 $226 8% ($1,688) (35)% Provision for Credit Losses 200 227 63 (27) (12) 137 217 Noninterest Expense 3,011 2,378 3,205 633 27 (194) (6) Net Income $124 $296 $1,009 ($172) (58)% ($885) (88)% Discussion of Results: Net income was $124 million, a decrease of $885 million, or 88%, compared with the prior year, reflecting lower net revenue and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $3.2 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion, or 35%, from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion, up 5% from the prior year, reflecting record advisory and equity underwriting fees, largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees. Advisory fees were $646 million, up 34%, and equity underwriting fees were $544 million, up 66%; both were driven by strong performance across all re gions. Debt underwriting fees of $467 million declined 39%, reflecting lower loan syndi cation and bond underwriti ng fees, which were negatively affected by market conditions. Fi xed Income Markets revenue was $615 million, down $1.4 billion, or 70%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to markdowns of $1.3 billion (net of hedges) on subprime positions , including subprime collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Fixed Income Markets re venue also decreased due to markdowns in securitized products on non-subprime mortgages and losses in credit trading. These lower results were offset partially by strong revenue in rates and currencies and improved results in commodities compared with a weak prior-year quarter. Equity Markets revenue was $578 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 million, down 40% from the prior year, as weaker trading results were offset partially by strong client revenue across businesses. Fixed Inco me Markets and Equity Markets included a combined benefit of $277 million from the wide ning of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, with an impact of $154 million and $123 million, respectively. Credit Portfolio revenue was $322 million, up 23% from the prior year, primarily due to higher trading revenue from hedging activities, partially offset by lower gains from loan workouts. The provision for credit losses was $200 million, co mpared with $63 million in the prior year. The increase in the provision resulted from a higher allowance for credit losses, primarily related to loan portfolio growth. Net recoveries were $9 million, compared with net charge-offs of $10 million in the prior year. The allowance fo r loan losses to average loans retained was 1.93% for the current quarter, an increase from 1.73% in the prior year. Average loans retained were $68.9 billion, an in crease of $7.0 billion, or 11%, from the prior quarter. Average fair value and held-for-sale lo ans were $25.0 billion, up $7.7 billion, or 44%, from the prior quarter due to leveraged lending activity. Noninterest expense was $3.0 bill ion, a decrease of $194 million, or 6%, from the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to lower performance-based compensation expense offset partially by higher transaction-related costs, reflecting increased volumes. Highlights Include:  Ranked #2 in Global Equity and Equ ity-Related; #1 in Global Syndicated Loans; #4 in Global Announced M&A; #2 in Global Debt, Equity and Equity-Related; and #2 in Global Long-Term Debt, based upon volume, according to Thomson Financial for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Return on equity was 2% and 15% on $21.0 billion of allocated capital for the fourth quarter and full year 2007, respectively.

Net revenue was $4.8 billion, an increase of $1.1 bil lion, or 29%, from th e prior year. Net interest income was $2.7 billi on, up $125 million, or 5%, due to higher home equity loan balances, wider loan spreads and higher deposit balances. These be nefits were offset partially by a shift to narrower–spread deposit products. Noninterest revenue was $2.1 billion, up $962 million, benefiting from a valuation adjustment of $499 million on the MSR asset; the absence of a prior-year $233 million loss related to $13.3 bill ion of mortgage loans transferred to held- for-sale; an increase in deposit-related fees; and increased mortgage loan servicing revenue. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 Noninterest revenue also benefited from the classification of certain mortgage loan origination costs as expense (loan origination costs previously netted against revenue commenced being recorded as an expens e in the first quarter of 2007 due to the adoption of SFAS 159 (“Fair Value Option”)). These benefits were offset pa rtially by the absence of prior-year gains on subprime mortgage loan sales and markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline in the current quarter. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, compared with $262 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision includes an incr ease of $395 million in the allowance for loan losses related to home equity loans as continued weak housing prices have resulted in an increase in estimated losses for high loan-to-va lue loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $248 million (1.05% net charge-off rate), comp ared with $51 million (0.24% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. In addition, the current-quarter provision includes a $125 million increase in the allowance for loan losses related to subprime mortgage loans, reflecting an increase in estimated losses and growth in th e portfolio. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $71 million (2.08% net charge-off rate), compared with $17 million (0.65% net charge- off rate) in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.5 billion, an increas e of $249 million, or 11%, from the prior year due to the classification of certain loan origin ation costs as expense due to the adoption of SFAS 159, higher mortgage producti on and servicing expense, an d investments in the retail distribution network. Regional Banking net income was $371 million, a decrease of $248 million, or 40%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $3.3 billion, up $396 million, or 14%, reflecting the absence of a prior-year $233 million loss relate d to $13.3 billion of mortgage loans transferred to held-for- sale. Net revenue also benefited from increased deposit-related fees, higher home equity loan balances, growth in deposits and wider loan spr eads. These benefits were offset partially by a shift to narrower–spread deposit products. Th e provision for credit losses was $915 million, compared with $165 million in the prior year. The increase in the provision was due to the home equity and subprime mortgage portfolios (s ee Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up $55 million, or 3%, from the prior year due to investments in the retail distribution network. Highlights Include:  Checking accounts totaled 10.8 million, up 844,000, or 8%, from the prior year.  Average total deposits increased to $208.5 billion, up $7.8 billion, or 4%, from the prior year.  Average home equity loans of $94.0 bi llion increased from $84.2 billion in the prior year.  Business Banking loan originations were $1.7 billion, up 10% from the prior year.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Mortgage Banking net income was $332 million, compared with $34 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $1.1 billion, up $649 million. Net revenue comprises production revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue. Produc tion revenue was $321 million, up $106 million, benefiting from an increase in mortgage loan orig inations and the classification of certain loan origination costs as expense (loan origina tion costs previously netted against revenue commenced being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2007 due to the adoption of SFAS 159). These benefits were offset partially by the absence of prior-year gains on subprime mortgage loan sales and markdowns on the mort gage warehouse and pipeline in the current quarter. Net mortgage servici ng revenue, which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $738 million, compared with $195 million in the prior year. Loan servicing re venue of $665 million increased by $67 million on growth of 17% in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management revenue of $466 million improved $497 million from the prior year, reflecting a $499 million valuation adjustment to the MSR asset due to a decrease in estimated future mortgage prepayments, which positively affected the fair value of the MSR asset. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were negative $393 million compared with negative $372 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $518 million, an increase of $164 m illion, or 46%. The increase reflected the classification of certain loan origination co sts due to the adopti on of SFAS 159, higher servicing costs due to increased delinquencies and defaults, and higher production expense due in part to growth in originations. Highlights Include:  Mortgage loan originati ons were $40.0 billion, up 34% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter.  Total third-party mortgage loans serv iced were $614.7 billion, an increase of $88.0 billion, or 17%, from the prior year. Auto Finance net income was $49 million, a decrease of $16 million, or 25%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $450 million, up $39 milli on, or 9%, reflecting higher automobile operating lease revenue. The provision for credit losses was $133 million, up $36 million, reflecting an increase in estimated losses. Th e net charge-off rate wa s 1.27% compared with 0.75% in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $237 million increased by $30 million, or 14%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Highlights Include:  Auto loan originations were $5.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year.  Average loan receivables were $41.1 billion, up 6% from the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The decrease was driven by an increase in the provi sion for credit losses offset primarily by higher net managed revenue and lower noninterest expense. End-of-period managed loans of $157.1 billion increased by $4.2 billion, or 3%, from the prior year and $8.0 billion, or 5%, from the prior quarter. Averag e managed loans of $151.7 billion increased $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior year and $3.1 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter. The increases in both end-of-period and average managed loans re sulted from organic growth. Net managed revenue was $4.0 billion, an increase of $221 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.1 billion, up $195 million, or 7%, from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was driven by a higher level of fees, a wider loan spread and higher average loan balances. These benefits were o ffset partially by the di scontinuation of certain billing practices (including the elimination of certain over-limit fees and the two-cycle billing method for calculating finance char ges beginning in the second quarter of 2007) and the effect of higher revenue reversals asso ciated with higher charge-offs . Noninterest revenue was $834 million, an increase of $26 million, or 3%, from the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher net interchange income on growth in charge volume. Charge volume growth of 2% reflected an 8% increase in sales volume, offset primarily by a lower level of balance transfers, the result of more targeted marketing efforts. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 8 billion, an increase of $507 million, or 40%, from the prior year, due to an increase of $300 million in the allowance for loan losses and a higher level of charge-offs. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.89%, up from 3.45% in the prior year and 3.64% in th e prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.48%, up from 3.13% in the prior year and 3.25% in the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $ 66 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $758 million, up $50 millio n, or 7%. The increase was driven by double- digit growth in liability and loan balances, pr imarily offset by a continued shift to narrower– spread liability products and spread compre ssion in the loan and liability portfolios. Noninterest revenue was $326 million, up $16 milli on, or 5%, due to higher deposit-related fees, largely offset by lower investment banking revenue. Middle Market Banking revenue was $695 million, an increase of $34 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was $239 million, an increase of $41 million, or 21%. Real Estate Banking revenue was $102 million, a decrease of $18 million, or 15%. The provision for credit losses was $105 million, compared with $111 million in the prior year.

These benefits were offset partially by spread compression on liability products. The current quarter also benefited from seasonally strong depositary rece ipts activity. Treasury Services net revenue was $824 million, an increase of $124 million, or 18%, from the prior year. This increase reflected wider market-driven spreads on higher liability balances and growth in electronic transaction volumes.

Discussion of Results:(see note (a) above) Net income was $249 million, a decrease of $912 million, or 79%, from the prior year. Results reflect the absence of a prior-y ear $622 million after-tax gain rela ted to the sale of selected corporate trust businesses and the absence of a prior-year benefit of $359 million for tax audit resolutions. Net income for Private Equity was $356 million, compared with $136 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $688 million, an increase of $438 m illion. The increase was driven by Private Equity gains of $712 million, compared with $ 287 million, reflecting a higher level of gains and the change in classification of carried in terest to compensation expense.

Net revenue on a GAAP basis wa s $17,384 million, $16,112 million and $16,193 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, third quarter of 2007 and fourth quarter of 2006, respectively. (b) Discontinued operations include the income statement activity of selected corporat e trust businesses sold to The Bank of Ne w York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Treasury & Securities Services. Discussion of Results: Net income was $3.0 billion, down $1.6 billion from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by a higher provi sion for credit losses and increa sed noninterest expense, primarily offset by growth in net managed revenue. Net managed revenue was $18.3 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 7%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.5 billion was down $512 million, or 5%, due to lower principal transactions revenue, which refl ected significantly lower tradi ng results driven by markdowns on subprime positions, including subprime collate ralized debt obligations (CDOs). The decrease was offset primarily by higher mort gage-related revenue, driven by a valuation adjustment to the MSR asset; and an increa se in asset management, administration and commissions revenue, reflecting growth in as sets under management and higher brokerage commissions. Additional offsets to the lower level of nonintere st revenue included an increase in private equity gains and higher lending and deposit-related fees. Net interest income was $8.8 billion, up $1.8 billion, or 25%, due to higher trading-related net interest income and growth in liability and deposit balances in the wholesale a nd consumer businesses. These increases were offset partially by a shift to narrower–spread deposit products. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 The managed provision for credit losses was $3 .2 billion, up $1.4 billion, or 83%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for cr edit losses was $308 million, compared with $184 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses, primarily related to portfolio growth. Wholesale net ch arge-offs were $25 million, compared with net charge-offs of $28 million, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 0.05% and 0.07%, respectively. The total consumer-managed provision for cred it losses was $2.9 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses largely related to home equity, credit ca rd and subprime mortgage loans, and higher net charge-offs. Consumer- managed net charge-offs were $2.0 billion, compar ed with $1.5 billion, resulting in a managed net charge-off rate of 2.22% and 1.76%, respect ively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $4.2 billion at December 31, 2007, up $1.9 billion, or 81%, from the prior-year level of $2.3 billion. Noninterest expense was $10.7 billion, up $835 milli on, or 8%, from the prior year. Expense growth was driven by higher compensation expense and increased net litigation expense. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.4% at D ecember 31, 2007 (estimated), 8.4% at September 30, 2007, and 8.7% at December 31, 2006.  During the quarter, $163 million of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 3.6 million shares purchase d at an average price of $45.29 per share.  Headcount of 180,667 increased by 6,307 since December 31, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Other financial information • Merger savings and cost : For the quarter ended December 31, 2007 , approximately $750 million of merger savings have been realized, an annualized rate of $3.0 billion. Merger costs of $22 million were expensed during the fourth quar ter of 2007 and the total amount of merger costs incurred were $3.6 billion (including costs associated with the Bank of New York transaction and capitalized costs) since the beginning of 2004. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business’ results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP re sults and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs an d loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made ab out allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase re tains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; acco rdingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans report ed on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (fourth quarter of 2007) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
