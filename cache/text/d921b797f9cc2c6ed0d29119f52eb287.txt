(NYSE: JPM) today reported 2007 third- quarter net income of $3.4 billion, up from $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2006. Earnings per share of $0.97 were up 5%, compared with $0.92 per share in the third quarter of 2006. Commenting on the quarter, Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our firm performed well overall in the third quarter, despite challenging credit and market conditions. Asset Management and Treasury & Securities Services delivered record earnings, Card Services and Commercial Banking produced double-digit earnings growth, and Private Equity posted another quarter of strong gains. Investment banking is a volatile business, and while we would typically expect lower earnings in the Investment Bank during a difficult market environment, such as this one, we still believe that our performance could have been a bit better. Finally, Retail Financial Services had good revenue growth while further strengthening its reserves for home equity loan losses." Remarking further, Dimon said, "It is gratifying that even in this challenging environment, the firm generated record revenue, net income and earnings per share for a third-quarter and year-to-date, while maintaining a fortress balance sheet and improving the infrastructure of the firm. During the quarter, we did not lose focus on becoming more efficient, as we successfully completed the in- sourcing of our credit card processing platform and our conversion of the wholesale deposit system. The wholesale conversion -- the largest in the firm’s history and the last significant merger integration event -- affected approximately $180 billion in customer balances." Discussing the firm’s outlook, Dimon said, "We are comfortable that we are building an increasingly strong company, which can capitalize on opportunities in any environment, due to actions taken over the past few years, including: • Strengthening our levels of capital, reserves and liquidity. • Investing in all our businesses, which has: - strengthened the quality and diversity of earnings; and - improved our operating systems, cost structure and operating margins.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Dimon further added, "We remain cautious about the future economic environment, but will continue to make investments based upon the long-term outlook for market and client volumes. Our focus will be on investments in areas across our franchise, including the Investment Bank and the retail mortgage business, where we can wisely utilize our balance sheet to better serve our clients and gain market share in the process. I believe our firm is well positioned for the future." In the discussion below of the business segments and JPMorgan Chase, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 13). The following discussion compares the third quarter of 2007 with the third quarter of 2006 unless otherwise noted. INVESTMENT BANK (IB) Results for IB 2Q07 3Q06 ($ millions) 3Q07 2Q07 3Q06 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net Revenue $2,946 $5,798 $4,816 ($2,852) (49)% ($1,870) (39)% Provision for Credit Losses 227 164 7 63 38 220 NM Noninterest Expense 2,378 3,854 3,244 (1,476) (38) (866) (27) Net Income $296 $1,179 $976 ($883) (75)% ($680) (70)% Discussion of Results: Net income was $296 million, down by $680 million, or 70%, compared with the prior year. The decrease in earnings reflected lower net re venue as well as a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $2.9 billion, down by $1.9 billion, or 39%, from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.3 billion, down by 6% fr om the prior year, re flecting lower debt underwriting fees offset partially by record a dvisory fees. Debt underwriting fees were $468 million, down 34%, reflecting lower bond underwriting and loan syndication fees, which were negatively affected by market conditions. Advisory fees were $595 million, up 36%, driven by a strong performance across all regions. Equ ity underwriting fees were $267 million, down 3%, driven by lower revenue in Europe and Asia , partially offset by st rong performance in the Americas in common stock and convertible offerings. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $687 million, down by $1.8 billion, or 72%, from th e prior year. The decrease was primarily due to markdowns of $1.3 billion (net of fees) on leveraged lendi ng funded and unfunded commitments and markdowns of $339 million (net of hedges) on collateralized debt obligation (CDO) warehouses and unsold positions. Fixed Income Markets revenue also decreased due to very weak credit trading performance and signi ficantly lower commodities results, compared with a strong prior-year quarter. These lower re sults were offset partially by record revenue in both rates and currencies. Equity Markets revenue was $537 million, down 18% from the prior year, as weaker trading results were offset par tially by strong client re venue across businesses. Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets had a combined benefit of $454 million from the widening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, with an impact of $304 million and $150 million, respectively. Credit Portfolio revenue was $392 million, up 45% from the prior year, primarily due to higher tr ading revenue from hedging activities and gains from loan workouts. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 The provision for credit losses was $227 million, compared with $7 million in the prior year. The provision was up due to an increase in the allo wance for credit losses, primarily related to portfolio growth. Net charge-offs were $67 million, compared with net recoveries of $8 million in the prior year. The allowance for lo an losses to average loans retained was 1.80% for the current quarter an increase from 1.64% in the prior year. Nonperforming assets were $325 million, down 29% from the prior year and up 173% from the prior quarter. Average loans retained were $61.9 billion, up by $2.9 billion, or 5%, from the prior quarter. Average fair value and held-for-sale loans were $17.3 billion, up by $2.5 billion, or 17%, from the prior quarter. Fair value and held-for-sale loans at September 30, 2007, were $20.2 billion, up by $8.6 billion, or 76%, from the prior quarter. Both average and end-of-period fair value and held-for-sale loans reflect a net increase in third-quarter, 2007 leveraged lending activity. Noninterest expense was $2.4 billion, down by $866 million, or 27%, from the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to lower performance-based compensation. Highlights Include:  Ranked #1 in Global Equity and Equ ity-Related; #1 in Global Syndicated Loans; #4 in Global Announced M&A; #2 in Global Debt, Equity and Equity-Related; and #2 in Global Long-Term Debt, based upon volume, according to Thomson Financial for year-to-date September 30, 2007.  Return on equity was 6% on $21.0 billion of allocated capital.

Net revenue was $4.2 billion, up by $646 million, or 18%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $2.7 billion, up by $224 million, or 9%, due to the Bank of New York transaction, wider spreads on loans and higher deposit balances. These benefits were offset partially by a shift to narrower–spread deposit products. Noninterest reve nue was $1.5 billion, up by $422 million, or 38%, benefiting from the absence of a prior-year negative valuation adjustment to the MSR asset; increases in deposit-related fees; an increase in mortgage loan originations; a higher level of education loan sales; and in creased mortgage loan servicing revenue. Noninterest revenue also benefited from the Bank of New York transaction and the classification of certain mortgage loan origin ation costs as expense (loan origination costs previously netted against revenue commenced being recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2007 due to the adoption of SFAS 159 (“Fair Va lue Option”)). These benefits were offset partially by markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 The provision for credit losses was $680 million, compared with $114 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision includes a net in crease of $306 million in the allowance for loan losses related to home equity loans as continued weak housing prices have resulted in an increase in estimated losses for high loan-to-va lue loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $150 million (0.65% net charge-off rate), comp ared with $29 million (0.15% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. In addi tion, the current-quarter provision includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses, reflecting increased loan balances resulting from the decision to retain rather than sell subprim e mortgage loans. Subprime mort gage net charge-offs were $40 million (1.62% net charge-off rate), compared with $13 million (0.36% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.5 billion, up by $330 million, or 15%, due to the Bank of New York transaction, the classifica tion of certain loan origination costs as expense due to the adoption of SFAS 159, investments in the retail distribution networ k and an increase in loan originations in Mortgage Banking. Regional Banking net income was $611 million, down by $133 million, or 18%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $3.3 billion, up by $376 million, or 13%, benefiting from the following: the Bank of New York transaction; in creases in deposit-relate d fees; a higher level of education loan sales; growth in deposits and wi der loan spreads. These benefits were offset partially by a shift to narrower– spread deposit products. The provision for credit losses was $574 million, compared with $53 million in the prio r year. The increase in provision was due to the home equity and subprime mortgage portfo lios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of provision for credit losses for further deta il). Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up by $149 million, or 9%, from the prior year due to the Bank of New York transaction and investments in the retail distribution network. Highlights Include:  Checking accounts totaled 10.6 million, up by 1.4 million, or 15%, from the prior year (including approximate ly 615,000 accounts acquired from The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006).  Average total deposits increased to $205.3 billion, up by $17.9 billion, or 10%, from the prior year (including approximately $11.5 billion of deposits acquired from The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006).  Average home equity loans of $91.8 billion were up from $78.8 billion in the prior year.  Business Banking loan originations of $1.7 billion were up 19% from the prior year.  Number of branches increased to 3,096, up by 419 from the prior year (including 339 acquired from The Bank of New York).  Branch sales of credit cards increased 59% from the prior year.  Branch sales of investment products increased 23% from the prior year.  Overhead ratio (excluding amortizat ion of core deposit intangibles) decreased to 49% from 51% in the prior year. Mortgage Banking net loss was $48 million, compared with a net loss of $83 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $406 milli on, up by $208 million. Net revenue comprises production revenue and net mortgage serv icing revenue. Production revenue was $176 million, down by $21 million, as markdowns of $186 million on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline were offset partially by an increase in mortgage loan originations and the classification of certain loan origination cost s as expense (loan origination costs previously netted against JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 revenue commenced being recorded as an expe nse in the first quart er of 2007 due to the adoption of SFAS 159). Net mortgage servici ng revenue, which incl udes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and ot her changes in fair value, was $230 million, compared with $1 million in the prior year. Loan servicing revenue of $629 million increased by $50 million on growth of 17% in third-part y loans serviced. MSR risk management revenue of negative $22 million improved by $229 m illion, due primarily to the absence of a prior-year negative valuation adjustment of $23 5 million to the MSR asset. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, representing run-off of the asset against the realization of servicing cash flows, were negative $377 million, compared with negative $327 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $485 million, up by $151 m illion, or 45%. The increase reflected the classification of certain loan origination costs due to th e adoption of SFAS 159, and higher compensation expense, the result of higher loan originations and a greater number of loan officers. Highlights Include:  Mortgage loan originations were $39.2 billion, up by 35%, from the prior year and down 11% from the prior quarter.  Total third-party mortgage loans serv iced were $600.0 billion, an increase of $89.3 billion, or 17%, from the prior year. Auto Finance net income was $76 million, down by $9 mill ion, or 11%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $447 million, up by $52 million, or 13%, reflecting higher automobile operating lease revenue and wider loan spreads. The provision for credit losses was $96 million, an increase of $35 million, reflecting an increase in estimated losses from low prior- year levels. Noninterest expense of $224 m illion increased by $30 million, or 15%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Highlights Include:  Auto loan originations were $5.2 b illion, down by 5%, compared with the prior year.  Average loan receivables were $39.9 b illion, up by 3%, compared with the prior year.  The net charge-off ratio increased to 0.97% from 0.64% in the prior year.

Earnings benefited from higher revenue offset partially by an increase in the provision for credit losses. End-of-period managed loans of $149.1 billion increased by $5.2 billion, or 4%, from the prior year and by $1.1 billion, or 1%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans of $148.7 billion increased by $7.0 billion, or 5%, from th e prior year and by $1.2 billion, or 1%, from JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 the prior quarter. Both end-of-period and av erage managed loans benefited from organic growth. Net managed revenue was $3.9 billion, up by $221 m illion, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.1 billion, up by $224 milli on, or 8%, from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was driven by an incr eased level of fees an d higher average loan balances. These benefits were offset partially by the discontinuation of certain billing practices (including the elimination of certain over-lim it fees and the two-cycle billing method for calculating finance charges) and a narrower loan spread. Noninterest revenue was $759 million, flat compared with the prior year. In creased net interchange income, which benefited from higher charge volume, was offset by lowe r net securitization gains. Charge volume growth of 3% reflects an appr oximate 10% growth rate in sale s volume, offset primarily by a lower level of balance transfers, the result of a more targeted marketing effort. The managed provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, up by $93 million, or 7%, from the prior year due to a higher level of net charge-offs. Credit quality was stable in the quarter, with a managed net charge-off rate for the quarter of 3.64%, up from 3.58% in the prior year and 3.62% in the prior quart er. The 30-day managed delinqu ency rate was 3.25%, up from 3.17% in the prior year and 3.00% in the prior quarter.

The increase was driven by double-digit growth in liability and loan balances, reflec ting organic growth and the Bank of New York transaction, partially offset by a continued shift to narrower –spread liability products and spread compression in the loan and liability portfolios. Noninterest revenue was $290 million, up by $34 million, or 13%, primarily due to higher deposit-related fees and other income. Middle Market Banking revenue was $680 million, an increase of $63 million, or 10%, from the prior year, due to the Bank of New York transaction, higher depo sit-related fees, and growth in investment banking revenue.

Prior-ye ar results also included net income from discontinued operations of $65 million. Net revenue was $1.0 billion, compared with $289 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by Private Equity gains of $766 millio n, compared with $226 million, reflecting a higher level of gains and the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense. Net revenue also increa sed due to higher trading-related gains and a $115 million gain from the sale of MasterCard shares. The increase in revenue was offset partially by a narrower net interest spread. Noninterest expense was $245 million, down by $236 million from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower compensation e xpense and continuing business efficiencies. Partially offsetting the benefit of lower expense was the impact of the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense. Highlights Include:  Private Equity portfolio was $6.6 b illion, up from $5.6 billion in the prior year and $6.5 billion in the prior quarter. The portfolio represented 8.8% of stockholders’ equity less goodwill, up from 8.0% in the prior year and unchanged from the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue on a GAAP basis w as $16,112 million, $18,908 million and $15,545 million for the third quarter of 2007, second quarter of 2007 and third quarter of 2006, respectively. (b) Discontinued operations include the income statement activity of selected corporat e trust businesses sold to The Bank of Ne w York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Treasury & Securities Services. Discussion of Results: Net income was a record $3.4 billion, up by $76 milli on from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by record net managed revenue and lowe r noninterest expense, largely offset by higher managed provision for credit loss. Net managed revenue was $17.0 billion, up by $603 million, or 4%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $8.1 b illion was down by $1.5 billion, or 15%, reflecting markdowns on leveraged lending funded a nd unfunded commitments and lo wer fixed income trading results. These decreases were offset partiall y by increased asset mana gement, administration, and commissions revenue, which benefited from a higher level of assets under management and by strong private equity gains. Net intere st income was $8.8 billion, up by $2.1 billion, or 31%, due to trading net interest income; growth in liability and deposit balances, primarily in the wholesale businesses; a higher level of cred it card loans and fees; and the impact of the Bank of New York transaction. These increases were offset partially by a narrower net interest spread in the Corporate segment and a shift to narrower–spread deposit products. The managed provision for credit losses was $2.4 billion, up by $944 million, or 67%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for cr edit losses was $351 million, compared with $35 million, reflecting an increase in the allowance fo r credit losses, primarily related to portfolio growth. Wholesale net charge -offs were $82 million, compared with net recoveries of $11 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.18% and (0.03)%, respectively. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the a llowance for credit losses, largely related to home equity loans, and higher net charge-offs. Consumer managed net charge-offs were $1.7 billion, compared with $1.4 billion, re sulting in managed net char ge-off rates of 1.96% and 1.69%, respectively. The firm had total nonperfor ming assets of $3.2 billion at September 30, 2007, up by $881 million, or 38%, from the prior-year level of $2.3 billion. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 Noninterest expense was $9.3 billion, down by $469 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Expense decreased due to lower compensation expense, primarily performance-based, partially offset by investments across businesses and acquisitions. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.4% at Se ptember 30, 2007 (estimated), 8.4% at June 30, 2007, and 8.6% at September 30, 2006.  During the quarter, $2.1 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 47.0 million shares purchase d at an average price of $45.42 per share.  Headcount of 179,847 increased by 8,258 since September 30, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Other financial information • Merger savings and cost: For the quarter ended September 30, 200 7, approximately $740 million of merger savings have been realized, an annu alized rate of $2.96 billion. Management estimates that annualized savings will be approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007. Merger costs of $61 million were expensed during the third quarter of 2007, bringing the total amount of merger costs incurred to $3.7 billion (including capitalized costs) since the beginning of 2004. Management currently expects total merger costs (including costs associated with the Bank of New York transactio n) will be approximately $3.8 billion. The remaining merger costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2007. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business’ results on a managed basis, which is a no n-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans record ed on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase re tains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; acco rdingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans a nd the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans report ed on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allo ws management to assess the compar ability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third quarter of 2007) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
