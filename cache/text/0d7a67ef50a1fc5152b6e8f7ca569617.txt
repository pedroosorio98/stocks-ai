Cayman Islands &nbsp; Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position of Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as at June 30, 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income or loss for the three and six-month periods then ended, changes in equity and cash flows for the six-month period then ended, and notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo; issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review. &nbsp; Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with Brazilian and International Standards on Review (NBC TR 2410 - Revis&atilde;o de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Intermedi&aacute;rias Executada pelo Auditor da Entidade and ISRE 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity , respectively). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2023, are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo;. &nbsp; &nbsp; S&atilde;o Paulo, August 15, 2023. &nbsp; &nbsp; KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; &#9679; Nu Colombia S.A. (&#8220;Nu Colombia&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Colombia, with operations related to credit cards, which was launched in September 2020. On August 10, 2022, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (&quot;SFC&quot;) approved the Group's request to incorporate a financing company in Colombia, Nu Colombia Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Financiamiento S.A (&quot;Nu Colombia Financiamiento&quot;) (&quot;Incorporation License&quot;). Nu Colombia Financiamiento requested the license to operate as a financial company, which is still pending approval. If the request is approved, it will enable Nu Colombia to offer deposit products in the future, amongst other financial products. &nbsp; The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as the &#8220;Group&#8221; or &quot;Nu&#8221;. The business plan of Nu provides for the continued growth of its Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian operations, not only related to existing businesses, such as credit cards, personal loans, investments, and insurance, but also complemented by the launch of new products. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption of the Group continuing as a going concern. The business is affected by customer behavior throughout the year and demonstrates seasonality effects. Historically, the Group benefited from a higher volume of transactions and related revenue in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. However, the growth has masked this seasonality in the past, and this may become more pronounced in the future. The Company&#8217;s Board authorized the issuance of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements on August 15, 2023. a) Level III BDR Program discontinuation On June 28, 2023 the CVM Collegiate approved the plan for the discontinuance of the Company's Level III BDRs Program and the cancellation of the Company's registration with the CVM as a foreign public issuer of category &quot;A&quot; securities. The plan provides that the current holders of the BDRs must decide during a 30-day period, from July 13, 2023 to August 11, 2023 (&quot;Choice Period&quot;), between: (i) remaining as the Company&#8217;s shareholder through the receipt of class A ordinary shares traded on the NYSE; (ii) remaining as holders of the Company's BDRs through the receipt of Unsponsored Level I BDRs; or (iii) if no declaration is made, the Company will sell the underlying shares on NYSE and former holders will receive the equivalent amount. b) Nucoin In February 2023, Nu initiated the distribution of Nucoin, which is the native crypto token issued from Nu that enables the loyalty network (&quot;Nucoin Network&quot;) between Nu and its customers. Over time, Nu aims to have other sponsoring companies (&#8220;Sponsors&#8221;) that commit to use Nucoin as their loyalty program. These Sponsors will be entitled to a certain number of Nucoins to distribute to their customers, and will be required to offer benefits to Nucoins&#8217; holders to incentivize the network adoption and increase the overall utility to the community. &nbsp; 13 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE &nbsp; These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&quot;IFRS&#8221;) as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;IASB&#8221;). However, selected condensed explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to understanding the changes in the Company&#8217;s financial position and performance since the issuance of its last annual financial statements. The Group&#8217;s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting issued by IASB. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the &quot;Annual Financial Statements&#8221;). a) Functional currency and foreign currency translation The presentation of the functional currency and foreign currency translation disclosed in note 2a. of the Annual Financial Statements remain valid for these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The functional currency for Nu Holdings and the presentation currency of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollars (&#8220;US$&#8221;). The functional currency of the Brazilian operating entities is the Brazilian real, for the Mexican entities, Mexican peso and for the Colombian entity, the Colombian peso. The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries held in functional currencies that are not US$ are translated into US$, and the exchange differences arising from the translation to US$ of the financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than the US$ are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or loss (OCI) as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss within &#8220;currency translation on foreign entities&#8221;. b) New or revised accounting pronouncements adopted in 2023 The following new or revised standards have been issued by IASB, were effective for the period covered by these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and had no significant impact. &#9679; Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2); &#9679; Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8); and &#9679; Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12). c) Other new standards and interpretations not yet effective &#9679; Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1). &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; Management does not expect the adoption of the amendments described above to have a significant impact, other than additional disclosures, on the consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; 3. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION &nbsp; These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounting balances of Nu Holdings and all those subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, directly or indirectly. Control is achieved where the Company has (i) power over the investee; (ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) can use its power to affect its profits. The Company re-assesses whether it maintains control of an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three above mentioned elements of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over it and ceases when the Company loses control over it. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. The financial information of the subsidiaries was prepared in the same period as the Company and consistent accounting policies were applied. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Company. Accordingly, all balances, transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising between consolidated entities are eliminated in the consolidation, except for foreign-currency gain and losses on translation of intercompany loans. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income or loss are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, when applicable. The subsidiaries below are the most relevant entities included in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements: Entity &nbsp; Control &nbsp; Principal activities &nbsp; Functional currency &nbsp; Country &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 Nu Colombia S.A.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Name of the entity &nbsp; Country Fundo de Investimento Ostrum Soberano Renda Fixa Referenciado DI (&#8220;Fundo Ostrum&#8221;) &nbsp; Brazil Nu Pagamentos, Nu Financeira, Nu DTVM and Nu Invest, Brazilian subsidiaries, are regulated by the Brazilian Central Bank (&#8220;BACEN&#8221;), Nu M&eacute;xico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P. (&quot;Nu Financiera&quot;), a Mexican subsidiary, is regulated by both the Mexican Central Bank (&quot;BANXICO&quot;) and Mexican National Banking and Stock Commission (&#8220;CNBV&#8221;) and Nu Colombia, a Colombian subsidiary, is regulated by Industry and Commerce Superintendency, and as such, there are some regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from these entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. &nbsp; 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES &nbsp; The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements and therefore should be read in conjunction. &nbsp; 5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS &nbsp; Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires judgments, estimates, and assumptions from management that affect the application of accounting policies, and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to the estimates are recognized prospectively. The significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 were the same as those adopted in the Annual Financial Statements. Credit losses on financial instruments The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on credit cards and loans receivables that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of allowance as of each reporting date. Management performs an analysis of the credit card and loan amounts to determine if credit losses have occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. Key areas of judgment The critical judgments made by management in applying the expected credit losses (&quot;ECL&quot;) allowance methodology are: a) Definition of default; b) Forward-looking information used for the projection of macroeconomic scenarios; c) Probability weights of future scenarios; d) Definition of significant increase in credit risk and lifetime; and &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; e) Look-back period, used for parameters estimation (probability of default - PD, exposure at default - EAD and loss given default - LGD). Sensitivity analysis On June 30, 2023, the probability weighted ECL allowance totaled US$2,032,872 of which US$1,674,271 related to credit card operations and US$358,601 to loans. The ECL allowance is sensitive to the methodology, assumptions and estimations underlying its calculation. One key assumption is the probability weighting of the macroeconomic scenarios between upside, base and downside as the carrying amount of the credit loss allowance is determined based on the weighted average of these scenarios. The table below illustrates the ECL that would have arisen if management had applied a 100% weighting to each macroeconomic scenario. &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighted average &nbsp; Upside &nbsp; Base case &nbsp; Downside &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card and lending ECL &nbsp; 2,032,872 &nbsp; 1,896,834 &nbsp; 2,004,368 &nbsp; 2,200,655 &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.

Receivables - installments&#8221; is related to purchases in installments. Credit card receivables can be paid by our clients in up to 12, 24 and 36 monthly installments in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, respectively. The cardholder&#8217;s credit limit is initially reduced by the total amount and the installments become due and payable on the cardholder's subsequent monthly credit card statement. Brazil makes the corresponding payments to the credit card network (see note 22) following a similar schedule. As receipts and payments are aligned, the Group does not incur significant financing costs with this product, however it is exposed to the credit risk of the cardholder as it is obliged to make the payments to the credit card network even if the cardholder does not pay. &#8220;Receivables - installments&#8221; also includes the amounts of credit card bills not fully paid by the customers and that have been converted into payments in installments with a fixed interest rate (&quot; fatura parcelada&quot; ), in addition to bill financing, which comprise bills paid in installments through the credit card, banking payment slips (&quot; boleto &quot;) and PIX financing in more than one installment. (ii) &quot;Receivables - revolving&quot; is related to the amounts due from customers that have not paid in full their credit card bill. Customers may request to convert these receivables into loans to be paid in installments. In accordance with Brazilian regulation, revolving balances that are outstanding for more than 2 months are mandatorily converted into fatura parcelada - a type of installment loan which is settled through the customer&#8217;s monthly credit card bills . &nbsp; 26 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, and is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored, to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. All receivables are classified through stages, where: (i) stage 1 include all receivables not classified in stages 2 and 3; (ii) stage 2 is primarily related to all receivables more than 30 (thirty), but less than 90 (ninety), days in arrears, or with an increase in client's behavior risk score compared to the time of the origination; and (iii) stage 3 when receivables are more than 90 (ninety) days in arrears, or there are indications that the financial asset will not be fully paid without a collateral or financial guarantee. The majority of the Group's credit card portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 3 exposures increased to 7.7% on June 30, 2023 from 6.5% on December 31, 2022. The stage 3 movement is primarily due to credit expansions done in the past which are maturing in the portfolio, as well as increases in early delinquency observed in the previous quarters. &nbsp; 27 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, which is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored, to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. All receivables are classified through stages. The explanation of each stage is set out in the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, as disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022. The majority of the Group's loans to customers&#8217; portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 1 exposures remained stable, at 76.4% on June 30, 2023 compared to 77.0% on December 31, 2022. The stage 1 coverage ratio movement is primarily due to the growth of the portfolio due to origination into lower risk segments. &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Exposures &nbsp; % &nbsp; Credit Loss Allowance &nbsp; % &nbsp; Coverage Ratio Stage 1 &nbsp; 2,131,969 &nbsp; 76.4% &nbsp; 80,338 &nbsp; 22.4% &nbsp; 3.8% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 2 &nbsp; 512,046 &nbsp; 18.3% &nbsp; 176,052 &nbsp; 49.1% &nbsp; 34.4% Absolute Trigger (Days Late) &nbsp; 99,358 &nbsp; 19.4% &nbsp; 82,826 &nbsp; 47.0% &nbsp; 83.4% Relative Trigger (PD deterioration) &nbsp; 412,688 &nbsp; 80.6% &nbsp; 93,226 &nbsp; 53.0% &nbsp; 22.6% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 3 &nbsp; 147,803 &nbsp; 5.3% &nbsp; 102,211 &nbsp; 28.5% &nbsp; 69.1% Total &nbsp; 2,791,818 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 358,601 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 12.8% &nbsp; 32 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS &nbsp; The Group executes transactions with derivative financial instruments, which are intended to meet its own needs to reduce its exposure to market, currency and interest-rate risks. The derivatives are classified at fair value through profit or loss, except those in cash flow hedge accounting strategies, for which the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives is recognized directly in other comprehensive income (loss). The management of these risks is conducted through determining limits, and the establishment of operating strategies. The derivative contracts are considered level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are used to hedge exposures, but hedge accounting is adopted only for forecasted transactions related to the cloud infrastructure and certain software licenses used by Nu (hedge of foreign currency risk), to hedge interest of the fixed rate credit portfolio (hedge of interest rate risk of portfolio) and to hedge the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting or SOP exercise, as shown below. &nbsp; 38 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; Nu Holdings entered into non-deliverable forward contracts to hedge intercompany loans with Nu Colombia in U.S. Dollars with a settlement in December 2023. Swap TRS contracts are settled only at maturity and are traded over the counter with financial institutions as counterparties. (i) Warrants In September 2021, Nu entered into an agreement with Creditas Financial Solutions Ltd. (and/or its affiliates in Latin America, or together, &#8220;Creditas&#8221;) through which Nu will distribute certain financial products offered by Creditas to its customers in Latin America. These include affordable retail collateralized loans, such as home and auto equity loans, auto financing, motorcycle financing and payroll loans. The agreement also provided that Nu would invest in Creditas&#8217; securitization vehicles, becoming the holder of the senior quotas of the fund. As of June 30, 2023 the Company had a total of US$78,229 (US$248,181 as of December 31, 2022) invested in Creditas&#8217; securitization vehicles presented as FVTOCI. In addition, Nu was granted warrants that provide the right to acquire an equity interest equivalent to up to 7.7% of Creditas, on a fully diluted basis, under a pre-agreed valuation, proportional to fifty percent of the amount invested in the securitization vehicles and products distributed. The notional amount of the warrants is US$100,000 and is presented in the table above. Nu can exercise the warrants at any time, but the expiration date is 2 years after the issuance date. As of June 30, 2023, the warrants' fair value was US$6,188 (US$27,908 as of December 31, 2022) calculated using a Black Scholes model, classified as level 3 on the fair value hierarchy, as shown in note 28. The Company recognized a fair value loss of US$21,710 during the six-month period ended June 30, 2023. The reduction in the warrant&#8217;s fair value resulted from updates in the assumptions used in the related option pricing model, including the reduction in the remaining exercise period of the warrants, which expire in September 2023. &nbsp; 40 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Analysis of derivatives designated as hedges a) Hedge of foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on forecast transaction expenses, primarily related to the cloud infrastructure and certain software licenses used by Nu. The Group managed its exposures to the variability in cash flows of foreign currency forecasted transactions to movements in foreign exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange contracts (exchange futures). These instruments are entered into to match the cash flow profile of the estimated forecast transactions, and are exchange-traded and fair value movements are settled on a daily basis. The Group applies hedge accounting to the forecasted transactions related to its main cloud infrastructure contract and other expenses in foreign currency. The effectiveness is assessed monthly by analyzing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the amount of the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. Derivatives are generally rolled over monthly. They are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedging instrument. Therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transaction have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective. Sources of ineffectiveness are differences in the amount and timing of forecast and actual payment of expenses. &nbsp; &nbsp; Six-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; (2,610) &nbsp; 1,487 Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; (24,336) &nbsp; (12,737) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period &nbsp; 10,664 &nbsp; 4,585 to &quot;Customer support and operation&quot; &nbsp; 8,642 &nbsp; 2,287 to &quot;General and administrative expenses&quot; &nbsp; 2,667 &nbsp; 2,470 Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; (645) &nbsp; (172) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deferred income taxes &nbsp; 5,382 &nbsp; 3,268 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at end of the period &nbsp; (10,900) &nbsp; (3,397) The future transactions that are the object of the hedge are: &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to 3 months &nbsp; 3 to 12 months &nbsp; Total &nbsp; Total Expected foreign currency transactions &nbsp; 55,535 &nbsp; 169,445 &nbsp; 224,980 &nbsp; 129,459 Total &nbsp; 55,535 &nbsp; 169,445 &nbsp; 224,980 &nbsp; 129,459 &nbsp; 43 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; b) Hedge of portfolio's interest rate risk The Group holds portfolios of customer loan and refinancing of credit cards receivables at fixed interest rates, in its banking book which are exposed to interest rate risk. To hedge this risk, the Group entered into DI futures contracts, and applied hedge accounting aiming to eliminate differences between the accounting measurement of its derivatives and hedged items. The Group&#8217;s overall hedging strategy is to reduce fair value changes of the part of the fixed rate portfolio as if they were floating rate instruments linked to the attributable benchmark rates. As such, in order to reflect the dynamic nature of the hedged portfolio, the strategy is to rebalance the DI future contracts and evaluate the allocated amount by the credit portfolio. Additionally, ineffectiveness could arise from the disparity between expected and actual prepayments (prepayment risk). In accordance with its hedging strategy, the Group calculates the DV01 (delta value of a basis point ) of the exposure and futures to identify the optimal hedging ratio, and monitors in a timely manner the hedge relationship, providing any rebalancing if needed. The need for the purchase or sale of new DI future contracts will be assessed, to counterbalance the hedged item&#8217;s fair value adjustment, aiming to assure hedge effectiveness between 80% and 125%, as determined on hedge documentation. The effectiveness test for the hedge is done on a prospective and retrospective basis. In the prospective test, the Group compares the impact of a 1 basis point parallel shift on the interest rate curve (DV01) on the hedged object and on the hedge instrument fair value . For the retrospective test, the fair value change since the inception of the hedged object is compared to the hedge instrument. In both cases, the hedge is considered effective if the correlation is between 80% and 125%. As of June 30, 2023 the effectiveness ratio for the hedges of the credit card and loan portfolios were 100% and 99%, respectively. For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in &quot;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments - financial assets at fair value&quot;. In addition, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The derivative financial instruments used to cover the exposure are total return swaps (&quot;TRS&quot;) in which one leg is indexed to the Company's stock price and the other leg is indexed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&quot;SOFR&quot;) plus spread. The stock fixed at the TRS is a weighted average price. The hedge was entered into by Nu Holdings and therefore there is no income tax effect. &nbsp; 44 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; The Group applies the cash flow hedge for the hedge structure thus the market risk is replaced by an interest rate risk. The effectiveness assessment is performed monthly by (i) assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) monitoring the credit risk impact in the hedge effectiveness; and (iii) maintaining and updating the hedging ratio. Given the possibility of forfeiture impacting the future cash forecast of the employee benefit plan, the Group manages exposures to keep the hedging level within an acceptable coverage. The derivative fair value is measured substantially based on the stock price which is also used in the measurement of the provision or payment for corporate and social security taxes. There is no expectation for a mismatch between the hedged item and hedging instrument at maturity other than the SOFR. &nbsp; &nbsp; Six-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; (4,876) &nbsp; - Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; 40,021 &nbsp; (13,507) Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period (i) &nbsp; (26,087) &nbsp; 1,290 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at end of the period &nbsp; 9,058 &nbsp; (12,217) (i) Presented as share-based compensation in general and administrative expenses.

As a prepaid account, the amounts deposited by customers are classified as electronic money and must be fully allocated to government securities, in accordance with Brazilian regulatory requirements (see note 12b). Therefore, this type of deposit cannot be used for any other type of investment or as a financing source for credit operations. In June 2019, Nu Financeira&#8217;s RDBs were included as an investment option inside &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot;. Deposits in RDB have guarantees from the Brazilian Deposit Guarantee Fund (&#8220;FGC&#8221;). Unlike the deposits in electronic money, after the compulsory deposits requirements (see note 15), Nu is not required to invest the remaining resources from RDB deposits in government securities, the balance can be used as a financing source for lending and credit card operations. The return from both electronic money and RDB deposits is 100% of the Brazilian CDI rate as of the initial date, if the balances are kept for more than 30 days. Nu also offers the &quot;Money Boxes&quot; option, in which RDBs generate daily yield as of the deposit date. All of those deposits have daily liquidity. In September 2020, Nu Financeira launched a new investment option &#8211; a RDB with a defined future maturity date. These RDBs had maturities of up to 27 months and a weighted average interest rate of 104.5% as of June 30, 2023 (104% on December 31, 2022) of the Brazilian CDI rate. &nbsp; 46 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; Currently, deposits in electronic money in Brazil include &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot; and also &quot;Conta NuInvest&quot; balances, the latter corresponding to on-demand deposits of the Groups&#8217; investment brokerage clients, with the same characteristics described above. In Mexico, there is no requirement to invest &quot;CuentaNu&quot; deposits, as it is locally denominated, in specific assets. Therefore, they can be used as a financing source for the credit card operations, and the return is the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate &quot;TIIE&quot; -2.5%, as of June 30, 2023.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; a) Provision A provision in the amount of US$15,747 on December 31, 2022 referred to a potential legal obligation related to the increase in the contribution of certain Brazilian taxes (PIS and COFINS). The Group had a judicial deposit related to this claim, and in June 2019, Nu withdrew the lawsuit. The release of the judicial deposits in favor of the Brazilian Tax Authorities occurred in May 2023, representing final settlement of the matter with the consequent use of the provisioned amount. Civil lawsuits are mainly related to credit card operations. Based on management&#8217;s assessment and inputs from Nu&#8217;s external legal advisors, the Group has provisioned US$4,522 (US$2,096 on December 31, 2022) considered sufficient to cover estimated losses from civil suits deemed probable. b) Changes Changes to provision for lawsuits and administrative proceedings are as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Tax &nbsp; Civil &nbsp; Labor &nbsp; Tax &nbsp; Civil &nbsp; Labor &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; 15,747 &nbsp; 2,096 &nbsp; 104 &nbsp; 17,081 &nbsp; 980 &nbsp; 21 Additions &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6,170 &nbsp; 135 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 980 &nbsp; 11 Payments / Reversals &nbsp; (16,402) &nbsp; (4,085) &nbsp; (119) &nbsp; (2,382) &nbsp; (553) &nbsp; (14) Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; 655 &nbsp; 341 &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; 1,119 &nbsp; 43 &nbsp; 2 Balance at end of the period &nbsp; - &nbsp; 4,522 &nbsp; 131 &nbsp; 15,818 &nbsp; 1,450 &nbsp; 20 c) Contingencies The Group is a party to civil and labor lawsuits, involving risks classified by management and the legal advisors as possible losses, totaling approximately US$11,222 and US$2,894, respectively (US$7,128 and US$1,814 on December 31, 2022). Based on management&#8217;s assessment and inputs from the Group&#8217;s external legal advisors, no provision was recognized for those lawsuits as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the total amount of judicial deposits shown as &#8220;Other assets&#8221; (note 17) is US$3,288 (US$18,864 on December 31, 2022) and is substantially attributed to the&#9;judicial deposit carried on behalf of the shareholders of Nu Invest, prior to the acquisition, due to a tax proceeding related to withholding taxes inappropriately deducted from amounts paid to employees. &nbsp; &nbsp; 25.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; Deferred revenue from rewards programs is related to the Group's reward program for its credit card customers, called &quot;Rewards&quot;. The program consists of accumulating points according to the use of the credit card in the ratio of R$1.00 (one Brazilian real, equivalent to US$0.21 as of June 30, 2023 US$0.19 as of December 31, 2022) equal to 1 point and cashbacks. The points do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of Rewards an eligible card member can earn. Deferred annual fees from the reward program comprise amounts related to the rewards fees which are paid annually by customers until they are earned. The redemption of the points occurs when the customers use them in various purchase categories, such as air tickets, hotels, transportation services, and music. Nu uses financial models to estimate the redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members, and, therefore, the estimated financial value of the points, based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, among others. The estimated financial value is recorded in the profit or loss when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is when the reward points are redeemed. &nbsp; &nbsp; 26.

RELATED PARTIES In the ordinary course of business, the Group may have issued credit cards or loans to Nu&#8217;s executive directors, board members, key employees and close family members. Those transactions, as well as the deposits and other products, such as investments, occur on similar terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. As described in note 3, &quot;Basis of consolidation&quot;, all companies from the Group are consolidated in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, related party balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. In 2023, the exchange differences arising from intercompany loans between entities of the group with different functional currencies are shown as &#8220;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments&#8221; in the statement of profit (loss). &nbsp; 52 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

On June 30, 2021, the Group entered into a service and naming rights agreement with Rodamoinho Produtora de Eventos Ltda., owned by a former member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (&quot;Board&quot;). This director has not been a member of the Board since September 2022, when the Company ceased recognizing Rodamoinho as a related party. In addition, the Group did not make payments for Reprograma, a philanthropic project managed by a family member of the Company&#8217;s controlling shareholder, in the six-month period ended June 30, 2023. &nbsp; &nbsp; 28. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT &nbsp; The main valuation techniques employed in internal models to measure the fair value of the financial instruments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are set out below. The principal inputs into these models are derived from observable market data. The Group did not make any material changes to its valuation techniques and internal models in those periods. a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost The following tables show the fair value of the financial instruments carried at amortized cost as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments such as compulsory and other deposits at central banks, other financial assets, deposits in electronic money, RDB, and borrowings and financing, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. &nbsp; 53 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The book value from credit card receivables and loans to customers includes the amounts that are the hedge items of the portfolio hedge, described in note 19. The credit risk components for both receivables are not part of the hedge strategy. Borrowings and financing fair value is equal to the book value given that any prepayment shall be equal to the total outstanding amount. The fair value of floating rate demand deposits are assumed to be equal to carrying amounts. The valuation approach to specific categories of financial instruments is described below. i) Fair value models and inputs Credit card: The fair values of credit card receivables and payables to network are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Fair values are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. For payables, cash flows are also discounted by the Group's own credit spread. Loans to customers: Fair value is estimated based on groups of clients with similar risk profiles, using valuation models. The fair value of a loan is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. Other receivables: Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows by a risk free interest rate and a credit spread. &nbsp; 54 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Therefore, all the government bonds and some corporate bonds are included in level 1 as they are traded in active markets. Brazilian securities values are the published prices by the 'Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais' (&quot;Anbima&quot;). For US and Mexico bonds, fair values are the published prices by Bloomberg. Other corporate bonds and investment fund shares, the valuation of which is based on observable data, such as interest rates and interest rate curves are classified as level 2. Derivatives: Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified as level 1 of the hierarchy. Derivatives traded on the Brazilian stock exchange are fairly valued using B3 quotations. Interest rate OTC Swaps are valued by discounting future expected cash flows to present values using interest rate curves and are classified as level 2. The embedded derivative conversion feature from the senior preferred share was calculated based on methodologies for the share price described in note 10. The options related to the warrant from Creditas Partnership are fair valued using a Black-Scholes model and are classified as level 3. Equity instrument: For the fair value of the equity instrument, the Group used contractual conditions as inputs that are not directly observable, and therefore it is classified as level 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; 56 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; Instruments eligible as capital: If the instrument has an active market, prices quoted in this market are used. Otherwise, valuation techniques are used, such as discounted cash flows, where cash flows are discounted by a risk-free rate and a credit spread. Instruments eligible as capital were designated at fair value through profit (loss) in the initial recognition (fair value option). Repurchase agreements: The fair value is the transaction value itself given that repurchase agreement is a collateralized short-term one day agreement. &nbsp; c) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels 1 and 2 or between levels 2 and 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; 29. INCOME TAX &nbsp; Current and deferred taxes are determined for all transactions that have been recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the current tax laws. The current income tax expense or benefit represents the estimated taxes to be paid or refunded, respectively, for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary tax differences are expected to reverse. a) Income tax reconciliation The tax on the Group's pre-tax profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities. Thus, the following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to profit (loss) for the period, calculated by applying the combined Brazilian income tax rate o f 40% for the three and six-month periods ended June 30 , 2023 and 2022: &nbsp; &nbsp; Three-month period ended &nbsp; Six-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 06/30/2022 Profit (loss) before income tax &nbsp; 323,977 &nbsp; (24,612) &nbsp; 567,606 &nbsp; (92,263) Tax rate (i) &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% Income tax &nbsp; (129,590) &nbsp; 9,845 &nbsp; (227,042) &nbsp; 36,905 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Permanent additions/exclusions &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Share-based payments &nbsp; 6,312 &nbsp; 9,922 &nbsp; (205) &nbsp; (985) Operational losses and others &nbsp; (378) &nbsp; (2,777) &nbsp; (4,190) &nbsp; (4,978) Foreign exchange variation on investments abroad &nbsp; (1,694) &nbsp; (3,974) &nbsp; 83 &nbsp; - Effect of different tax rates - subsidiaries and parent company &nbsp; 18,731 &nbsp; (17,764) &nbsp; 22,113 &nbsp; (12,792) Other non-deductible expenses &nbsp; 7,508 &nbsp; (490) &nbsp; 8,252 &nbsp; (741) Income tax &nbsp; (99,111) &nbsp; (5,238) &nbsp; (200,989) &nbsp; 17,409 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current tax expense &nbsp; (263,071) &nbsp; (96,249) &nbsp; (468,935) &nbsp; (195,301) Deferred tax benefit &nbsp; 163,960 &nbsp; 91,011 &nbsp; 267,946 &nbsp; 212,710 Income tax in the statement of profit or loss &nbsp; (99,111) &nbsp; (5,238) &nbsp; (200,989) &nbsp; 17,409 Deferred tax recognized in OCI &nbsp; 1,378 &nbsp; (1,849) &nbsp; 4,589 &nbsp; 221 &nbsp; &nbsp; 57 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; (i) The tax rate used was the one applicable to the financial Brazilian subsidiaries, which represent the most significant portion of the operations of the Group. The tax rate used is not materially different from the average effective tax rate considering all jurisdictions where the Group has operations. The effect of other tax rates is shown in the table above as &#8220;effect of different tax rates &#8211; subsidiaries and parent company&#8221;. b) Deferred income taxes The following tables present significant components of the Group&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the changes for the periods then ended.

MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND OTHER RISKS &nbsp; a) Overview &nbsp; The Group monitors the risks that could have a material impact on its strategic objectives, including those that must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To efficiently manage and mitigate these risks, the risk management structure conducts risk identification and assessment to prioritize the risks that are key to pursue potential opportunities and/or that may prevent value from being created or that may compromise existing value, with the possibility of having impacts on financial results, capital, liquidity, customer relationship and reputation. &nbsp; 62 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; Risks that are actively monitored include Credit, Liquidity, Market, Operational, IT, Cyber, Regulatory, Compliance, AML (Anti-money laundering) and Reputational Risk, Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRBB), Model Risk, and also the risk from Cryptocurrency business. Nu considers Risk Management an important pillar of the Group's strategic management. The risk management structure broadly permeates the entire Company, with the objective of ensuring that risks are properly identified, measured, mitigated, monitored and reported, in order to support the development of its activities. Risk Management is related to the principles, culture, structures and processes to improve the decision-making process and the achievement of strategic objectives. It is a continuous and evolving process that runs through Nu's entire strategy, to support Management in minimizing its losses, as well as maximizing its profits and supporting the Company's values. The Group's risk management structure considers the size and complexity of its business, which allows tracking, monitoring and control of the risks to which it is exposed. The risk management process is aligned with management guidelines, which, through committees and other internal meetings, define strategic objectives, including risk appetite. Conversely, the capital control and capital management units provide support through risk and capital monitoring and analysis processes. Each of the risks described below has its own methodologies, systems and processes for its identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation. In the case of financial risks, such as credit, liquidity, IRRBB and market risk, the measurement is carried out based on quantitative models and, in certain cases, prospective scenarios in relation to the main variables involved, respecting the applicable regulatory requirements and best market practices. Non-financial risks, such as operational risk and technological/cyber risks, are measured using impact criteria (inherent risk), considering potential financial losses, reputational damage, customer perception and legal/regulatory obligations, as well as evaluated in relation to the effectiveness of the respective structure of internal controls. There were no significant changes to the risk management structure that was reported in the most recent annual financial statements as of December 31, 2022. &nbsp; &nbsp; 63 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS &nbsp; a) Accounting for crypto-assets - Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&quot;SAB 121&quot;) In March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which addresses the rights and obligations of the parties to a crypto asset safeguarding arrangement. SAB 121 explains that an issuer that has obligations to safeguard digital assets held for their platform users should recognize those digital assets as an asset and a liability to return them to the customers, both of which are measured at fair value. &nbsp; &nbsp; 69 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six-month periods ended june 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; In June 2022, the Group launched a platform, through its subsidiary Nu Crypto Ltda. (&quot;Nu Crypto&quot;), which allows clients to trade crypto assets, in partnership with a specialized broker. The custody activity is performed by the broker, which holds the cryptographic key information, and the Company's contractual arrangements state that its customers retain legal ownership of the crypto; have the right to sell or transfer the crypto assets; and also benefit from the rewards and bear the risks associated with the ownership, including as a result of any crypto price fluctuations. The Company maintains an internal recordkeeping of the crypto assets held for the customers. The Group concluded that its activities may create crypto-asset safeguarding obligations (as defined in SAB 121) to its customers as a result of certain technological, legal and regulatory risks and, therefore, it should record a safeguarding liability and a corresponding asset at the fair value of the crypto assets held by customers on the Group&#8217;s platform. The following table summarizes the balances relating to crypto assets held for customers. For the purpose of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which were prepared specifically to meet CVM requirements, the asset and liability have not been recognized. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 Fair value of the crypto assets held for customers &nbsp; 33,568 &nbsp; 18,313 &nbsp; 70 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.
