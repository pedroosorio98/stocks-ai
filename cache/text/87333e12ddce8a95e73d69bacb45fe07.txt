A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance or financial position that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted Net Income is defined as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company for the period, adjusted for the expenses and allocated tax effects on share-based compensation. Adjusted Net Income is presented because management believes that this non-IFRS financial measure can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of the operating and financial performance of the Company, although it is not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. Nu also uses Adjusted Net Income as a key profitability measure to assess the performance of the business. Nu believes Adjusted Net Income is useful to evaluate operating and financial performance for the following reasons: Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Reconciliations Adjusted Net Income is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company&rsquo;s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period, depending on their accounting and tax methods, the book value and the market value of their assets and liabilities, and the method by which their assets were acquired; and Non-cash equity grants made to executives, employees or consultants at a certain price and point in time, and their hedge accounting effects for the corporate tax and social wages and their income tax effects, do not necessarily reflect how the business is performing at any particular time and the related expenses (and their subject impacts in the market value of assets and liabilities) are not key measures of core operating performance. Adjusted Net Income is not a substitute for Net Income, which is the IFRS measure of earnings. Additionally, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including competitors in the technology and financial services industries, because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner as we do, and therefore, measure may not be comparable to those of other companies.

FX Neutral measures are presented because management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of operating and financial performance, although they are not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. The FX Neutral measures were calculated to present what such measures in preceding periods would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these preceding periods until the date of the Company's most recent financial information. The FX Neutral measures for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts of Adjusted Net Income and the key business metrics for such period by the average Brazilian reais / U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (R$5.5463 to US$1.00) and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by average based on the USD/BRL spot last price rate for all business days within the reporting in the three months ended September 30, 2025 (R$5.4493 to US$1.00), so as to present what certain of statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained stable from this past period until the three months ended September 30, 2025. Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Reconciliations The average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated as the average based on the USD/BRL spot last price rate for all business days within the reporting in the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 as reported by Bloomberg. FX Neutral measures for deposits and interest-earning portfolio were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts as of each date, by the spot Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates as of each date and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by using the spot last price rate as September 30, 2025 (R$5.3217 to US$1.00) so as to present what these amounts would have been had exchange rates been the same on September 30, 2024. The Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated using rates as of such dates as reported by Bloomberg.
