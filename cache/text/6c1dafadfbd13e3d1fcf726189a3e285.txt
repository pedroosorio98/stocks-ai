Our credit portfolio grew significantly above market and maintained healthy quality levels. This result is driven by our advanced risk modeling, as well as our disciplined and resilient lending, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions . Despite recent short-term market volatility and our upcoming lock-up release, we remain fully confident and committed to our long-term value creation, as reiterated by our main shareholders&#8221;, said David V&eacute;lez, founder and CEO. &nbsp; Q1&#8217;22 Results Snapshot Below are Q1&#8217;22 performance highlights of Nu Holdings Ltd.: &nbsp; Operating Highlights: &#9679; Customer growth : Nu added 5.7 million customers in the quarter, reaching a total of 59.6 million customers in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.
