Nu&#8217;s stock exchange listings as well as our NuS&oacute;cios program also opened the door for millions of Brazilians to be included in the capital markets. Maintaining our long-term orientation and putting customers first, we are now accelerating efforts to build out Nu&#8217;s powerful ecosystem, enhance our digital banking platform and accelerate expansion into our new geographic markets to improve financial access for many others&#8221;, said David V&eacute;lez, founder and CEO. &nbsp; Q4&#8217;21 and FY&#8217;21 Results Snapshot Below are Q4&#8217;21 and full year 2021 performance highlights of Nu Holdings Ltd.: &nbsp; Operating Highlights: &#9679; Customer growth : Nu added 5.8 million customers in the quarter, reaching a total 53.9 million customers across Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. &#9679; Engagement and activity rates: Average Revenue per Active Customer (ARPAC) expanded to $5.6 in Q4'21 (from $3.3 in Q4&#8217;20) and the activity rate 1 to 76.3% (from 65.6% in Q4&#8217;20), with active customers reaching 41.1 million in the year-end. Nu estimates that over 55% of the monthly active customers that have been Nu customers for over a year have made Nu their primary banking account provider. &#9679; Low-cost operating platform : Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer decreased 20.4% on an FX neutral basis (FXN) 2 to $0.9 in Q4&acute;21 (and to $0.8 in 2021), while non-performing loan delinquency rates have remained below Nu&acute;s historical averages and industry averages. &nbsp; Financial Highlights: &#9679; Revenue: total revenue for Q4&acute;21 reached $635.9 million, increasing year-over-year (YoY) by 224.3% FXN. In 2021, total revenue was $1.7 billion, setting a new record for the Company. &#9679; Gross Profit: totaled $226.9 million in Q4&acute;21, increasing YoY 207% FXN, and increased to $732.9 million in 2021, up YoY 131.6% FXN. The gross margin was 35.7% in Q4&acute;21 compared to 37.7% in Q4&acute;20. &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; Adjusted Net income: Nu reported Adjusted Net Income of $3.2 million in Q4&acute;21. In 2021, the Company reported an Adjusted Net Income of $6.6 million compared to an Adjusted Net Loss of $26.8 million in 2020. This was the first year the Company posted positive Adjusted Net Income. &nbsp; Business highlights &#9679; Initial Public Offering (IPO) : Nu&#8217;s IPO was the world&#8217;s largest dual listing since 2012, raising approximately $2.8 billion in gross proceeds, after the partial exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares. It was the first-ever US IPO with a concurrent Brazilian Depository Receipt (BDR) offering in Brazil, through which the Company gifted a BDR to more than 7.5 million customers who joined the NuS&oacute;cios program and which helped multiply the number of Brazilians financially included in the investments markets. The IPO also represented one of the largest-ever global Directed Share Programs (DSP), where over 800,000 people participated in Nu's offering. Historically, Nu estimates it was also the largest number of retail investors to participate in a Brazilian IPO. &#9679; Products : During 2021, Nu launched numerous new products and features, including Marketplace (currently with over 20 partners), Apple/Google/Whatsapp Pay, UltraViolet (premium card), Secured Cards, Life Insurance and Proprietary Funds. Nu has NPS levels 90 or above in the countries in which it operates. &#9679; SMEs : The base of SME customers almost tripled in 2021, growing from 0.5 million to 1.4 million. &#9679; M&amp;A : During 2021, Nu closed the acquisition of Easynvest, the largest independent digital investment platform in Brazil, now NuInvest. The Company also closed the acquisitions of Juntos, a conversational platform, and SpinPay, a checkout solution provider, and announced the acquisition of Olivia, an AI-based personal finance management provider. &#9679; International expansion: Nu continues to see robust growth in Mexico, reaching 1.4 million customers at the end of 2021, expanding 1,243% YoY. It suggests Nu may have already become the largest issuer of new credit cards in the country in the same period. &nbsp; Footnotes 1 Activity rate is defined as monthly active customers divided by the total number of customers as of a specific date. 2 FX neutral measures were calculated to present what such measures in preceding periods/years would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these preceding periods/years until the date of the Company&#8217;s more recent financial information. &nbsp; CONFERENCE EARNINGS CALL DETAILS Nu will hold a Conference Earnings Call today at 5:00pm Eastern time/7:00pm Bras&iacute;lia time with simultaneous translation in Portuguese and English. &nbsp; To pre-register for this call, please click here A replay of the webcast will be made available after the call on the Investor Relations page: click here . &nbsp; Note on forward-looking statements and non-IFRS financial measures This release contains forward-looking statements.
