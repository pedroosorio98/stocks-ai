Net interest income was $483 million, up by $97 million, or 25%, due to higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by narrower deposit spreads. Revenue from Private Banking was $1.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $557 million, up 3%. Revenue from Retail was $534 million, down 2%. Assets under supervision were a record $2.0 trillio n, an increase of $105 billion, or 6%, from the prior year. Assets under management were a record $ 1.4 trillion, an increase of $52 billion, or 4%, from the prior year. Both increases were due to net inflows to long-term products and the impact of higher market levels. Custody, brokerage, administr ation and deposit balances were $631 billion, up by $53 billion, or 9%, due to deposit and custody inflows. The provision for credit losses was $19 million, compared with $5 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, an increase o f $69 million, or 4%, from the prior year, due to increased headcount-related 2 expense.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.4 billion, down by $172 million, or 3%, from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher noninterest expense, largely offset by higher net revenue. Net revenue was $27.4 billion, up by $1.6 billion, or 6%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $15.6 billion, up by $1.8 billion, or 1 3%, from the prior year.

News Release 12 The provision for credit losses was $726 million, d own $443 million, or 38%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $637 million, down $918 million from the prior year. The decrease in the consumer provision reflec ted improved delinquency trends across most consumer portfolios compared with the prior year, p artially offset by the effect of a lower net reduction in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior year. Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $2.4 billion, compared with $3.6 billion in th e prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 2.60% and 3.77%, respectively. The wholesale provis ion for credit losses was $89 million compared with a benefit of $386 million; prior year credit c osts reflected a reduction in loan loss reserves du e to an improvement in the credit environment. Wholes ale net charge-offs were $5 million, compared with $165 million in the prior year, resulting in n et charge-off rates of 0.01% and 0.30%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 3.11%, compared with 4.10% in the prior year. The Firm’s n onperforming assets totaled $11.7 billion at March 31, 2012, down from the prior-year level of $ 15.0 billion and up from the prior-quarter level of $11.0 billion. Noninterest expense was $18.3 billion, up 15% from the prior year, driven by higher compensation and noncompensation expense, including $2.5 billion of additional litigation reserves, predominantly for mortgage-related matters.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, whic h is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s defin ition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP re sults and includes certain reclassifications to pre sent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segm ents) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the manage d results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investme nts. This non-GAAP financial measure allows managem ent to assess the comparability of revenue arising from bo th taxable and tax-exempt sources. The correspondin g income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have n o impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-o f-period loans excludes the following: loans accoun ted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-imp aired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan los ses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totale d $5.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion at Ma rch 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and March 31, 2011, respectively. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represents common st ockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equit y less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable int angible assets (other than MSRs), net of related de ferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measu res the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of TCE. In management’s view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in as sessing the Firm’s use of equity, and in facilitating comparisons with competitors. d. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common di vided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is def ined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual pre ferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, i nvestors and analysts to assess and compare the qua lity and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm use s Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2 010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Bas el Capital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel I II.” The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Ba sel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflect s the Firm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and th e application of such rules to its businesses as cu rrently conducted, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes th e Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm’s estima tes of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolv e over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of fu rther rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimat e as a key measure to assess the Firm’s capital pos ition in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I r equirements, in order to enable management, investo rs and analysts to compare the Firm’s capital under the Basel III c apital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. The Firm’s understanding of the Basel III rules is based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agenci es. e. In Card Services & Auto, supplemental information i s provided for Card Services, to provide more meani ngful measures that enable comparability with prior perio ds. The net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benef its (excluding performance-based incentives), and o ther noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics inc lude certain TSS product revenue and liability bala nces reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of busines s. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and rev enue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as l iability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in management’s view, in order to understand the ag gregate TSS business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax e xpense divided by total net revenue, which is, in m anagement’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. e. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commit ments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses refle cts loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking, Card Services & Auto and Commerci al Banking. The amount of credit provided to not-fo r-profit and government entities, including states, municipa lities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Investment Bank.
