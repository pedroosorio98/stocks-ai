Regulation FD Disclosure. On June&nbsp;26, 2019, following months of discussion with Broadcom Inc. (&#147;Broadcom&#148;), the European Commission (&#147;Commission&#148;) announced that it has opened proceedings against Broadcom to investigate certain contracting practices in the sale of set-top box and broadband modem products. As a part of this ongoing investigation, the Commission has informed Broadcom of its objections to provisions in specific contracts with a limited number of customers that the Commission characterizes as exclusivity-inducing, and of the Commission&#146;s intention to adopt interim measures that would preclude Broadcom from enforcing these provisions pending the final outcome of the investigation. The interim measures, if adopted, will not preclude the continued sale by Broadcom of any products. Broadcom&#146;s contracts with these customers would remain in force, other than the provisions at issue, and it intends to continue to support these customers going forward. Accordingly, Broadcom believes that this action will not have a material impact on its set-top box or broadband modem businesses. Broadcom believes it complies with European competition rules and that the Commission&#146;s concerns are without merit. Broadcom will respond to the Commission regarding its objections and proposed interim measures. Broadcom will continue to cooperate with the Commission and looks forward to discussing procedural and substantive matters with the Commission over the coming weeks and months. This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, Broadcom&#146;s intentions and beliefs with regard to the Commission proceeding and its effects on Broadcom&#146;s business. These statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Broadcom&#146;s management, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual events or results may differ materially from those statements due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological, strategic or other regulatory factors, as well as factors affecting the operation of the Broadcom&#146;s business, many of which are outside Broadcom&#146;s and its management&#146;s control.
