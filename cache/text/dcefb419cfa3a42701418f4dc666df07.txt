Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively &#8220;Apple&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories and third-party digital content and applications.

Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period&#8217;s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company&#8217;s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(the &#8220; 2018 &#32;Form 10-K&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. A 14th week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company&#8217;s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company&#8217;s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) &#32;(&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;), and additional ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the &#8220;new revenue standard&#8221;), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.&#160;The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in the prior periods presented, as adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on previously reported amounts. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri &#174; &#32;and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales information for the first quarter of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. Financial Instruments In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities &#32;(&#8220;ASU 2016-01&#8221;), which updates certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 6 Income Taxes In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory &#32;(&#8220;ASU 2016-16&#8221;), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $2.7 billion &#32;of net deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by $128 million , and increased retained earnings by $2.6 billion &#32;on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;(net income in millions and shares in thousands): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Numerator: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net income $ 19,965 &#160; $ 20,065 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Denominator: &#160; &#160; &#160; Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,735,820 &#160; 5,112,877 Effect of dilutive securities 37,432 &#160; 44,910 Weighted-average diluted shares 4,773,252 &#160; 5,157,787 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Basic earnings per share $ 4.22 &#160; $ 3.92 Diluted earnings per share $ 4.18 &#160; $ 3.89 Potentially dilutive securities representing 28.8 million &#32;shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;because their effect would have been antidilutive. Note 2 &#8211; Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company&#8217;s products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company&#8217;s services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for products and services net sales is collected within a short period of time following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company&#8217;s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (&#8220;SSP&#8221;). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine the SSP. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company&#8217;s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company&#8217;s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 7 The Company has identified up to three &#32;performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company&#8217;s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products including, but not limited to, evaluating if it has the ability to establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in services net sales only the commission it retains. The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Deferred Revenue As of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had total deferred revenue of $8.4 billion &#32;and $8.8 billion , respectively. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company expects 66% &#32;of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% &#32;within one-to-two years, 6% &#32;within two-to-three years and 1% &#32;in greater than three years. Disaggregated Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;were as follows (in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 iPhone &#160;(1) $ 51,982 &#160; $ 61,104 Mac (1) 7,416 &#160; 6,824 iPad &#160;(1) 6,729 &#160; 5,755 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 7,308 &#160; 5,481 Services (3) 10,875 &#160; 9,129 Total net sales (4) $ 84,310 &#160; $ 88,293 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. (2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats&#174; products, HomePod, iPod touch&#174; and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. (3) Services net sales include sales from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare&#174;, Apple Pay, licensing and other services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of certain products. (4) Includes $2.4 billion &#32;and $2.0 billion &#32;of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 , respectively, that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each respective period. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 8 The Company&#8217;s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, &#8220;Segment Information and Geographic Data&#8221; for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 . Note 3 &#8211; Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The Company&#8217;s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument&#8217;s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (&#8220;OCI&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s investments in mutual funds represent its only marketable equity securities and are classified as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The Company&#8217;s marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net. The following tables show the Company&#8217;s cash and marketable securities by significant investment category as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(in millions): &#160; December 29, 2018 &#160; Adjusted Cost &#160; Unrealized Gains &#160; Unrealized Losses &#160; Fair Value &#160; Cash and Cash Equivalents &#160; Short-Term Marketable Securities &#160; Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 9,489 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 9,489 &#160; $ 9,489 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Level 1 (1) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Money market funds 6,424 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 6,424 &#160; 6,424 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Mutual funds 682 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 682 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 682 &#160; &#8212; Subtotal 7,106 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 7,106 &#160; 6,424 &#160; 682 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Level 2 (2) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Treasury securities 46,191 &#160; 6 &#160; (729 ) &#160; 45,468 &#160; 3,923 &#160; 6,415 &#160; 35,130 U.S. agency securities 9,731 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (31 ) &#160; 9,700 &#160; 7,552 &#160; 597 &#160; 1,551 Non-U.S. government securities 23,460 &#160; 48 &#160; (289 ) &#160; 23,219 &#160; 1,895 &#160; 4,129 &#160; 17,195 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 5,349 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 5,349 &#160; 3,705 &#160; 1,348 &#160; 296 Commercial paper 11,953 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 11,953 &#160; 11,679 &#160; 274 &#160; &#8212; Corporate debt securities 117,260 &#160; 32 &#160; (2,387 ) &#160; 114,905 &#160; 104 &#160; 27,134 &#160; 87,667 Municipal securities 953 &#160; 1 &#160; (7 ) &#160; 947 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 187 &#160; 760 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 17,320 &#160; 7 &#160; (428 ) &#160; 16,899 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 890 &#160; 16,009 Subtotal 232,217 &#160; 94 &#160; (3,871 ) &#160; 228,440 &#160; 28,858 &#160; 40,974 &#160; 158,608 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total (3) $ 248,812 &#160; $ 94 &#160; $ (3,871 ) &#160; $ 245,035 &#160; $ 44,771 &#160; $ 41,656 &#160; $ 158,608 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 9 &#160; September 29, 2018 &#160; Adjusted Cost &#160; Unrealized Gains &#160; Unrealized Losses &#160; Fair Value &#160; Cash and Cash Equivalents &#160; Short-Term Marketable Securities &#160; Long-Term Marketable Securities Cash $ 11,575 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 11,575 &#160; $ 11,575 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Level 1 (1) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Money market funds 8,083 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 8,083 &#160; 8,083 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; Mutual funds 799 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (116 ) &#160; 683 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 683 &#160; &#8212; Subtotal 8,882 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (116 ) &#160; 8,766 &#160; 8,083 &#160; 683 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Level 2 (2) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Treasury securities 47,296 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (1,202 ) &#160; 46,094 &#160; 1,613 &#160; 7,606 &#160; 36,875 U.S. agency securities 4,127 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (48 ) &#160; 4,079 &#160; 1,732 &#160; 360 &#160; 1,987 Non-U.S. government securities 21,601 &#160; 49 &#160; (250 ) &#160; 21,400 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,355 &#160; 18,045 Certificates of deposit and time deposits 3,074 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 3,074 &#160; 1,247 &#160; 1,330 &#160; 497 Commercial paper 2,573 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 2,573 &#160; 1,663 &#160; 910 &#160; &#8212; Corporate debt securities 123,001 &#160; 152 &#160; (2,038 ) &#160; 121,115 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 25,162 &#160; 95,953 Municipal securities 946 &#160; &#8212; &#160; (12 ) &#160; 934 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 178 &#160; 756 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 18,105 &#160; 8 &#160; (623 ) &#160; 17,490 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 804 &#160; 16,686 Subtotal 220,723 &#160; 209 &#160; (4,173 ) &#160; 216,759 &#160; 6,255 &#160; 39,705 &#160; 170,799 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total (3) $ 241,180 &#160; $ 209 &#160; $ (4,289 ) &#160; $ 237,100 &#160; $ 25,913 &#160; $ 40,388 &#160; $ 170,799 (1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity, credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The maturities of the Company&#8217;s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from one &#32;to five years . The following tables show information about the Company&#8217;s marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and for 12 months or greater as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(in millions): &#160; December 29, 2018 &#160; Continuous Unrealized Losses &#160; Less than 12 Months &#160; 12 Months or Greater &#160; Total Fair value of marketable debt securities $ 53,336 &#160; $ 127,006 &#160; $ 180,342 Unrealized losses $ (1,153 ) &#160; $ (2,718 ) &#160; $ (3,871 ) &#160; September 29, 2018 &#160; Continuous Unrealized Losses &#160; Less than 12 Months &#160; 12 Months or Greater &#160; Total Fair value of marketable &#160; securities $ 126,238 &#160; $ 60,599 &#160; $ 186,837 Unrealized losses $ (2,400 ) &#160; $ (1,889 ) &#160; $ (4,289 ) Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 10 The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company&#8217;s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company&#8217;s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security&#8217;s cost basis. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company does not consider any of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Non-Marketable Securities The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and has elected to apply the measurement alternative. As such, the Company&#8217;s non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in other income/(expense), net. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $2.2 billion . The Company holds a non-marketable debt security that is classified and accounted for as held-to-maturity. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s non-marketable debt security had an amortized cost basis and carrying value of $1.5 billion . Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates. To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries&#8217; functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months . To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its foreign currency&#8211;denominated debt, as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges. To protect the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s hedged term debt&#8211; and marketable securities&#8211;related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 24 years . The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. To protect the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 9 years . Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 11 Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Non-Designated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates. As a result, during the three months ended December 29, 2018 , the Company recognized a gain of $255 million &#32;in net sales, a gain of $175 million &#32;in cost of sales and a gain of $723 million &#32;in other income/(expense), net. The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company&#8217;s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(in millions): &#160; December 29, 2018 &#160; Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments &#160; Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments &#160; Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,110 &#160; $ 419 &#160; $ 1,529 Interest rate contracts $ 22 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 22 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivative liabilities (2) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 701 &#160; $ 345 &#160; $ 1,046 Interest rate contracts $ 821 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 821 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 12 &#160; September 29, 2018 &#160; Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Hedge Instruments &#160; Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Hedge Instruments &#160; Total Fair Value Derivative assets &#160;(1) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 1,015 &#160; $ 259 &#160; $ 1,274 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Derivative liabilities (2) : &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 543 &#160; $ 137 &#160; $ 680 Interest rate contracts $ 1,456 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 1,456 (1) The fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) The fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table shows the pre-tax gains and losses of the Company&#8217;s derivative and non-derivative instruments designated as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges in OCI and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;(in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Gains/(Losses) recognized in OCI &#8211; effective portion: &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash flow hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ (478 ) &#160; $ 153 Interest rate contracts &#8212; &#160; 1 Total $ (478 ) &#160; $ 154 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net investment hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign currency debt $ (16 ) &#160; $ 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income &#8211; effective portion: &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash flow hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ (118 ) &#160; $ (124 ) Interest rate contracts (1 ) &#160; 1 Total $ (119 ) &#160; $ (123 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments: &#160; &#160; &#160; Fair value hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 402 &#160; $ &#8212; Interest rate contracts 657 &#160; (274 ) Total $ 1,059 &#160; $ (274 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items: &#160; &#160; &#160; Fair value hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; Marketable securities $ (402 ) &#160; $ &#8212; Fixed-rate debt (657 ) &#160; 274 Total $ (1,059 ) &#160; $ 274 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 13 The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company&#8217;s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(in millions): &#160; December 29, 2018 &#160; September 29, 2018 &#160; Notional Amount &#160; Credit Risk Amount &#160; Notional Amount &#160; Credit Risk Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 56,000 &#160; $ 1,110 &#160; $ 65,368 &#160; $ 1,015 Interest rate contracts $ 33,250 &#160; $ 22 &#160; $ 33,250 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts $ 82,013 &#160; $ 419 &#160; $ 63,062 &#160; $ 259 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company&#8217;s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company&#8217;s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company&#8217;s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $56 million &#32;and $1.0 billion &#32;as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , respectively, which were recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts, the&#160;Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company&#8217;s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.9 billion &#32;and $2.1 billion , respectively, resulting in a net derivative liability of $260 million &#32;and a net derivative asset of $138 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had no &#32;customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As of September&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had one &#32;customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10% . The Company&#8217;s cellular network carriers accounted for 45% &#32;and 59% &#32;of total trade receivables as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had two &#32;vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 56% &#32;and 15% . As of September&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had two &#32;vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 62% &#32;and 12% . Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 14 Note 4 &#8211; Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; September&#160;29, 2018 Land and buildings $ 16,352 &#160; $ 16,216 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 66,823 &#160; 65,982 Leasehold improvements 8,351 &#160; 8,205 Gross property, plant and equipment 91,526 &#160; 90,403 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (51,929 ) &#160; (49,099 ) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 39,597 &#160; $ 41,304 Other Non-Current Liabilities &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; September&#160;29, 2018 Long-term taxes payable $ 30,948 &#160; $ 33,589 Other non-current liabilities 23,607 &#160; 15,325 Total other non-current liabilities $ 54,555 &#160; $ 48,914 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;(in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Interest and dividend income $ 1,307 &#160; $ 1,452 Interest expense (890 ) &#160; (734 ) Other income, net 143 &#160; 38 Total other income/(expense), net $ 560 &#160; $ 756 Note 5 &#8211; Income Taxes U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company&#8217;s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% &#32;to 21% &#32;effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act during the first quarter of 2019, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Uncertain Tax Positions As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $14.7 billion , of which $8.2 billion , if recognized, would impact the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate. The Company had accrued $1.2 billion &#32;of gross interest and penalties as of December&#160;29, 2018 . Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 15 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years subsequent to 2006 in certain major U.S. states and subsequent to 2010 in certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company&#8217;s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in the next 12&#160;months by as much as $300 million . European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two &#32;subsidiaries of the Company (the &#8220;State Aid Decision&#8221;). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be &#8364;13.1 billion , plus interest of &#8364;1.2 billion . Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer to Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; for more information. Note 6 &#8211; Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (&#8220;Commercial Paper&#8221;) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of both December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had $12.0 billion &#32;of Commercial Paper outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months . The weighted-average interest rate of the Company&#8217;s Commercial Paper was 2.39% &#32;as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and 2.18% &#32;as of September&#160;29, 2018 . The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the three months ended &#32; December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;(in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Maturities 90 days or less: &#160; &#160; &#160; Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ 2,011 &#160; $ 1,621 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Maturities greater than 90 days: &#160; &#160; &#160; Proceeds from commercial paper 2,166 &#160; 3,441 Repayments of commercial paper (4,171 ) &#160; (5,060 ) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net (2,005 ) &#160; (1,619 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total change in commercial paper, net $ 6 &#160; $ 2 Term Debt As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $103.8 billion &#32;(collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated and Australian dollar&#8211;denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated, Australian dollar&#8211;denominated, British pound&#8211;denominated, Japanese yen&#8211;denominated and Canadian dollar&#8211;denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc&#8211;denominated fixed-rate notes.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency&#8211;denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated notes. A portion of the Company&#8217;s Japanese yen&#8211;denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company&#8217;s net investment in a foreign operation. As of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $1.0 billion &#32;and $811 million , respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company&#8217;s use of derivative instruments, refer to the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments.&#8221; The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $809 million &#32;and $695 million &#32;of interest expense on its term debt for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 , respectively. As of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , the fair value of the Company&#8217;s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $102.6 billion &#32;and $103.2 billion , respectively. Note 7 &#8211; Shareholders&#8217; Equity Share Repurchase Program On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 billion &#32;of the Company&#8217;s common stock, of which $37.3 billion &#32;had been utilized as of December&#160;29, 2018 . During the three months ended &#32; December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company repurchased 38.0 million &#32;shares of its common stock for $8.2 billion . The Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 17 Note 8 &#8211; Comprehensive Income The Company&#8217;s OCI consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the pre-tax amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the associated financial statement line item, for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;(in millions): &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Three Months Ended Comprehensive Income Components &#160; Financial Statement Line Item &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Unrealized (gains)/losses on derivative instruments: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Foreign exchange contracts &#160; Total net sales &#160; $ 63 &#160; $ 184 &#160; &#160; Total cost of sales &#160; (375 ) &#160; (27 ) &#160; &#160; Other income/(expense), net &#160; 396 &#160; (33 ) Interest rate contracts &#160; Other income/(expense), net &#160; 1 &#160; (1 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 85 &#160; 123 Unrealized (gains)/losses on marketable securities &#160; Other income/(expense), net &#160; 47 &#160; (116 ) Total amounts reclassified from AOCI &#160; $ 132 &#160; $ 7 The following table shows the changes in AOCI by component for the three months ended &#32; December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;(in millions): &#160; Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation &#160; Unrealized Gains/Losses on Derivative Instruments &#160; Unrealized Gains/Losses on Marketable Securities &#160; Total Balances as of September 29, 2018 $ (1,055 ) &#160; $ 810 &#160; $ (3,209 ) &#160; $ (3,454 ) Other comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (82 ) &#160; (472 ) &#160; 140 &#160; (414 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI &#8212; &#160; 85 &#160; 47 &#160; 132 Tax effect 4 &#160; 95 &#160; (40 ) &#160; 59 Other comprehensive income/(loss) (78 ) &#160; (292 ) &#160; 147 &#160; (223 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (1) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 89 &#160; 89 Balances as of December 29, 2018 $ (1,133 ) &#160; $ 518 &#160; $ (2,973 ) &#160; $ (3,588 ) (1) Refer to Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for more information on the Company&#8217;s adoption of ASU 2016-01 at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. Note 9 &#8211; Benefit Plans Stock Plans The Company had 237.9 million &#32;shares reserved for future issuance under its stock plans as of December&#160;29, 2018 . Restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) granted under the Company&#8217;s stock plans generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock on a one -for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Company&#8217;s stock plans reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plans by two &#32;shares. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the plans utilizing a factor of two &#32;times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended December&#160;29, 2018 , Section 16 officers Angela Ahrendts, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri and Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company&#8217;s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the Company&#8217;s employee and director equity plans. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 18 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company&#8217;s RSU activity and related information for the three months ended &#32; December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;is as follows: &#160; Number of RSUs (in thousands) &#160; Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per RSU &#160; Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 29, 2018 92,155 &#160; $ 134.60 &#160; &#160; RSUs granted 29,228 &#160; $ 223.41 &#160; &#160; RSUs vested (18,935 ) &#160; $ 124.36 &#160; &#160; RSUs canceled (1,147 ) &#160; $ 154.53 &#160; &#160; Balance as of December 29, 2018 101,301 &#160; $ 161.91 &#160; $ 15,826 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $4.1 billion &#32;and $3.1 billion &#32;for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;(in millions):&#160; &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,559 &#160; $ 1,296 Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ (750 ) &#160; $ (631 ) As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $14.0 billion , which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years . Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies Accrued Warranty and Indemnification The following table shows changes in the Company&#8217;s accrued warranties and related costs for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;(in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,692 &#160; $ 3,834 Cost of warranty claims (996 ) &#160; (982 ) Accruals for product warranty 1,123 &#160; 1,471 Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 3,819 &#160; $ 4,323 Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed under the heading &#8220;Contingencies&#8221; below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 19 The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers manufactured in the U.S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Company&#8217;s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days . Other Off&#8211;Balance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any other off&#8211;balance sheet financing arrangements. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.9 billion . The Company&#8217;s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years &#32;and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off&#8211;balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (&#8220;unconditional purchase obligations&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s total future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year were $7.4 billion . Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 20 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as further discussed in Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the &#8220;Eastern Texas District Court&#8221;) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the &#8220;VirnetX Patents&#8221;) relating to network communications technology (&#8220;VirnetX I&#8221; and &#8220;VirnetX II&#8221;). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million , which later increased to $440 million &#32;in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the &#8220;Federal Circuit&#8221;). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded&#160;damages of $503 million . VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the &#8220;PTO&#8221;). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the&#160;Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company&#8217;s appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX&#8217;s appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. The remaining appeals from the PTO proceedings invalidating the VirnetX Patents remain pending. Qualcomm On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated and affiliated parties (&#8220;Qualcomm&#8221;) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. As the Company does not believe the demanded royalty it has historically paid contract manufacturers for each applicable device is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and believes it to be invalid and/or overstated in other respects as well, no Qualcomm-related royalty payments have been remitted by the Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the case and has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of this matter. Following the Company&#8217;s lawsuit, Qualcomm has filed patent infringement suits against the Company and its affiliates in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions, some of which seek to enjoin the sale of certain of the Company&#8217;s products in particular countries. In one matter pending in China, on November 30, 2018, a court issued an order enjoining the sale in China of certain iPhone models running iOS 10 or iOS 11. The Company has taken steps to comply with the order and has deployed a software update to address the functionality at issue. The Company has sought reconsideration and a declaration of compliance with the order and has appealed the decision. In another matter pending in Germany, on December 20, 2018, a court issued an order enjoining the sale in Germany by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries of iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X. The Company has taken steps to comply with the order and has appealed the decision. iOS Performance Management Cases Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to the Company&#8217;s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2. The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 2018, several U.S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers&#8217; user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 21 Note 11 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the &#8220;management&#8221; approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company&#8217;s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 &#32;Form 10-K. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company&#8217;s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;(in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Americas: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net sales $ 36,940 &#160; $ 35,193 Operating income $ 11,200 &#160; $ 11,316 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Europe: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net sales $ 20,363 &#160; $ 21,054 Operating income $ 6,658 &#160; $ 6,893 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Greater China: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net sales $ 13,169 &#160; $ 17,956 Operating income $ 5,314 &#160; $ 6,908 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Japan: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net sales $ 6,910 &#160; $ 7,237 Operating income $ 3,014 &#160; $ 3,082 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rest of Asia Pacific: &#160; &#160; &#160; Net sales $ 6,928 &#160; $ 6,853 Operating income $ 2,560 &#160; $ 2,575 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 22 A reconciliation of the Company&#8217;s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 &#32;is as follows (in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Segment operating income $ 28,746 &#160; $ 30,774 Research and development expense (3,902 ) &#160; (3,407 ) Other corporate expenses, net (1,498 ) &#160; (1,093 ) Total operating income $ 23,346 &#160; $ 26,274 Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 23 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (&#8220;Form 10-Q&#8221;) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as &#8220;future,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company&#8217;s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; which are incorporated herein by reference.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 24 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact product sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company&#8217;s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance. First &#32;Quarter Fiscal 2019 &#32;Highlights Total net sales decreased 5% or $4.0 billion during the first &#32;quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, driven by lower iPhone net sales, partially offset primarily by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during the first &#32;quarter of 2019. The Company began shipping iPhone X R &#32;in October 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company introduced two new versions of iPad Pro &#174; &#32;as well as a new Apple Pencil &#174; &#32;and Smart Keyboard Folio&#8482;, all of which began shipping in November 2018. The Company also introduced a new version of MacBook Air &#174; &#32;and a new Mac mini &#174; , both of which began shipping in November 2018. The Company repurchased $8.2 billion &#32;of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion &#32;during the first &#32;quarter of 2019 . Products and Services Performance Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales information for the first quarter of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. The following table shows net sales by category for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;(dollars in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 &#160; Change Net sales by category: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; iPhone &#160;(1) $ 51,982 &#160; $ 61,104 &#160; (15 )% Mac (1) 7,416 &#160; 6,824 &#160; 9 &#160;% iPad &#160;(1) 6,729 &#160; 5,755 &#160; 17 &#160;% Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 7,308 &#160; 5,481 &#160; 33 &#160;% Services (3) 10,875 &#160; 9,129 &#160; 19 &#160;% Total net sales $ 84,310 &#160; $ 88,293 &#160; (5 )% (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company&#8217;s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, &#8220;Segment Information and Geographic Data.&#8221; The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;(dollars in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 &#160; Change Net sales by reportable segment: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americas $ 36,940 &#160; $ 35,193 &#160; 5 &#160;% Europe 20,363 &#160; 21,054 &#160; (3 )% Greater China 13,169 &#160; 17,956 &#160; (27 )% Japan 6,910 &#160; 7,237 &#160; (5 )% Rest of Asia Pacific 6,928 &#160; 6,853 &#160; 1 &#160;% Total net sales $ 84,310 &#160; $ 88,293 &#160; (5 )% Americas Americas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2019. Europe Europe net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during the first quarter of 2019. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 26 Japan Japan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and iPad net sales. Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the first quarter of 2019 were generally flat compared to the same quarter in 2018, as higher Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales were offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the first quarter of 2019. Gross Margin Products and services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;were as follows (dollars in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Gross margin: &#160; &#160; &#160; Products $ 25,197 &#160; $ 28,589 Services 6,834 &#160; 5,323 Total gross margin $ 32,031 &#160; $ 33,912 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross margin percentage: &#160; &#160; &#160; Products 34.3 % &#160; 36.1 % Services 62.8 % &#160; 58.3 % Total gross margin percentage 38.0 % &#160; 38.4 % Products Gross Margin Products gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher net sales of Mac, iPad and Wearables. Year-over-year products gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to a different product mix and the impact of lower iPhone unit sales on the Company&#8217;s products fixed cost structure. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 due primarily to a different services mix. Year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to a favorable mix of services with higher margins and the impact of higher services net sales on the Company&#8217;s services fixed cost structure. The Company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the second &#32;quarter of 2019 &#32;to be between 37.0% and 38.0%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company&#8217;s expected total gross margin percentage in the second &#32;quarter of 2019 &#32;is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company&#8217;s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 27 Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;were as follows (dollars in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Research and development $ 3,902 &#160; $ 3,407 Percentage of total net sales 5 % &#160; 4 % Selling, general and administrative $ 4,783 &#160; $ 4,231 Percentage of total net sales 6 % &#160; 5 % Total operating expenses $ 8,685 &#160; $ 7,638 Percentage of total net sales 10 % &#160; 9 % Research and Development The growth in R&amp;D expense during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&amp;D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company&#8217;s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in professional fees and headcount-related expenses. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;was as follows (dollars in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 &#160; Change Interest and dividend income $ 1,307 &#160; $ 1,452 &#160; &#160; Interest expense (890 ) &#160; (734 ) &#160; &#160; Other income, net 143 &#160; 38 &#160; &#160; Total other income/(expense), net $ 560 &#160; $ 756 &#160; (26 )% The decrease in other income/(expense), net during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt, lower interest income and lower investment-related gains, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange&#8211;related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.19% and 2.11% in the first &#32;quarter of 2019 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 28 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018 &#32;and December&#160;30, 2017 &#32;were as follows (dollars in millions): &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Provision for income taxes $ 3,941 &#160; $ 6,965 Effective tax rate 16.5 % &#160; 25.8 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % &#160; 24.5 % The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 &#32;was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 &#32;was lower compared to the same quarter in 2018 &#32;due to higher taxes in 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) and a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities &#32;(&#8220;ASU 2017-12&#8221;). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments &#32;(&#8220;ASU 2016-13&#8221;), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) &#32;(&#8220;ASU 2016-02&#8221;), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9.1 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company&#8217;s lease portfolio as of the adoption date. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 29 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and for the first three &#32;months of 2019 &#32;and 2018 &#32;(in millions): &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; September&#160;29, 2018 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (1) $ 245,035 &#160; $ 237,100 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 39,597 &#160; $ 41,304 Commercial paper $ 11,969 &#160; $ 11,964 Total term debt $ 102,761 &#160; $ 102,519 Working capital $ 32,545 &#160; $ 15,410 &#160; Three Months Ended &#160; December&#160;29, 2018 &#160; December&#160;30, 2017 Cash generated by operating activities $ 26,690 &#160; $ 28,293 Cash generated by/(used in) investing activities $ 5,844 &#160; $ (13,590 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (13,676 ) &#160; $ (7,501 ) (1) As of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;and September&#160;29, 2018 , total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $19.9 billion &#32;and $20.3 billion , respectively, that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) and other agreements.

The Company&#8217;s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company&#8217;s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. During the three &#32;months ended December&#160;29, 2018 , cash generated by operating activities of $26.7 billion &#32;was a result of $20.0 billion &#32;of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $5.0 billion &#32;and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.8 billion . Cash generated by investing activities of $5.8 billion &#32;during the three &#32;months ended December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $9.8 billion , partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $3.4 billion .

Further information regarding the Company&#8217;s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; and Note 6, &#8220;Debt.&#8221; Capital Return Program On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 billion &#32;of the Company&#8217;s common stock, of which $37.3 billion &#32;had been utilized as of December&#160;29, 2018 . During the three months ended &#32; December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company repurchased 38.0 million &#32;shares of its common stock for $8.2 billion . The Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. On May 1, 2018, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2018. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Contractual Obligations Operating Leases As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company&#8217;s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $9.9 billion . The Company&#8217;s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years &#32;and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days . The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , the Company expects to pay $30.2 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&amp;D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.

Other Non-Current Liabilities As of December&#160;29, 2018 , a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company&#8217;s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the $30.9 billion &#32;deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. The Company&#8217;s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 31 Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions, which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties. The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2018 &#32;Form 10-K, and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2018 &#32;Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s condensed consolidated financial statements. With the exception of Revenue Recognition and Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities, there have been no material changes to the Company&#8217;s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2018 &#32;Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (&#8220;SSP&#8221;). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company&#8217;s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. The Company&#8217;s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management&#8217;s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company&#8217;s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 32 Impairment of Marketable Debt Securities The Company&#8217;s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company&#8217;s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company&#8217;s assessment of whether an available-for-sale debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company&#8217;s market risk during the first three &#32;months of 2019 . For a discussion of the Company&#8217;s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company&#8217;s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; of the 2018 &#32;Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#8217;s management, the Company&#8217;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)&#160;recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)&#160;accumulated and communicated to the Company&#8217;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting during the first &#32;quarter of 2019 , which were identified in connection with management&#8217;s evaluation required by paragraph (d)&#160;of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 33 PART II &#8212; OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Refer to the risk factor &#8220; The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights &#8221; &#32;in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; The Company settled certain matters during the first &#32;quarter of 2019 &#32;that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or operating results. Item 1A. Risk Factors The following description of risk factors includes any material changes to, and supersedes the description of, risk factors associated with the Company&#8217;s business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2018 &#32;Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company&#8217;s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Financial Statements&#8221; and Part I, Item 2, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Form 10-Q. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth . The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company&#8217;s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company&#8217;s products; and insolvency. A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 34 Global markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&amp;D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating&#160;the Company&#8217;s&#160;products and infringing on&#160;its&#160;intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company&#8217;s existing products. The Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 35 The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores. Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company&#8217;s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days . Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. Future operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on&#160;the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth &#8221; &#32;above, also could affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. If the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 36 The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. The Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted. The Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company&#8217;s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and services introductions and lost sales. The Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company&#8217;s content providers. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 37 The Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices may suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers. The Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the Company&#8217;s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights . The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 38 Except as described in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company&#8217;s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.&#160;These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company&#8217;s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. By way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier&#8217;s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier&#8217;s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.&#160;These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company&#8217;s products and services less attractive to the Company&#8217;s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. The Company&#8217;s business is subject to the risks of international operations. The Company derives a majority of its net sales and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s brand, international growth efforts and business. The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 39 The Company&#8217;s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company&#8217;s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company&#8217;s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company&#8217;s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. The Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company&#8217;s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company&#8217;s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation, financial condition and operating results. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (&#8220;PII&#8221;) with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation, financial condition and operating results. The Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company&#8217;s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 40 The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company&#8217;s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation, financial condition and operating results. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. Much of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. The Company&#8217;s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company&#8217;s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company&#8217;s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company&#8217;s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 41 Many of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company&#8217;s business and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate. The Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company&#8217;s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. The Company&#8217;s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company&#8217;s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the introduction of new products, including new products with higher cost structures. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products, issues with new product introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company&#8217;s stock price is subject to volatility. The Company&#8217;s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. The Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 42 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of December&#160;29, 2018 , a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Apple Inc. | Q1 2019 Form 10-Q | 43 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers Share repurchase activity during the three months ended December&#160;29, 2018 &#32;was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts): Periods &#160; Total Number of Shares Purchased &#160; Average Price Paid Per Share &#160; Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs &#160; Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) September 30, 2018 to November 3, 2018: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Open market and privately negotiated purchases &#160; 31,343 &#160; $ 219.71 &#160; 31,343 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; November 4, 2018 to December 1, 2018: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Open market and privately negotiated purchases &#160; 6,681 &#160; $ 202.07 &#160; 6,681 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; December 2, 2018 to December 29, 2018: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Open market and privately negotiated purchases &#160; &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; 38,024 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 62,734 (1) On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $100 billion &#32;of the Company&#8217;s common stock, of which $37.3 billion &#32;had been utilized as of December&#160;29, 2018 . The&#160;remaining $62.7 billion &#32;in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of December&#160;29, 2018 . The Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Item 3.
