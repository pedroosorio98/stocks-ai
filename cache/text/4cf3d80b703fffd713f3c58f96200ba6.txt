Cayman Islands &nbsp; Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position of Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as at March 31, 2023, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income or loss, changes in equity and cash flows for the three-month period then ended, and notes to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo; issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review. &nbsp; Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with Brazilian and International Standards on Review (NBC TR 2410 - Revis&atilde;o de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Intermedi&aacute;rias Executada pelo Auditor da Entidade and ISRE 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity , respectively). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2023, are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo;. &nbsp;

Nu Pagamentos is engaged in the issuance and administration of credit cards and payment transfers through a prepaid account, and participation in other companies as partner or shareholder.

Nu Financeira offers customers in Brazil the possibility to obtain loans that can be customized in relation to amounts, terms and conditions, number of installments, and transparent disclosure of any charges involved in the transaction, fully managed through the above-mentioned smartphone app. Loan issuance, repayment, and prepayments are available 24/7 through NuConta's account, directly in the app. Nu Financeira also grants credit to Nu Pagamentos credit card holders, due to overdue invoices, bill installments and revolving credit, and accepts on-demand and fixed term deposits from customers. &#9679; Nu Invest Corretora de Valores S.A.

(&quot;Nu DTVM&quot;) is an indirect subsidiary that executes securities brokerage activities in Brazil. &#9679; Nu M&eacute;xico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P. (&quot;Nu Financiera&quot;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Mexico. Nu Financiera is engaged in the issuance and administration of credit cards and payment transfers through a prepaid account. It commenced operations in the Mexican market in November 2022 and officially launched in December 2022. The credit card has similar characteristics to the Brazilian operation: an international credit card, with no annual fee, under the Mastercard banner, 100% managed by a digital app on a smartphone. &nbsp; 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; Nu Colombia S.A. (&#8220;Nu Colombia&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Colombia, with operations related to credit cards, which was launched in September 2020. On August 10, 2022, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (&quot;SFC&quot;) approved the Group's request to incorporate a financing company in Colombia, Nu Colombia Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Financiamiento S.A (&quot;Nu Colombia Financiamiento&quot;) (&quot;Incorporation License&quot;). Nu Colombia Financiamiento requested the license to operate as a financial company, which is still pending approval. If the request is approved, it will enable Nu Colombia to offer deposit products in the future, amongst other financial products. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as the &#8220;Group&#8221; or &quot;Nu&#8221;. &nbsp; The business plan of Nu provides for the continued growth of its Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian operations, not only related to existing businesses, such as credit cards, personal loans, investments, and insurance, but also complemented by the launch of new products. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption of the Group continuing as a going concern. &nbsp; The business is affected by customer behavior throughout the year and demonstrates seasonality effects. Historically, the Group benefited from a higher volume of transactions and related revenue in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. However, the growth has masked this seasonality in the past, and this may become more pronounced in the future. &nbsp; The Company&#8217;s Board authorized the issuance of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements on May 15, 2023. &nbsp; a) Level III BDR Program discontinuation &nbsp; On April 5, 2023 the Board of Directors decided to resubmit its plan for the voluntary discontinuance of its Level III BDRs Program, having approved the presentation of a new plan which would result in the cancellation of the Level III BDRs Program with the CVM; and, following this, the cancellation of the Company's registration with the CVM as a foreign public issuer of category &quot;A&quot; securities (&quot;New Plan&quot;). The New Plan is being submitted by the Company to B3 and CVM for further approval. If approved in the proposed format, the New Plan provides that the current holders of the BDRs must decide between: (i) remaining as the Company&#8217;s shareholder through the receipt of class A ordinary shares traded on the NYSE, with certain conditions that need to be met; (ii) remaining as holders of the Company's BDRs through the receipt of Unsponsored Level I BDRs; or (iii) if no declaration is made, the Company will sell the underlying shares on NYSE and former holders will receive the equivalent amount (&quot;Sales Facility&quot;). &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Over time, Nu aims to have other sponsoring companies (&#8220;Sponsors&#8221;) that commit to use Nucoin as their loyalty program. These Sponsors will be entitled to a certain number of Nucoins to distribute to their customers, and will be required to offer benefits to Nucoins&#8217; holders to incentivize the network adoption and increase the overall utility to the community. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE &nbsp; These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&quot;IFRS&#8221;) as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;IASB&#8221;). However, selected condensed explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to understanding the changes in the Company&#8217;s financial position and performance since the issuance of its last annual financial statements. &nbsp; The Group&#8217;s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting issued by IASB. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the &quot;Annual Financial Statements&#8221;). &nbsp; a) Functional currency and foreign currency translation &nbsp; The presentation of the functional currency and foreign currency translation disclosed in note 2a. of the Annual Financial Statements remain valid for these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The functional currency for Nu Holdings and the presentation currency of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements is the US Dollar (&#8220;US$&#8221;). The functional currency of the Brazilian operating entities is the Brazilian real, for the Mexican entities, Mexican peso and for the Colombian entity, the Colombian peso. &nbsp; The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries held in functional currencies that are not US$ are translated into US$, and the exchange differences arising from the translation to US$ of the financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than the US$ are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or loss (OCI) as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss within &#8220;currency translation on foreign entities&#8221;. &nbsp; b) New or revised accounting pronouncements adopted in 2023 &nbsp; The following new or revised standards have been issued by IASB, were effective for the period covered by these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and had no significant impact. &#9679; Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2); &#9679; Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8); &#9679; Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12); and c) Other new standards and interpretations not yet effective &#9679; Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1). Management does not expect the adoption of the amendments described above to have a significant impact, other than additional disclosures, on the consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION &nbsp; These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounting balances of Nu Holdings and all those subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, directly or indirectly. Control is achieved where the Company has (i) power over the investee; (ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) can use its power to affect its profits. The Company re-assesses whether it maintains control of an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three above mentioned elements of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over it and ceases when the Company loses control over it. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The financial information of the subsidiaries was prepared in the same period as the Company and consistent accounting policies were applied. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Company. Accordingly, all balances, transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising between consolidated entities are eliminated in the consolidation, except for foreign-currency gain and losses on translation of intercompany loans. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income or loss are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, when applicable.

(&quot;Nu Financiera&quot;), a Mexican subsidiary, is regulated by both the Mexican Central Bank (&quot;BANXICO&quot;) and Mexican National Banking and Stock Commission (&#8220;CNBV&#8221;) and Nu Colombia, a Colombian subsidiary, is regulated by Industry and Commerce Superintendency, and as such, there are some regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from these entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES &nbsp; The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements and therefore should be read in conjunction. &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS &nbsp; Use of estimates and judgments &nbsp; The preparation of financial statements requires judgments, estimates, and assumptions from management that affect the application of accounting policies, and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to the estimates are recognized prospectively. &nbsp; The significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 were the same as those adopted in the Annual Financial Statements. &nbsp; Credit losses on financial instruments &nbsp; The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on credit cards and loans receivables that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of allowance as of each reporting date. &nbsp; Management performs an analysis of the credit card and loan amounts to determine if credit losses have occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. &nbsp; Key areas of judgment &nbsp; The critical judgments made by management in applying the expected credit losses (ECL) allowance methodology are: a) Definition of default; b) Forward-looking information used for the projection of macroeconomic scenarios; c) Probability weights of future scenarios; d) Definition of significant increase in credit risk and lifetime; and e) Look-back period, used for parameters estimation (probability of default - PD, exposure at default - EAD and loss given default - LGD). Sensitivity analysis &nbsp; On March 31, 2023, the probability weighted ECL allowance totaled US$1,631,939 of which US$1,316,028 related to credit card operations and US$315,911 to loans. The ECL allowance is sensitive to the methodology, assumptions and estimations underlying its calculation. One key assumption is the probability weighting of the macroeconomic scenarios between upside, base and downside as the carrying amount of the credit loss allowance is determined based on the weighted average of these scenarios. The table below illustrates the ECL that would have arisen if management had applied a 100% weighting to each macroeconomic scenario. &nbsp; &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. &nbsp; All receivables are classified through stages, where: (i) stage 1 include all receivables not classified in stages 2 and 3; (ii) stage 2 is primarily related to all receivables more than 30 (thirty), but less than 90 (ninety), days in arrears, or with an increase in client's behavior risk score compared to the time of the origination; and (iii) stage 3 when receivables are more than 90 (ninety) days in arrears, or there are indications that the financial asset will not be fully paid without a collateral or financial guarantee. &nbsp; The majority of the Group's credit card portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 3 exposures increased to 6.9% on March 31, 2023 from 6.5% on December 31, 2022. The stage 3 movement is primarily due to credit expansions done in the past which are maturing in the portfolio, along with delinquency seasonality. &nbsp; 27 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

This movement is explained in the item c) Credit loss allowance - by stages and changes to models. There is still a significant concentration of receivables at stage 1 based on credit quality. Receivables with satisfactory risk are distributed between stages 1 and 2, mostly at stage 1. &nbsp; Defaulted assets at stage 3 are classified as higher risk. There is also a large proportion of stage 2 exposures classified as higher risk. Stage 1 receivables classified as higher risk are those customers with low credit risk scores. &nbsp; 29 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, which is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. &nbsp; The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored, to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. &nbsp; All receivables are classified through stages. The explanation of each stage is set out in the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, as disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022. &nbsp; The majority of the Group's loans to customers&#8217; portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 1 exposures increased to 78.5% on March 31, 2023, from 77.0% on December 31, 2022. The stage 1 movement is primarily due to the growth of the portfolio into lower risk segments. &nbsp; &nbsp; 33 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS &nbsp; The Group executes transactions with derivative financial instruments, which are intended to meet its own needs to reduce its exposure to market, currency and interest-rate risks. The derivatives are classified as at fair value through profit or loss, except those in cash flow hedge accounting strategies, for which the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives is recognized directly in other comprehensive income (loss). The management of these risks is conducted through determining limits, and the establishment of operating strategies. The derivative contracts are considered level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are used to hedge exposures, but hedge accounting is adopted only for forecasted transactions related to the cloud infrastructure and certain software licenses used by Nu (hedge of foreign currency risk), to hedge interest of the fixed rate credit portfolio (hedge of interest rate risk of portfolio) and to hedge the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting or SOP exercise, as shown below. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair values &nbsp; &nbsp; Notional amount &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; Liabilities Derivatives classified as fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 398,955 &nbsp; 93 &nbsp; 4 Exchange rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 143,572 &nbsp; 72 &nbsp; 885 Interest rate contracts - Swap &nbsp; 10,488 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1 Equity - Total Return Swap (TRS) &nbsp; 26,736 &nbsp; 700 &nbsp; 8,402 Currency - Non-deliverable forward contract (NDF) &nbsp; 166,600 &nbsp; 624 &nbsp; - Warrants (i) &nbsp; 100,000 &nbsp; 9,610 &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivatives held for hedging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Designated as cash flow hedge &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exchange rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 189,895 &nbsp; 18 &nbsp; 1,024 Equity - Total Return Swap (TRS) &nbsp; 62,990 &nbsp; 3,489 &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Designated as portfolio hedge &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DI - Future - notes 13 and 14 &nbsp; 1,147,279 &nbsp; 80 &nbsp; 28 Total &nbsp; 2,246,515 &nbsp; 14,686 &nbsp; 10,344 &nbsp; &nbsp; 40 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The total value of margins pledged by the Group in transactions on the stock exchange is presented in note 12. &nbsp; Swaps of interest risk contracts are settled on a daily basis and are traded over the counter with financial institutions as counterparties. &nbsp; Nu Holdings entered into non-deliverable forward contracts to hedge intercompany loans with Nu Colombia in US dollars with a settlement in December 2023. &nbsp; Swap TRS contracts are settled only at maturity and are traded over the counter with financial institutions as counterparties, see more details in item d. &nbsp; (i) Warrants &nbsp; In September 2021, Nu entered into an agreement with Creditas Financial Solutions Ltd. (and/or its affiliates in Latin America, or together, &#8220;Creditas&#8221;) through which Nu will distribute certain financial products offered by Creditas to its customers in Latin America. These include affordable retail collateralized loans, such as home and auto equity loans, auto financing, motorcycle financing and payroll loans. &nbsp; The agreement also provided that Nu would invest in Creditas&#8217; securitization vehicles, becoming the holder of the senior quotas of the fund. As of March 31, 2023 the Company had a total of US$184,224 invested in Creditas&#8217; securitization vehicles presented as FVTOCI. &nbsp; &nbsp; 41 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, Nu was granted warrants that provide the right to acquire an equity interest equivalent to up to 7.7% of Creditas, on a fully diluted basis, under a pre-agreed valuation, proportional to fifty percent of the amount invested in the securitization vehicles and products distributed. The notional of the warrants is US$100,000 and is presented in the table above. Nu can exercise the warrants at any time, but the expiration date is 2 years after the issuance date. &nbsp; As of March 31, 2023, the warrants' fair value was US$9,610 (US$27,908 as of December 31, 2022) calculated using a Black Scholes model, classified as level 3 on the fair value hierarchy, as shown in note 26. The Company recognized a fair value loss of US$18,298 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. The reduction in the warrant&#8217;s fair value resulted from updates in the assumptions used in the related option pricing model, including the reduction in the remaining exercise period of the warrants, which expire in September 2023. &nbsp; Breakdown by maturity &nbsp; The table below shows the breakdown by maturity of the notional amounts: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to 3 months &nbsp; 3 to 12 months &nbsp; Over 12 months &nbsp; Total Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 217,148 &nbsp; 104,929 &nbsp; 19,292 &nbsp; 341,369 Exchange rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 333,467 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 333,467 Interest rate contracts - Swap &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 10,488 &nbsp; 10,488 Currency - Non-deliverable forward contract (NDF) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 166,600 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 166,600 Warrants &nbsp; - &nbsp; 100,000 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 100,000 Total assets &nbsp; 550,615 &nbsp; 371,529 &nbsp; 29,780 &nbsp; 951,924 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity - Total Return Swap (TRS) &nbsp; 89,726 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 89,726 Interest rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 45,271 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 12,315 &nbsp; 57,586 DI - Future - notes 13 and 14 &nbsp; 579,390 &nbsp; 510,709 &nbsp; 57,180 &nbsp; 1,147,279 Total liabilities &nbsp; 714,387 &nbsp; 510,709 &nbsp; 69,495 &nbsp; 1,294,591 Total &nbsp; 1,265,002 &nbsp; 882,238 &nbsp; 99,275 &nbsp; 2,246,515 &nbsp; &nbsp; 42 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The Group managed its exposures to the variability in cash flows of foreign currency forecasted transactions to movements in foreign exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange contracts (exchange futures). These instruments are entered into to match the cash flow profile of the estimated forecast transactions, and are exchange-traded and fair value movements are settled on a daily basis. &nbsp; The Group applies hedge accounting to the forecasted transactions related to its main cloud infrastructure contract and other expenses in foreign currency. The effectiveness is assessed monthly by analyzing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the amount of the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. Derivatives are generally rolled over monthly. They are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedging instrument. Therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transaction have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective. Sources of ineffectiveness are differences in the amount and timing of forecast and actual payment of expenses. &nbsp; &nbsp; 44 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Thus, to protect the fixed rate risk from CDI variation, the Group entered into future DI contracts to offset the market risk, and applied hedge accounting aiming to eliminate differences between the accounting measurement of its derivatives and hedged items which are adjusted to reflect changes in CDI. The Group&#8217;s overall hedging strategy is to reduce fair value changes of the part of the fixed rate portfolio as if they were floating rate instruments linked to the attributable benchmark rates. As such, in order to reflect the dynamic nature of the hedged portfolio, the strategy is to rebalance the future DI contracts and evaluate the allocated amount by the credit portfolio. Additionally, ineffectiveness could arise from the disparity between expected and actual prepayments (prepayment risk). &nbsp; &nbsp; 45 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In accordance with its hedging strategy, the Group calculates the DV01 (delta value of a basis point ) of the exposure and futures to identify the optimal hedging ratio, and monitors in a timely manner the hedge relationship, providing any rebalancing if needed. The need for the purchase or sale of new future DI contracts will be assessed, to counterbalance the hedged item&#8217;s market value adjustment, aiming to assure hedge effectiveness between 80% and 125%, as determined on hedge documentation. &nbsp; The effectiveness test for the hedge is done in a prospective and retrospective way. In the prospective test, the Group compares the impact of a 1 basis point parallel shift on the interest rate curve (DV01) on the hedged object and on the hedge instrument market value. For the retrospective test, the market-to-market value change since the inception of the hedged object is compared to the hedge instrument. In both cases, the hedge is considered effective if the correlation is between 80% and 125%. &nbsp; For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in &quot;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments - financial assets at fair value&quot;. In addition, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of financial position. &nbsp; Effectiveness ratio - changes in fair value &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivative object hedge &nbsp; Fair value adjustment to the hedge object &nbsp; Derivative hedge instrument &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Asset &nbsp; Liability &nbsp; Fair value variation &nbsp; Effectiveness Interest rate risk &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest rate contracts - Future - portfolio hedge - credit card &nbsp; 36,351 &nbsp; (18) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 100.0% Interest rate contracts - Future - portfolio hedge - loan &nbsp; 701,042 &nbsp; (1,317) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 716 &nbsp; 99.0% Total &nbsp; 737,393 &nbsp; (1,335) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 722 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Hedge of corporate and social security taxes over share-based compensation &nbsp; The Group's hedge strategy is to cover the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting or SOP exercise from the variation of the Company's share price volatility. The derivative financial instruments used to cover the exposure are total return swaps (&quot;TRS&quot;) in which one leg is indexed to the Company's stock price and the other leg is indexed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&quot;SOFR&quot;) plus spread. The stock fixed at the TRS is a weighted average price. The hedge was entered into by Nu Holdings and therefore there is no income tax effect. &nbsp; &nbsp; 46 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Group applies the cash flow hedge for the hedge structure thus the market risk is replaced by an interest rate risk. The effectiveness assessment is performed monthly by (i) assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) monitoring the credit risk impact in the hedge effectiveness; and (iii) maintaining and updating the hedging ratio. Given the possibility of forfeiture impacting the future cash forecast of the employee benefit plan, the Group manages exposures to keep the hedging level within an acceptable coverage. The derivative fair value is measured substantially based on the stock price which is also used in the measurement of the provision or payment for corporate and social security taxes. There is no expectation for a mismatch between the hedged item and hedging instrument at maturity other than the SOFR. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three-month period ended &nbsp; Year ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; (4,876) &nbsp; - Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; 12,360 &nbsp; (8,871) Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period (i) &nbsp; (5,675) &nbsp; 3,995 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at end of the period &nbsp; 1,809 &nbsp; (4,876) (i) Presented as share-based compensation in general and administrative expenses.

Such matters are being discussed at the administrative and judicial levels, which, when applicable, are supported by judicial deposits. The provisions for probable losses arising from these matters are estimated and periodically adjusted by management, supported by external legal advisors&#8217; opinion. There is significant uncertainty relating to the timing of any cash outflow, if any, for civil and labor risk. &nbsp; &nbsp; 52 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Provision &nbsp; Regarding tax risks, a provision in the amount of US$16,423 as of March 31, 2023 (US$15,747 on December 31, 2022) mainly refers to a potential legal obligation related to the increase in the contribution of certain Brazilian taxes (PIS and COFINS). The Group has a judicial deposit in the amount related to this claim, as shown below in item c). In June 2019, Nu withdrew the lawsuit and is currently awaiting the release of the judicial deposits to the Brazilian Tax Authorities. &nbsp; Civil lawsuits are mainly related to credit card operations. Based on management&#8217;s assessment and inputs from Nu&#8217;s external legal advisors, the Group has provisioned US$3,422 (US$2,096 on December 31, 2022) considered sufficient to cover estimated losses from civil suits deemed probable. &nbsp; b) Changes &nbsp; Changes to provision for lawsuits and administrative proceedings are as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Tax &nbsp; Civil &nbsp; Labor &nbsp; Tax &nbsp; Civil &nbsp; Labor &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; 15,747 &nbsp; 2,096 &nbsp; 104 &nbsp; 17,081 &nbsp; 980 &nbsp; 21 Additions &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,486 &nbsp; 61 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,942 &nbsp; 100 Payments / Reversals &nbsp; - &nbsp; (281) &nbsp; (27) &nbsp; (2,341) &nbsp; (857) &nbsp; (18) Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; 676 &nbsp; 121 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; 1,007 &nbsp; 31 &nbsp; 1 Balance at end of the period &nbsp; 16,423 &nbsp; 3,422 &nbsp; 143 &nbsp; 15,747 &nbsp; 2,096 &nbsp; 104 &nbsp; c) Contingencies &nbsp; The Group is a party to civil and labor lawsuits, involving risks classified by management and the legal advisors as possible losses, totaling approximately US$11,424 and US$2,859, respectively (US$7,128 and US$1,814 on December 31, 2022). Based on management&#8217;s assessment and inputs from the Group&#8217;s external legal advisors, no provision was recognized for those lawsuits as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. &nbsp; As of March 31, 2023, the total amount of judicial deposits shown as &#8220;Other assets&#8221; (note 17) is US$19,780 (US$18,864 on December 31, 2022) and is substantially related to the tax proceedings. &nbsp; &nbsp; 24.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deferred revenue from rewards programs is related to the Group's reward program for its credit card customers, called &quot;Rewards&quot;. The program consists of accumulating points according to the use of the credit card in the ratio of R$1.00 (one Brazilian real, equivalent to US$0.20 as of March 31, 2023 (US$0.19 as of December 31, 2022)) equal to 1 point and cashbacks. The points do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of Rewards an eligible card member can earn. Deferred annual fees from reward program comprise amounts related to the rewards fees which are paid annually by customers until they are earned. &nbsp; The redemption of the points occurs when the customers use them in various expense categories, such as air tickets, hotels, transportation services, and music. &nbsp; Nu uses financial models to estimate the redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members, and, therefore, the estimated financial value of the points, based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, among others. The estimated financial value is recorded in the profit or loss when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is when the reward points are redeemed. &nbsp; &nbsp; 25. RELATED PARTIES &nbsp; In the ordinary course of business, the Group may have issued credit cards or loans to Nu&#8217;s executive directors, board members, key employees and close family members. Those transactions, as well as the deposits and other products, as investments, occur on similar terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. &nbsp; As described in note 3, &quot;Basis of consolidation&quot;, all companies from the Group are consolidated in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, related party balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; In 2023, the exchange differences arising from intercompany loans between entities of the group with different functional currencies are shown as &#8220;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments&#8221; in the statement of profit (loss). &nbsp; a) Transactions with other related parties &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets/ (Liabilities) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Others &nbsp; - &nbsp; 316 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenues (expenses) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Others &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1,112) &nbsp; &nbsp; 54 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

On June 30, 2021, the Group entered into a service and naming rights agreement with Rodamoinho Produtora de Eventos Ltda., owned by a former member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (&quot;Board&quot;). This director has not been a member of the Board since September, 2022, when the Company ceased recognizing Rodamoinho as a related party. In addition, the Group did not make payments for Reprograma, a philanthropic project managed by a family member of the Company&#8217;s controlling shareholder, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. &nbsp; &nbsp; 26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT &nbsp; The main valuation techniques employed in internal models to measure the fair value of the financial instruments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are set out below. The principal inputs into these models are derived from observable market data. The Group did not make any material changes to its valuation techniques and internal models in those periods. &nbsp; a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost &nbsp; The following tables show the fair value of the financial instruments carried at amortized cost as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments such as compulsory and other deposits at central banks, other financial assets at amortized cost, deposits in electronic money, RDB and borrowings and financing, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Carrying amount &nbsp; Fair value - Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value - Level 3 &nbsp; Carrying amount &nbsp; Fair value - Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value - Level 3 Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &nbsp; 2,671,668 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,778,019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card receivables (i) &nbsp; 9,158,470 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 9,109,455 &nbsp; 8,233,123 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 8,204,077 Loans to customers (i) &nbsp; 2,021,508 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 2,238,328 &nbsp; 1,676,276 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,920,518 Other receivables &nbsp; 1,076,681 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,078,339 &nbsp; 521,670 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 522,359 Other financial assets &nbsp; 102,592 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 478,283 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp; 15,030,919 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 12,426,122 &nbsp; 13,687,371 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 10,646,954 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deposits in electronic money &nbsp; 1,236,940 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,534,582 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bank receipt of deposits (RDB) &nbsp; 14,520,723 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,273,959 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Payables to network &nbsp; 6,871,826 &nbsp; 6,472,107 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 7,054,783 &nbsp; 6,399,704 &nbsp; - Borrowings and financing &nbsp; 651,181 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 585,568 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp; 23,280,670 &nbsp; 6,472,107 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 23,448,892 &nbsp; 6,399,704 &nbsp; - (i) It excludes the fair value adjustment from the hedge accounting. &nbsp; &nbsp; 55 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book value from credit card receivables and loans to customers includes the amounts that are the hedge items of the portfolio hedge, described in note 18. The credit risk components for both receivables are not part of the hedge strategy. &nbsp; Borrowings and financing fair value is equal to the book value given that any prepayment shall be equal to the total outstanding amount. The fair value of floating rate demand deposits are assumed to be equal to carrying amounts. &nbsp; The valuation approach to specific categories of financial instruments is described below. &nbsp; i) Fair value models and inputs &nbsp; Credit card: The fair values of credit card receivables and payables to network are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Fair values are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. For payables, cash flows are also discounted by the Group's own credit spread. For past due receivables, the Group used the recovery rate of late payments as an input that is not directly observable and was estimated using the Group's internal databases. Loans to customers: Fair value is estimated based on groups of clients with similar risk profiles, using valuation models. The fair value of a loan is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the risk-free interest rate curve and a credit spread. For past due receivables, the Group used the recovery rate of late payments as an input that is not directly observable and was estimated using the Group's internal databases. Other receivables: Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows by a risk free interest rate and a credit spread. &nbsp; b) Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value &nbsp; The following table shows a summary of the fair values, as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of the financial assets and liabilities indicated below, classified on the basis of the various measurement methods used by the Group to determine their fair value: &nbsp; &nbsp; 56 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Therefore, all the government bonds and some corporate bonds are included in level 1 as they are traded in active markets. Brazilian securities values are the published prices by the 'Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais' (&#8220;Anbima&#8221;). For US, Mexico and Colombia bonds, fair values are the published prices by Bloomberg. Other corporate bonds and investment fund shares, whose valuation is based on observable data, such as interest rates and interest rate curves are classified as level 2. Derivatives : Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified as level 1 of the hierarchy. Derivatives traded on the Brazilian stock exchange are fairly valued using B3 quotations. Interest rate OTC Swaps are valued by discounting future expected cash flows to present values using interest rate curves and are classified as level 2. The embedded derivative conversion feature from the senior preferred share was calculated based on methodologies for the share price described in note 10. The options related to the warrant from Creditas Partnership are fair valued using a Black-Scholes model and are classified as level 3. &nbsp; 58 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity instrument: For the fair value of the equity instrument, the Group used contractual conditions as inputs that are not directly observable, and therefore it is classified as level 3. Instruments eligible as capital: If the instrument has an active market, prices quoted in this market are used. Otherwise, valuation techniques are used, such as discounted cash flows, where cash flows are discounted by a risk-free rate and a credit spread. Instruments eligible as capital were designated at fair value through profit (loss) in the initial recognition (fair value option). The fair value is the transaction value itself given that it is a short-term one day agreement. Repurchase agreements: The fair value is the transaction value itself given that repurchase agreement is a collateralized short-term one day agreement. &nbsp; c) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy &nbsp; For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels 1 and 2 or between levels 2 and 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; 27. INCOME TAX &nbsp; Current and deferred taxes are determined for all transactions that have been recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the current tax laws. The current income tax expense or benefit represents the estimated taxes to be paid or refunded, respectively, for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary tax differences are expected to reverse. &nbsp; a) Income tax reconciliation &nbsp; The tax on the Group's pre-tax profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities. Thus, the following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to profit (loss) for the period, calculated by applying the combined Brazilian income tax rate o f 40% for the three-month periods ended March 31 , 2023 and 2022: &nbsp; &nbsp; 59 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The tax rate used is not materially different from the average effective tax rate considering all jurisdictions where the Group has operations. The effect of other tax rates is shown in the table above as &#8220;effect of different tax rates &#8211; subsidiaries and parent company&#8221;. &nbsp; b) Deferred income taxes &nbsp; The following tables present significant components of the Group&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the changes for the periods then ended. The accounting records of deferred tax assets on income tax losses and/or social contribution loss carryforwards, as well as those arising from timing differences, are based on technical feasibility studies which consider the expected generation of future taxable income, considering the history of profitability for each subsidiary individually. The Group has no time limit for use of the deferred tax assets, but the use of the deferred tax asset related to tax loss and negative basis of social contribution is limited to 30% of taxable profit per year for the Brazilian entities. &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND OTHER RISKS &nbsp; a) Overview &nbsp; The Group monitors the risks that could have a material impact on its strategic objectives, including those that must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To efficiently manage and mitigate these risks, the risk management structure conducts risk identification and assessment to prioritize the risks that are key to pursue potential opportunities and/or that may prevent value from being created or that may compromise existing value, with the possibility of having impacts on financial results, capital, liquidity, customer relationship and reputation. &nbsp; Risks that are actively monitored include: &nbsp; 1. Credit risk; 2. Liquidity risk; 3. Market Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB); 4. Operational Risk / Information Technology/Cyber Risk; 5. Regulatory Risk; 6. Compliance Risk; 7. Reputational Risk; and 8. Risks from cryptocurrency business. &nbsp; b) Risk management structure &nbsp; Nu considers Risk Management an important pillar of the Group's strategic management. The risk management structure broadly permeates the entire Company, with the objective of ensuring that risks are properly identified, measured, mitigated, monitored and reported, in order to support the development of its activities. Risk Management is related to the principles, culture, structures and processes to improve the decision-making process and the achievement of strategic objectives. It is a continuous and evolving process that runs through Nu's entire strategy, to support Management in minimizing its losses, as well as maximizing its profits and supporting the Company's values. &nbsp; The Group's risk management structure considers the size and complexity of its business, which allows tracking, monitoring and control of the risks to which it is exposed. The risk management process is aligned with management guidelines, which, through committees and other internal meetings, define strategic objectives, including risk appetite. Conversely, the capital control and capital management units provide support through risk and capital monitoring and analysis processes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Group considers a risk appetite statement (&#8220;RAS&#8221;) to be an essential instrument to support risk management and decision making. The Board reviews and approves the RAS, as guidelines and limits for the business plan and capital deployment. Nu has defined a RAS (aligned to local regulatory requirements) that prioritizes the main risks and, for each of these, qualitative statements and quantitative metrics expressed in relation to earnings, capital, risk measures, liquidity and other relevant measures were implemented, as appropriate. &nbsp; Nu operates on the three-line model, which helps to identify structures and processes that best support the achievement of objectives and facilitate a robust governance and risk management structure. &nbsp; &#9679; First line : business functions and support functions/areas or activities that generate exposure to risk, whose managers are responsible for managing them in accordance with policies, limits and other conditions defined and approved by the Executive Board. The first line must have the means to identify, measure, treat and report risks. &#9679; Second line : consisting of the areas of Risk Management, Internal Controls and Compliance, it is responsible for ensuring an effective control of risks and that they are managed in accordance with the defined appetite level. Responsible for proposing risk management policies, developing risk models and methodologies, and first-line supervision. &#9679; Third line : composed of the Internal Audit, it is responsible for periodically and independently evaluating whether policies, methods and procedures are adequate, in addition to verifying their effective implementation. &nbsp; Another important element of the risk management framework is the structure of Technical Forums and Committees. These governance bodies were designed and implemented to monitor and make decisions on aspects associated with the Group's management and control. Nu has implemented this structure both at a Global and a country-level perspective, as described below. &nbsp; Global risk-related Governance body: &nbsp; &#9679; Audit and Risk Committee : established as a Board of Director level committee in order to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities to the Company&#8217;s shareholders with respect to: evaluating the performance and progress of the work of the Internal Audit, the independent audit, as well as the respective reports related to the internal control systems, following the recommendations made by the internal and independent auditors to management, reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements, overseeing the performance of overall Nu's risk management framework and control functions, and monitoring the level of risk exposure according to the RAS (consolidated view by country). It consists of at least three members and meets at least quarterly. &nbsp; &nbsp; 66 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Country-level risk-related Governance bodies: &nbsp; Each of the countries where the Group has operations established a structure of governance based on the relevant regulatory requirements and composed of the following elements. Depending on the nature of the subject to be managed, some Committees and meetings can be grouped to cover more than one country. &nbsp; &#9679; Risk Committee : its objective is to assist the country's executive officers in the performance of the entity&#8217;s risk management and control functions, monitoring the level of risk exposure according to risk appetite. It also aims to adopt strategies, policies and measures directed at disseminating a culture of internal controls and risk mitigation. &#9679; Credit Committee : its objective is to review and supervise credit strategies, as well as review the impacts on the subsidiary's results, and to review the credit strategies in light of the macroeconomic environment and risk information, on the credit market and on competitors. &#9679; Audit Committee : its main duties are to evaluate the performance and progress of the work of the Internal Audit function, the independent auditors, and the respective reports related to the internal control systems, to follow the recommendations made by internal and independent auditors to management, and to review and discuss with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements. &#9679; Technical Forums : regular meetings to discuss and propose recommendations to the country-level Risk Committee. Depending on the materiality in each of the countries, each topic listed below can have its own Technical Forum, with the participation of executives from associated areas such as: accounting and tax, operational risk and internal controls, asset and liability management (&quot;ALM&quot;) / capital, information technology and cyber risks (&quot;IT&quot;), data protection, Compliance and anti-money laundering (&quot;AML&quot;), fraud prevention, stress tests, product review and credit provisions. Each Technical Forum has its own charter, establishing the scope of work, voting members and other working model attributes. &nbsp; c) Risks actively monitored &nbsp; The risks that are actively monitored by the Group include Credit Risk, Market Risk, Interest rate risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB), Liquidity Risk, Operational Risk, Internal Controls, Information Technology and Cyber Risk, Model Risk, Compliance and Anti-money laundering (AML). The management of these risks is carried out according to the three-line model, considering policies and procedures in place, as well as the limits established in the RAS. Also, there is a Stress Testing program in place. &nbsp; Each of the risks described below has its own methodologies, systems and processes for its identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation. &nbsp; &nbsp; 67 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of financial risks, such as credit, liquidity, IRRBB and market risk, the measurement is carried out based on quantitative models and, in certain cases, prospective scenarios in relation to the main variables involved, respecting the applicable regulatory requirements and best market practices. Non-financial risks, such as operational risk and technological/cyber risks, are measured using impact criteria (inherent risk), considering potential financial losses, reputational damage, customer perception and legal/regulatory obligations, as well as evaluated in relation to the effectiveness of the respective structure of internal controls. &nbsp; Based on the results of the measurement and risk assessment activities, the adherence of the residual exposure to Nu's risk appetite is verified. Necessary actions to mitigate risks are presented and discussed in the governance structure (Technical Forums and Risk Committees), which are also the channels responsible for approving and monitoring the implementation of action plans. &nbsp; &#9679; Credit risk &nbsp; Credit risk is defined as the possibility of losses associated with failure of customers or counterparties to pay their contractual obligations; the depreciation or reduction of the expected gains from financial instruments due to the deterioration of the credit quality of customers or counterparties; the costs of recovering the deteriorated exposure; and any advantage given to customers or counterparties due to deterioration in their credit quality. &nbsp; The credit risk control and management structure is independent of the business units, being responsible for the processes and tools to measure, monitor, control and report the credit risk of products and other financial operations, continuously verifying their adherence to the policies and structure of approved limits. There is also an assessment of the possible impacts arising from changes in the economic environment, in order to ensure that the loan portfolio is resilient to economic crises. &nbsp; Credit risk management is carried out by the Credit Risk team with a centralized role independent of the business units, being responsible for: &nbsp; &#9679; Establishing governance, policies and procedures aimed at maintaining exposure to credit risks in accordance with the levels set in the RAS; &#9679; Monitoring and notifying management of the risk levels (appetite compliance) of the credit portfolio, including recommendations for improvement, when applicable; &#9679; Identifying and assessing inherent risks and respective mitigators in the launch of new products and significant changes in existing processes; and &#9679; Estimating the expected losses according to consistent and verifiable criteria. &nbsp; &nbsp; 68 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Group&#8217;s outstanding balance of financial assets is shown in the table below: &nbsp; Financial assets &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp; 4,310,496 &nbsp; 4,172,316 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 94,038 &nbsp; 91,853 Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 14,686 &nbsp; 41,485 Collateral for credit card operations &nbsp; 309 &nbsp; 305 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; 109,033 &nbsp; 133,643 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 7,916,143 &nbsp; 9,947,138 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income &nbsp; 7,916,143 &nbsp; 9,947,138 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &nbsp; 2,671,668 &nbsp; 2,778,019 Credit card receivables &nbsp; 9,158,452 &nbsp; 8,233,072 Loans to customers &nbsp; 2,020,191 &nbsp; 1,673,440 Other receivables &nbsp; 1,076,681 &nbsp; 521,670 Other financial assets &nbsp; 102,592 &nbsp; 478,283 Financial assets at amortized cost &nbsp; 15,029,584 &nbsp; 13,684,484 Total &nbsp; 27,365,256 &nbsp; 27,937,581 &#9679; Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as: &#9679; the ability of an entity to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses; and &#9679; the possibility of not being able to easily exit a financial position due to its size compared to the traded volume in the market. The liquidity risk management structure uses future cash flow data, applying what Nu believes to be a severe stress scenario to these cash flows, in order to measure that the volume of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that the Group has is sufficient to guarantee its resilience even in very adverse situations. Assets are considered to be HQLA if they can be easily and immediately converted into cash at little or no loss of value. In this definition we consider Brazilian government bonds that are not blocked as margin requirements, unencumbered deposits at Brazilian Central Bank and Reverse Repo. The liquidity indicators are monitored daily. The Group has a Contingency Funding Plan for the Brazilian entities that describes possible management actions that should be taken in the event of a deterioration of the liquidity indicators. &nbsp; 69 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

IRRBB refers to the current or prospective risk to an entity's capital and earnings arising from adverse movements in interest rates that affect the banking book positions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 70 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a market risk &amp; IRRBB control and management structure, independent from the business units, which is responsible for the processes and tools to measure, monitor, control and report the market risk and IRRBB, continuously verifying the adherence with the approved policies and limit&#8217;s structure. &nbsp; Management of market risk and IRRBB is based on metrics that are reported to the Asset &amp; Liability Management and Capital (&quot;ALM&quot;) Technical Forum and to the country-level Risk Committee. Management is authorized to use financial instruments as outlined in the Group's internal policies to hedge market risk &amp; IRRBB exposures. &nbsp; Management of market risk and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is based on the following metrics: &nbsp; &#9679; Interest Rate Sensitivity (DV01): impact on the market value of cash flows, when submitted to a one basis point increase in the current annual interest rates or index rate; &#9679; Value at Risk (VaR): maximum market value loss for a holding period with a confidence level; and &#9679; FX exposures: considering all financial positions that bring FX risk and operational expenses in other currencies. The table below presents the VaR which uses a confidence level of 99% and a holding period of 10 days, by a historical simulation approach, with a 5-year historical window. For Brazil, it is calculated only for the Trading Book in line with the way portfolios are managed. For Nu Holdings, it is considering only financial assets held directly by Nu Holdings, and it is not considering assets in other countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Positions in Colombia and Mexico are not significant as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. &nbsp; VaR &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Financeira (1) / Nu Pagamentos (Brazil) &nbsp; 435 &nbsp; 478 Nu Holdings &nbsp; 19,377 &nbsp; 10,321 (1) Includes Nu Financeira and its subsidiaries Nu Invest and Nu DTVM. &#9679; Interest rate risk The following analysis is the Group's sensitivity of the mark to market fair value to an increase of 1 basis point (&#8220;bp&#8221;) (DV01) in the Brazilian risk-free curve, Brazilian IPCA coupon curve, US risk-free curve and Mexican risk-free curve, assuming a parallel shift and a constant financial position: &nbsp; DV01 &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazilian risk-free curve &nbsp; (104) &nbsp; (41) Brazilian IPCA coupon &nbsp; (3) &nbsp; (5) US risk-free curve &nbsp; (125) &nbsp; (121) Mexican risk-free curve &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 71 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The interest rate risk in Colombia and in Brazilian subsidiaries other than Nu Pagamentos and Nu Financeira is not significant as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. To maintain DV01 sensitivities within defined limits, interest rate futures, traded in B3, and swaps derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk. &nbsp; Foreign exchange (FX) risk &nbsp; The financial information may exhibit volatility due to the Group&#8217;s operations in foreign currencies, such as the Brazilian Real and Mexican and Colombian Pesos. At the Nu Holdings level, there is no net investment hedge for investments in other countries. &nbsp; As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, none of the entities of the Group had significant financial instruments in a currency other than their respective functional currencies. &nbsp; The functional currency of the entities in Brazil is the Brazilian Real. Certain costs in US Dollars and Euros, or intercompany loans in US Dollars, are hedged with futures contracts, traded on the B3 exchange, based on projections of these costs, or when there are new exposures. Hedge transactions are adjusted when internal cost projections change and when the FX derivatives expire. As a result, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have no significant exposures to exchange rates after the hedge transactions take effect. &nbsp; &#9679; Operational risk &nbsp; Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or from failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. In this context, the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by Nu, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensations for damages to third parties arising from the activities developed by the Company must also be considered. &nbsp; The structure of control and management of operational risk and internal controls is independent of the business and support units, being responsible for the identification and assessment of operational risks, as well as for evaluating the design and effectiveness of the internal controls, covering risks such as system and services disruption, external fraud and failures in activities involved in payment scheme arrangements. This structure is also responsible for the preparation and periodic testing of the business continuity plan and for coordinating the risk assessment in new product launches and significant changes to existing processes. &nbsp; Within the governance of the risk management process, mechanisms are presented to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, and report operational risk events to each business and support area (first line), in addition to disseminating the control culture to other employees. The main results of risk assessments are presented in the Technical Forum on Operational Risk and Internal Controls and in the Risk Committee, when applicable. Applicable improvement recommendations result in action plans with planned deadlines and responsibilities. &nbsp; &nbsp; 72 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; Information Technology/Cyber (&quot;IT&quot;) risk IT/Cyber risk is defined as the undesirable effects arising from a range of possible threats to the information technology infrastructure, including cybersecurity (occurrence of information security incidents), incident management (ineffective incident/problem management process, impact about service levels, costs and customer dissatisfaction), identity and access management (unauthorized access to sensitive information), data management (lack of compliance with data privacy laws or gaps in data management governance or data leakage issues), among others. &nbsp; As the Group operates in a challenging environment in terms of cyber threats, it continuously invests in controls and technologies to defend against these threats. IT risks, including cyber risk, are a priority area for Nu, thus there is a dedicated IT Risk structure, which is part of the second line. This team is independent from IT-related areas, including Engineering, IT Operations, and Information Security. &nbsp; The IT/Cyber Risks area is responsible for identifying, evaluating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting Information Technology risks in relation to the risk appetite levels approved by the Executive Board. The Group continually assesses Nu's exposure to threat risk and their potential impacts on the business and customers. The Group continues to improve its IT and cybersecurity capabilities and controls, also considering that people are an essential component of the security strategy, ensuring that the employees and third-party consultants are aware of prevention measures and also know how to report incidents. &nbsp; The results of the IT risk and controls assessments are regularly discussed at the IT Risk Technical Forum and presented to the Risk Committee when applicable. The applicable improvement recommendations result in action plans with planned deadlines and responsibilities. &nbsp; &#9679; Regulatory risk &nbsp; In a complex and highly regulated environment, legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in significant changes to Nu's regulatory framework and consequently its business activities. &nbsp; To address such risks Nu maintains teams in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico dedicated to monitoring these changes and engaging to explain their potential impacts to the Group and the broader financial industry. &nbsp; Legislative and regulatory initiatives that can present a material impact to the Group are brought to the attention of the Risk Committee and the management team allowing the Group, when necessary, to adjust its strategy and decide on the best course of action to deal with such changes. &#9679; Compliance risk As the Group operates in a highly regulated environment, a robust Compliance program was established within the second line of defense. Nu has resources dedicated to the Ethics Program, Regulatory Compliance as well as to Anti Money Laundering Program and Combating the Financing of Terrorism. The Ethics Program sets the minimum conduct standards for the organization, including Code of Conduct, Compliance Policies, Training, and Awareness Campaigns, as well as an independent Whistleblower Channel. Some examples include the anti-bribery and corruption risks, conflict of interest, related parties, insider trading as well as any violations from Nu's Code of Conduct. &nbsp; &nbsp; 73 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Regulatory Compliance team is focused on overseeing the regulatory adherence of the organization. Main activities involve regulatory tracking and managing the regulatory adherence, assessment of new products and features, advisory, Compliance testing as well as centralizing the relationship with regulators regarding requests of information and exams. By not being in compliance with laws and regulations, the Group may be exposed to sanctions, loss of license as well as potential criminal implications on management. &nbsp; Nu's Anti Money Laundering (AML) Program represents the global framework and guidelines for AML and Combating Terrorism Financing (CTF) and is the basis for the AML team's strategic planning. It involves the risk of the company being exposed to sanctions for not implementing controls to avoid AML or terrorism financing. &nbsp; The Program is structured in three levels - strategic, tactical and operational - and it's composed of 7 pillars (strategic level): Enterprise Risk Assessment; Policies and Procedures; Communication and Training; Know Your Customer (KYC); Due Diligence (KYE, KYS, KYP and KYB); MSAC - Monitoring, Selection, Analysis and Communication (SAR); and Effectiveness Assessment Program. &nbsp; &#9679; Reputational risk &nbsp; The Group believes that the materialization of other risks can negatively impact its reputation, as they are intrinsically connected. Unfavorable events in different risk areas such as business continuity, cyber security, ethics and integrity, social media negative activity, among others, can damage Nu's reputation. &nbsp; Therefore, the Group has teams and processes in place dedicated to overseeing external communication and for crisis management, which are key elements in identifying and mitigating reputational events, as well as to gain long-term insight to better prevent or respond to future events. &nbsp; Risks from cryptocurrency business &nbsp; In addition to the risks set out above, the Group's activities and services related to cryptocurrency (NuCrypto) generate specific risks which are directly related to cryptocurrency technology. NuCrypto utilizes the services of an agent in the operation and management of the cryptocurrency business activity. The Group keeps a copy of the records maintained by the agent as well as its own internal tracking of customers' assets for reconciliation purposes. NuCrypto may have a liability to indemnify customers under consumer protection laws (like any other supplier of goods and services in Brazil) but the agent is obligated to secure the assets and protect them from loss and theft. Furthermore, the agent holds insurance for potential losses which the Group would seek to make claims upon if required, with any benefit obtained being transferred to impacted customers. &nbsp; Stress testing &nbsp; The stress testing program considers shocks/impacts to Nu's main products, such as credit cards, personal loans and funding instruments, in addition to their respective sub-products. Scenarios are considered in which stress is applied in isolation, at different levels of intensity and probability, and also scenarios in which managerial actions are considered to increase the Group's resilience and preserve its capital and liquidity indicators. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 74 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The proposed scenarios are presented to the Stress Testing Technical Forum. The scenarios to be addressed, duration and severity and plausibility of each shock are discussed, as well as the ways in which they will be modeled and the level of detail required. After modeling and executing the tests, the results are submitted to the appropriate committees and technical forums, an integral part of Nu's risk management structure. The proposed actions aimed at ensuring the Group's resilience are discussed and approved. The Stress Testing Program is updated annually and defines which tests the team must undertake in the next 12 months. &nbsp; &nbsp; 30. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT &nbsp; The purpose of capital management is to maintain the capital adequacy for Nu's operation through control and monitoring of the capital position, to evaluate the capital necessity according to the risk taken and strategic aim of the organization and to establish a capital planning process in accordance with future requirements of regulatory capital, based on the Group's growth projections, risk exposure, market movements and other relevant information. Also, the capital management structure is responsible for identifying sources of capital, for writing and submitting the capital plan and capital contingent plan for approval by the Executive Directors. &nbsp; At the executive level, the ALM Technical Forum is responsible for approving risk assessment and capital calculation methodologies, and reviewing, monitoring, and recommending capital-related action plans to the Risk Committee. &nbsp; a) Minimum capital requirements &nbsp; In Brazil, the local entities must comply with two different regulatory capital requirements: one for the Financial Conglomerate, led by Nu Financeira and composed of Nu Financeira along with Nu DTVM and Nu Invest, and the other applicable to Nu Pagamentos: &nbsp; &#9679; Financial Conglomerate: minimum level of capital, considering the minimum requirements for financial institutions according to Brazilian Federal Monetary Council (&#8220;CMN&#8221;) Resolution 4,958/21. &#9679; Nu Pagamentos: minimum level of capital, considering the minimum requirements for payment institutions, according to Circular BACEN 3,681/13. In March 2022, BACEN issued Resolution No. 200 which provides new prudential rules for payment institutions requiring a phased implementation that foresees an increase in the capital requirements applicable to credit card operations in Brazil. The Group's management understands that its capital is adequate to comply with the requirement of this new resolution. &nbsp; In September 2021, Nu acquired Nu Mexico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P., formerly AKALA, S.A. DE C.V., (&#8220;Akala&#8221;), a Mexican Financial Cooperative Association (&quot;SOFIPO&quot;) and regulated by the CNBV (Comisi&oacute;n Nacional Bancaria Y De Valores). The regulatory capital requirements for this entity are defined by the NICAP metric (&#8220;nivel de capitalizaci&oacute;n&#8221;) set by the CNBV, which is comparable to the Basel Ratio methodology. &nbsp; &nbsp; 75 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Colombia is in the process of requesting a license from the SFC (&quot;Superintendencia financiera de Colombia&quot;), &quot; Licencia de Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de financiamiento&quot;, which would allow it to offer several consumer credit and deposit products. In August 2022 the SFC granted the incorporation license for &#8220;Nu Colombia Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Financiamiento S.A.&#8221;, and by the end of October 2022 the incorporation was completed. The next step is to receive the operational license. Once &#8220;Nu Colombia Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Financiamiento S.A.'' becomes operational, the regulator requires it to comply with the capital ratio defined in &#8220;Ley de margen de solvencia&#8221; which indicates three capital ratios: basic solvency, additional basic solvency and total solvency. &nbsp; Nu implemented a capital management structure with the purpose of maintaining a higher level of capital than the minimum regulatory requirements. &nbsp; b) Composition of capital &nbsp; i) Financial conglomerate in Brazil &nbsp; The regulatory capital used to monitor the compliance of a financial conglomerate with the Basel operating limits imposed by the Brazilian Central Bank, is the sum of two items, as follows: &#9679; Tier I Capital: the sum of Common Equity Capital Tier I, which consists of paid in capital, capital, reserves and retained earnings, less deductions, and prudential adjustments and the Additional Tier I, which consists of subordinated debt instruments without a defined maturity that meet eligibility requirements. &#9679; Tier II Capital: consists of subordinated debt instruments with defined maturity dates that meet eligibility requirements. Together with the Common Equity Tier I it composes the Total Capital. &nbsp; &nbsp; 76 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

SEGMENT INFORMATION &nbsp; In reviewing the operational performance of the Group and allocating resources, the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group (&#8220;CODM&#8221;), who is the Group&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;), reviews the consolidated statement of profit (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). &nbsp; The CODM considers the whole Group as a single operating and reportable segment, monitoring operations, making decisions on fund allocation, and evaluating performance.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS &nbsp; a) Accounting for crypto-assets - Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&quot;SAB 121&quot;) &nbsp; In March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which addresses the rights and obligations of the parties to a crypto asset safeguarding arrangement. SAB 121 explains that an issuer that has obligations to safeguard digital assets held for their platform users should recognize those digital assets and a liability to return them to the customers, both of which are measured at fair value. &nbsp; In June 2022, the Group launched a platform, through its subsidiary Nu Crypto Ltda. (&quot;Nu Crypto&quot;), which allows clients to trade crypto assets, in partnership with a specialized broker. The custody activity is performed by the broker, which holds the cryptographic key information, and the Company's contractual arrangements state that its customers retain legal ownership of the crypto; have the right to sell or transfer the crypto assets; and also benefit from the rewards and bear the risks associated with the ownership, including as a result of any crypto price fluctuations. The Company maintains an internal recordkeeping of the crypto assets held for the customers. &nbsp; The Group concluded that its activities may create crypto-asset safeguarding obligations (as defined in SAB 121) to its customers as a result of certain technological, legal and regulatory risks and, therefore, it should record a safeguarding liability and a corresponding asset at the fair value of the crypto assets held by customers on the Group&#8217;s platform. &nbsp; The following table summarizes the balances relating to crypto assets held for customers. For the purpose of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which were prepared to specifically attend CVM requirements, the asset and liability have not been recognized. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 03/31/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 Fair value of the crypto assets held for customers &nbsp; 30,472 &nbsp; 18,313 &nbsp; 79 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.
