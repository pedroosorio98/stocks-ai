Annual Shareholder Meeting June 22, 2023 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters in this presentation including, but not limited to, statements as to: the performance, impact, and benefits of our products and technologies; our growth and growth opportunities; our market opportunities; our strategies; and other predictions and estimates are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements and any other forward-looking statements that go beyond historical facts that are made in this presentation are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners' products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences and demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems and other factors. NVIDIA has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely upon the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The future events and trends discussed in this presentation may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward- looking statements. Although NVIDIA believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the company cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. For a complete discussion of factors that could materially affect our financial results and operations, please refer to the reports we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Copies of reports we file with the SEC are posted on our website and are available from NVIDIA without charge. NVIDIA uses certain non-GAAP measures in this presentation including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP earnings per share. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances investors' overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Further information relevant to the interpretation of non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, may be found in the slide titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures”.
