NVIDIA uses certain non-GAAP measures in this presentation including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances investors' overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Further information relevant to the interpretation of non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, may be found in the slide titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures.” NVIDIA’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, revolutionized accelerated computing, ignited the era of modern AI, and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. Today, two transitions are occurring simultaneously—accelerated computing and generative AI—transforming the computer industry and every other industry worldwide, and NVIDIA is enabling these transitions with our full-stack computing platform and data-center-scale offerings. NVIDIA’s platform is installed in several hundred million computers, is available in every cloud and from every server maker, powers over 75% of the TOP500 supercomputers, and has ~5.9 million developers.

Accelerated computing requires full-stack innovation— optimizing across every layer of computing—from chips and systems to software and algorithms, demanding deep understanding of the problem domain. Our platform extends from the cloud and enterprise data centers to supercomputing, edge computing, PCs, and robotics. What Is Accelerated Computing? Not just a superfast chip—accelerated computing is a full-stack combination of: • Chip(s) with specialized processors • Algorithms in acceleration libraries • Domain experts to refactor applications To speed up compute-intensive parts of an application A full-stack approach: silicon, systems, software For example: • If 90% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 9X • If 99% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 50X • If 80% of the runtime can be accelerated by 500X, or even 1,000X, the application is sped up 5X Amdahl’s law: The overall system speed-up (S) gained by optimizing a single part of a system by a factor (s) is limited by the proportion of execution time of that part (p). 𝑆 = 1 1 − 𝑝 + 𝑝 𝑠 Why Accelerated Computing? Accelerated computing is needed to tackle the most impactful opportunities of our time—like AI, climate simulation, drug discovery, ray tracing, and robotics. NVIDIA is uniquely dedicated to accelerated computing —working top-to-bottom, refactoring applications and creating new algorithms, and bottom-to-top inventing new specialized processors, like RT Cores and Tensor Cores.

Specialized for fields such as software development, legal services or education and can boost productivity by as much as 50%. Social media, search, and e-commerce apps are using deep recommenders to offer more relevant content and ads to their customers, increasing engagement and monetization. Creators can generate stunning, photorealistic images with a single text prompt—compressing workflows that take days or weeks into minutes in industries from advertising to game development. Call center agents augmented with AI chatbots can dramatically increase productivity and customer satisfaction. Drug discovery and financial services are seeing order-of-magnitude workflow acceleration from AI. Manufacturing workflows are reinvented and automated through generative AI and robotics, boosting productivity.

Generative AI is trained on large amounts of data to find patterns and relationships, learning the representation of almost anything with structure. It can then be prompted to generate text, images, video, code, or even proteins. For the very first time, computers can augment the human ability to generate information and create. 1,600+ generative AI companies are building on NVIDIA.

Their purpose is not to store user and company data or run ERP and CRM applications. AI factories are highly optimized systems purpose-built to process raw data, refine it into models, and produce monetizable tokens with great scale and efficiency. In the AI industrial revolution, data is the raw material, tokens are the new commodity, and NVIDIA is the token generator in the AI factory. Every company will produce digital intelligence. Tokens will be transformed into intelligent responses and actions of digital nurses, tutors, customer service agents, chip designers, manufacturing robots and autonomous cars, Weather prediction agents will warn us of storms. Some companies will build and operate AI factories, while others will rent. Countries are awakening to the need to treat their data as a national resource and AI factories as an essential national infrastructure. Data encodes a nation's history, knowledge, and culture, and can be transformed into the sovereign AI for its companies, startups, universities, and governments. NVIDIA builds the complete AI system and licenses NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the AI stack and operating system for AI factories.

Software is not automatically accelerated in the presence of a GPU or accelerator. NVIDIA CUDA libraries encapsulate NVIDIA-engineered algorithms that enable applications to be accelerated on NVIDIA’s installed base. They deliver dramatically higher performance—compared to CPU-only alternatives—across application domains, including AI and high-performance computing, and significantly reduce runtime, cost, and energy, while increasing scale. With over 400 CUDA libraries, NVIDIA can address many major workloads across a wide range of industries. As new libraries become available, they unlock new markets adding to our long-term opportunity.

Physical AI will embody robotic systems—from autonomous vehicles to industrial robots and humanoids, to warehouses and factories. Three computers and software stacks are required to build physical AI: NVIDIA AI on DGX to train the AI model, NVIDIA Omniverse on OVX to teach, test, and validate the AI model's skills, and NVIDIA AGX to run the AI software on the robot. Enterprises license NVIDIA Omniverse at $4,500 per GPU per year. Sovereign AI Nations produce AI using their own data, infrastructure, workforce, and business networks Japan National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) Switzerland Swisscom Group Ecuador Telconet Singapore Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel) France Scaleway Vietnam FPT Smart Cloud Spain Barcelona Supercomputing Center Location of NVIDIA sovereign AI partners Sovereign AI Nations are awakening to the imperative to produce AI using their own infrastructure, data, workforces, and business networks. Nations are building domestic computing capacity. Some governments operate sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state- owned telecommunications providers or utilities. Other governments partner with local cloud providers to deliver a shared AI computing infrastructure for public and private-sector use. NVIDIA’s ability to help build AI infrastructure with our end-to-end compute-to-networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jump-start their countries’ AI ambitions. $6,803 $12,690 $9,040 $37,134 $86,789 41% 47% 34% 61% 67% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% $0 $10,000 $20,000 $30,000 $40,000 $50,000 $60,000 $70,000 $80,000 $90,000 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 Operating Income (Non-GAAP, $M) Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) $16,675 $26,914 $26,974 $60,922 $130,497 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 Driving Strong and Profitable Growth Fiscal year ends in January.
