Importantly, we continue to make all the investments that we need to grow our businesses and serve our customers, and we hope to be able to resume stock buybacks early next year.” “In Consumer & Community Banking, we again ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits, we were the fastest growing bank among the top 20 and we are now #1 in the top 3 largest markets based on the most recent FDIC data. Average deposits were up 9%, and debit and credit card sales were up 13%. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, we maintained our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking although fees were down 47% compared to a record prior year. Markets revenue grew 8% driven by strong client activity in Fixed Income. Commercial Banking loans were up 13% on higher revolver utilization and new loan originations. Asset & Wealth Management reported solid results with revenue up 6% as higher net interest income more than offset the impact of lower market levels.” “In the U.S., consumers continue to spend with solid balance sheets, job openings are plentiful and businesses remain healthy. However, there are significant headwinds immediately in front of us – stubbornly high inflation leading to higher global interest rates, the uncertain impacts of quantitative tightening, the war in Ukraine, which is increasing all geopolitical risks, and the fragile state of oil supply and prices. While we are hoping for the best, we always remain vigilant and are prepared for bad outcomes so we can continue to serve customers even in the most challenging of times.” Dimon concluded: “Year to date, our employees have worked hard to extend credit and raise $1.9 trillion in capital for small and large businesses, governments and U.S. consumers. The investments we have made over the years, the discipline and rigor with which we manage the Firm, and the extraordinary efforts by our people have enabled us to consistently serve our customers, clients and communities around the world.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 3Q22 results included: n $959 million net investment securities losses in Corporate ($0.24 decrease in earnings per share) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.0 billion, or $1 per share n Net payout LTM 7,8 of 43% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $87.00, up 1%; tangible book value per share 2 of $69.90, flat YoY n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 3 of $210 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 12.5%; Advanced ratio3 of 13.0% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.3% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 3Q22 expense of $19.2 billion; reported overhead ratio of 59%; managed overhead ratio2 of 57% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $1.9 trillion of credit and capital9 raised YTD n $196 billion of credit for consumers n $24 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $799 billion of credit for corporations n $799 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $51 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the third quarter of 2022 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net interest income (NII) was $17.6 billion, up 34%. NII excluding Markets2 was $16.9 billion, up 51%, driven by higher rates.

The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, including a net reserve build of $808 million. Net charge-offs of $727 million were up $203 million.

News Release 5 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 87.00, $ 86.38 and $ 86.36 at September 30, 2022 , June 30, 2022 , and September 30, 2021 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2021 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
