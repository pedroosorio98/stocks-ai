(NYSE: JPM) today reported 2008 first- quarter net income of $2.4 billi on, compared with record net income of $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2007. Earnings per share of $0.68 were down 49%, compared with record earnings per share of $1.34 in the first quarter of 2007. Commenting on the quarter, Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our earnings this quarter were down significantly as market conditions and the credit environment remained challenging. The Investment Bank ha d markdowns related to leveraged lending and mortgages and increased loan loss reserves. Retail Financial Services again increased loan loss reserves related to home equity and subprime mortgages, as pe rformance in these portfolios continued to deteriorate. However, the firm as a whole maintained solid business momentum and our capital position remained strong. Retail Financial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services a ll reported organic reve nue growth and well- managed expense levels. We also added $2.5 bil lion to our allowance for credit losses (which now totals $12.6 billion), and maintained a strong 8.3% Tier 1 capital ratio.” Commenting on the recent agreement to acquire Bear Stearns, Mr. Dimon remarked, “The Bear Stearns merger provides a unique opportunity to enhance our ability to serve clients by adding new capabilities in prime brokerage and clearing and by improving strength in equities, mortgage trading, commodities and asset manage ment. We welcome the employees of Bear Stearns and look forward to working together to build increased franchise value.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release Discussing the firm’s outlook, Dimon said, “Our expectation is for the economic environment to continue to be weak and for the capital ma rkets to remain under stress. These factors have affected, and are likely to continue to negati vely impact, our firm’s credit losses, overall business volumes and earnings -- possibly thr ough the remainder of the year, or longer. However, we are prepared to manage through th is down part of the economic cycle, given the strength of our liquidity, credit reserves, capital and operating margins, and to successfully position our company well for the future.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d JPMorgan Chase, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 12). The following discussion compares the first quarter of 2008 with the first quarter of 2007 unless otherwise noted.

The lower results reflected a decline in net revenue and a higher provision for credit losses offset partially by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $3.0 billion, a decline of $3.2 billion, or 52%, from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.2 billion, down 30% from the prior year, reflecting lower debt and equity underwriting fees. Debt underwriting fees of $364 million declined 58%, reflecting lower bond underwriting and loan syndication fees, which we re negatively affected by market conditions. Equity underwriting fees were $359 million, down 9% from the prior year. Advisory fees of $483 million were up slightly from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $466 million, down $2.1 billion, or 82%, from the prior year. The decline was due primarily to markdowns of $1.2 billion on prime, Alt-A a nd subprime mortgages; markdowns of $1.1 billion on leveraged lending funded and unf unded commitments; and markdowns of $266 million on collateralized debt obligation (CDO) warehouses and unsold positions. These markdowns were offset partially by record reve nue in rates and currencies. Equity Markets revenue was $1.0 billion, down 37% from the prior year, as weak trading results were offset partially by strong client revenue across businesses. Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets results included a combined benefit of $949 million from the widening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, with an impact of $662 million and $287 million, respectively. Credit Portfolio revenue was $363 million, down $31 million, or 8%, from the prior year. 2 2 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release The provision for credit losses was $618 million, comp ared with $63 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects an increas e of $605 million in the allowance for credit losses, reflecting the impact of the transfer of $4.9 billion of leveraged lending commitments to retained loans from held-for-sale loans and the effect of a weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $13 million, compared with net recoveries of $6 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to to tal loans retained was 2.55% for th e current quarter, an increase from 1.76% in the prior year. Average loans retained were $74.1 billion, an increase of $15.1 bil lion, or 26%, from the prior year, principally driven by grow th in acquisition finance activity, including leveraged lending. Average fair value and held-for-sale loans were $19.6 billion, up $5.9 billion, or 43%, from the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billio n, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 33%, from the prior year. The decline was due to lower performance-based compensation expense.

Net revenue was $4.7 billion, an increase of $5 96 million, or 15%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $394 million, or 15%, due to increased loan balances, wider loan spreads, and higher deposit balances. These benefits were offset partially by a shift to narrower–spread deposit products. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, up $202 million, or 14%, driven by higher volume and improved margin s on mortgage loan originations, increased deposit-related fees and the absence of a pr ior-year charge resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuity contracts. Thes e benefits were offset partially by markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline and a decrease in net mortgage servicing revenue. The provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion, compared with $292 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision includes an increase of $1.1 billion in the allowance for loan losses related to home equity loans. Housing price declines have continued to exceed expectations resulting in a significant increase in estimated losses, particularly for high loan-to- 3 3 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release value second-lien loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $447 million (1.89% net charge-off rate), compared with $68 million (0.32% net ch arge-off rate) in the prior year. The current- quarter provision also includes a $417 million increase in the allowance for loan losses related to subprime mortgage loans, reflecting an in crease in estimated losses for this portfolio. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $149 m illion (3.82% net charge-off rate), compared with $20 million (0.92% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. The provision was also affected by an increase in the allowance for credit losses for prime mortgage and auto loans. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, an increas e of $163 million, or 7%, from the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage produc tion and servicing expense, a nd investment in the retail distribution network. Regional Banking net loss was $433 million, compared with net income of $690 million in the prior year, reflecting a significant increase in the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $3.4 billion, up $329 million, or 11%, benefiting fr om higher loan balances, wider loan spreads, increased deposit-related fees and higher deposit balan ces. Net revenue also benefited from the absence of a prior-year charge relate d to accelerated surrenders of customer annuity contracts. These benefits were offset partially by a shift to narrower– spread deposit products. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2007, net re venue in the current qua rter also benefited from the seasonal tax-refund an ticipation business. The provisi on for credit losses was $2.3 billion, compared with $233 million in the prior year. The increase in the provision was due to weakness in the home equity and subprime mortga ge portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up $65 million, or 4%, from the prior year due to investme nt in the retail distribution network. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Checking accounts totaled 11.1 million, up 910,000, or 9%.  Average total deposits grew to $214.3 billion, up $7.8 billion, or 4%.  Average home equity loans were $95.0 billion, up $8.7 billion, or 10%.  Average business banking loans were $15.6 billion, up 9% and originations were $1.8 billion, up 9%.  Number of branches grew to 3,146, up 75.  Branch sales of credit cards increased 18%.  Branch sales of investment products declined 15%.  Overhead ratio (excluding amortizat ion of core deposit intangibles) decreased to 50% from 52%. Mortgage Banking net income was $132 million, compared with $84 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $751 million, up $147 million, or 24%. Net revenue comprises production revenue and net mortgage servicing reve nue. Production revenue was $576 million, up $176 million, primarily benefiting from higher volume and improved margins on mortgage loan originations, partially offset by markdowns on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline. In addition, the benefit of the one-time impact from the adoption of SAB 109 (“Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earn ings”) in the current quarter was offset by the absence of the prior-year impact of the adoption of SFAS 159 (“Fair Value Option”). Net mortgage servicing revenue, which includes lo an servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $175 million, compared with $204 million in the prior year. Loan servicing revenue of $634 m illion increased by $33 million on growth of 15% in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management results were negative $34 million 4 4 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release compared with negative $19 million in the prior year. Other change s in fair value of the MSR asset were negative $425 million compared with negative $378 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $536 million, an incr ease of $68 million, or 15%. The increase reflected higher production expense due primar ily to growth in originations and higher servicing costs due to increased delinquencies and defaults. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Mortgage loan originations were $47.1 billion, up 30% from the prior year and 18% from the prior quarter.  Total third-party mortgage loans se rviced were $627.1 billion, an increase of $81.0 billion, or 15%. Auto Finance net income was $74 million, a decrease of $11 million, or 13%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $530 million, up $120 million, or 29%, reflecting a reduction in residual value reserves for direct finance leases, higher automobile operating lease revenue, higher loan balances and wider loan spreads. The provi sion for credit losses was $168 million, up $109 million. The current-quarter provision included an increase in the allowance for credit losses, reflecting higher estimated losses. The net charge-off rate was 1.10%, compared with 0.59% in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $240 m illion grew $30 million, or 14%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $609 million, a decline of $156 million, or 20%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by growth in managed net revenue. End-of-period managed loans of $150.9 billion gr ew $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior year and declined $6.1 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior quarter reflects seasonally lower sales volume and highe r payment activity. Average managed loans of $153.6 billion increased $4.1 billion, or 3%, from th e prior year and $1.8 billion, or 1%, from the prior quarter. The increases from the prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans reflects organic portfolio growth. 5 5 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release Managed net revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of $224 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, up $196 milli on, or 7%, from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was driven by wider loan spreads, an increased level of fees and higher average managed loan balances. These benefits were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with increased charge-offs and the discontinuation of certain billing practices (including the elimination of ce rtain over-limit fees and the two-cycle billing method for calculating finance charges beginning in the second quarter of 2007). Noninterest revenue was $719 million, an increase of $28 milli on, or 4%, from the prior year. The increase is primarily related to higher net securitization gains. Charge volume growth of 5% reflected a 10% increase in sales volume, partially offset by a lower level of balance transfers, the result of more targeted marketing efforts. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 7 billion, an increase of $441 million, or 36%, from the prior year, due to a higher level of charge-offs and an $85 million prior-year release of the allowance for loan losse s. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 4.37%, up from 3.57% in the prior year and 3.89% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.66%, up from 3.07% in the prior year and 3.48% in the prior quarter.

The increase was driven by double- 6 6 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release digit growth in liability and loan balances, primarily offset by spread compression in the liability and loan portfolios and a continued shift to narrower–spr ead liability products. Noninterest revenue was $334 million, flat compared with the prior year, reflecting lower gains related to the sale of securities acquired in the satisfaction of debt and lower investment banking fees, offset by higher deposit-related, credit card and lending fees. Middle Market Banking revenue was $706 million, an increase of $45 million, or 7%, from the prior year. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was $207 million, a d ecrease of $5 million, or 2%. Real Estate Banking revenue was $97 million, a decline of $5 million, or 5%. The provision for credit losses was $101 million, comp ared with $17 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision largely reflects gr owth in loan balances and the effect of the weakening credit environment. The allowance for loan losses to total loans retained was 2.65% for the current quarter, down fr om 2.68% in the prio r year and 2.66% in the prior quarter.

Net revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of $387 million, or 25%, from the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue of $1.1 billion was up $26 3 million, or 31%. The growth was driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients (primarily in custody, fund and alternative investments services and depositary receip ts) and wider spreads in securities lending and foreign exchange driv en by recent market conditions. These benefits 7 7 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release were offset partially by spread compression on liability products. Treasury Services net revenue was $813 million, an increase of $124 m illion, or 18%, from the prior year. This increase reflected higher liability balances and wider market-driven spreads, as well as growth in electronic and trade loan volumes.

Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.5 billion, up $193 million, or 15%. Compared with the prior quarter, TSS net revenue decreased $17 million, or 1%, primarily due to spread compression on liability balances, lo wer equity markets and the absence of fourth- quarter seasonal depositary rece ipts activity.

Compared with the fourth quarter of 2007, net income of $356 million declined $171 million, or 32%, primarily driven by seasonality in the recognition of performance fees and a decline in assets under management due to lower market levels. Net revenue of $1.9 billion was flat compared with the prior year.

Net interest income was $311 million, up $66 million, or 27%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher deposit and loan balances. Private Bank revenue grew 17% to $655 million due to higher assets under management and increased deposit and loan balances, partially o ffset by lower performance and placement fees. Institutional revenue declined 11% to $490 million du e to lower performa nce fees, partially offset by growth in assets under management.

Excluding the impact of the sale of Visa shares, the decrease in net income was driven by lower results in Private Equity, lower net revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses both in Corporate. These lower results were offset partially by a net release of litigation reserves. Net income for Private Equity was $57 million, compared with $698 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $163 million, a decrease of $ 1.1 billion. The decline was driven by lower Private Equity gains of $189 million, compared with gains of $1.3 billion in the prior year, which included a fair value adjustment rela ted to the adoption of SFAS 157 (“Fair Value Measurements”). Noninterest expense was $76 m illion, a decline of $88 million from the prior year, reflecting lower compensation expense.

Net re venue (excluding the effect of Visa sales proceeds) was negative $303 million, compared with $15 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to a narrower net interest spre ad and trading losses. The provision for credit losses was $196 million, compared with $3 million in the prior year, largely reflecting an increase in the allowance for loan losses for prime mortgages. Noninterest expense was negative $576 million, compared with $190 million in the prior year, reflecting a release of credit card-related litigation reserves and the absence of prior-year merger expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Private Equity portfolio was $6.6 bil lion, up from $6.4 billion in the prior year and down from $7.2 billion in the prior quarter. The portfolio represented 8.3% of stockholders’ equity less goodwill, down from 8.8% in the prior year and 9.2% in the prior quarter. 10 10 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP bas is was $16,890 million, $17,384 million and $18,968 million for the first quarter of 2008, fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2007, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $2.4 billion, down $2.4 billion from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit lo sses and lower managed net revenue offset partially by a decrease in noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $17.9 billion, down $1.8 billion, or 9%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $8.5 billion was down $3.7 billion, or 31%, due to lower principal transactions revenue, which reflected markdowns on prime and Alt-A mortgages and markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments. In addition, lower levels of private equity gains and inve stment banking fees contributed to the decline in noninterest revenue. The decline was offset partially by proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering, and an increase in asset management, administration and commissions revenue, reflecting growth in assets under custody and manage ment and higher brokerage commissions. Net interest income was $9.4 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 25%, due to higher trading-related net interest income, wider spre ads on higher balances of consumer loans and higher deposit balances. These benefits were offset partially by spread compression on deposit products. The managed provision for credit losses was $5.1 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior year. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $747 million, compared with $77 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses, primarily related to the transfer of funded and unfunded leveraged lendi ng commitments to retained loans from held- for-sale and to portfolio activity. In addition, th e allowance reflected the effect of a weakening credit environment. Wholesale net charge-offs were $92 million, compared with net recoveries of $6 million, resulting in net charge-off and re covery rates of 0.18% and 0.02%, respectively. The total consumer-managed provision for cred it losses was $4.4 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses largely related to home equity and subprime mortgage loans and higher net charge-offs. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $2.5 billion, compared with $ 1.5 billion, resulting in a managed net charge- off rate of 2.68% and 1.81%, resp ectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $5.4 billion at March 31, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $2.4 billion. 11 11 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release Noninterest expense was $8.9 bi llion, down $1.7 billion, or 16% , from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower performance-base d compensation and a net reduction in litigation expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.3% at March 31, 2008 (estimated), 8.4% at December 31, 2007, and 8.5% at March 31, 2007.  Headcount of 182,166 grew 5,852 since March 31, 2007.  Announced the planned acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., pursuant to a merger agreement dated March 16, 2008, and as amended on March 24, 2008. The agreement calls fo r each share of Bear Stearns common stock to be exchanged for 0.21753 shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock. The transaction is expected to close by June 30, 2008. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business’ results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes th e impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made ab out allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receiva bles to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sh eet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordin gly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Ea rnings Release Financial Supplement (first quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. 12 12 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release JPMorgan Chase & Co.
