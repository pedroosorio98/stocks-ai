The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis. (b) Pre-provision profit, TBVPS and ROTCE are each non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) is also a non-GAAP financial measure; refer to page 9 for a reconciliation of common stockholders’ equity to TCE. Refer to page 28 for a further discussion of these measures. (c) Refer to Reconciliation from Reported to Managed Basis on page 7 for a further discussion of managed basis. (d) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (e) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $3.8 billion, $4.5 billion, $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. The SLR prior to the periods ended June 30, 2021 reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics.

For the periods ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $3.8 billion, $4.5 billion, $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. The SLR prior to the periods ended June 30, 2021 reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021.

Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions; the restrictions were extended and expired at the end of the second quarter of 2021. The Firm’s Board of Directors authorized a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion. (b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee stock options and SARs. Page 10 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

(b) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans, loans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for-investment loans and overdrafts. (c) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value primarily reflect lending related positions originated and purchased in CIB Markets, including loans held for securitization.

(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB. (c) Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $2 million, $21 million, $28 million and $15 million, CIB trading VaR of $(1) million, $19 million, $24 million and $11 million, and CIB VaR of zero, $20 million, $24 million and $12 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, respectively. (d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 137–139 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K, and pages 66–68 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 for further information. (e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated. (f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. Page 17 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

Page 27 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures (a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. (b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. (d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio. (e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown below; these metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics that exclude CIB Markets are referred to as non-markets-related net interest income and net yield. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets-related net interest income and net yield provides investors and analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.
