INVESTMENT BANK (IB) Operating Results –IB 2Q05 3Q04 ($ millions) 3Q05 2Q05 3Q04 $ O/(U) % O/(U) $ O/(U) % O/(U) Net Revenue $4,461 $2,750 $2,701 $1,711 62% $1,760 65% Provision for Credit Losses (46) (343) (151) 297 87 105 70 Noninterest Expense 2,875 2,178 1,924 697 32 951 49 Operating Earnings $1,063 $606 $627 $457 75% $436 70% Discussion of Results: Operating earnings of $1.1 billion were strong, up $436 million, or 70%, from the prior year and 75% from the prior quarter. Th e increases were driven primarily by record trading revenues of $2.4 billion, up $1.6 billion from the prior year and $1.8 billion from the pr ior quarter. Trading results were strong across all trading areas. In addition, results benefited from continued strength in investment banking fees. Partially offsetting the improved revenues were higher performance- based incentive compensation and a reduced benefit from the loan loss provision. Net revenue of $4.5 billion was a quarterly recor d, up $1.8 billion, or 65%, from the prior year and up 62% from the prior quarter. Investment banking fees of $985 million were up 8% from the prior year showing continue d strength. Europe was a strong contributor to these results, benefiting from the joint venture with Cazenove. Advisory fees of $300 million were up 10% over the prior year. Debt underwriting fees of $475 million were roughly flat to the prior year, while equity underwriting fees of $210 million we re up 24% over the prior year and more than doubled versus last quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $2.4 billion represented a record quarter, more than double the prior year and up 71%, or $1.0 billion, from the prior quarter. The increase over both periods was driven by strong tr ading results in all areas, with particular strength in energy, an area of significant investment . Client-related and proprietary trading were very strong across all asset cla sses. Equity Markets revenue of $713 million increased by $258 million, or 57%, over the prior year and $641 mill ion over the prior quarter. This performance was driven primarily by improved trading results across regions and by higher commissions. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $46 million, compared with a benefit of $151 million in the prior year and a $343 million benefit in the prior quarter. Th e benefit reflects the continued strong quality of the credit portfolio. Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up $951 milli on, or 49%, from the prior year and up $697 million, or 32%, from the prior quarter. The incr ease in both periods was primarily driven by higher performance-based incentive compensation. The comparison to the prior year was also affected by the joint venture with Cazenove, which closed in the first quarter of 2005. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Other Highlights Include:  Return on equity was 21% for the quarter.  Ranked #2 in Investment Banking Fees generated for the first nine months of 2005, according to Dealogic.  Ranked #1 in Global Syndicated Loans, #3 in Global Announced M&A, #4 in Global Long Term Debt and #6 in Global Equity and Equity-Related, according to Thomson Financial, for the first nine months of 2005.  Completed the acquisition of Neovest, a provider of high-performance trading technology and direct market access.  Average loans of $58.3 billion were up $6.9 billion from th e prior quarter, reflecting an 11% increase in Credit Portfolio loans.  Allowance for loan losses to averag e loans was 2.45%; nonperforming assets were $934 million, down 29% from the prior year.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings of $656 million were down $166 million, or 20%, from the prior year. Results reflected a special provision for credit losses of $250 million attributable to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the impact of the special provision, operating earnings would have been $811 million, down $11 million, or 1%. Performance reflected lower MSR risk management results, a net loss associated with the tr ansfer of auto loans to held -for-sale, and narrower spreads on consumer real estate loans. Earnings benefited from favorable credit trends and lower expenses due to merger-related expense savings and other efficiencies . Production results were strong across most product offerings and included year-over-year increases of 8% in checking accounts, 15% in mortgage originations and 8% in average home equity balances. Net revenue was down 6%, or $210 million, from the prior year, to $3.6 billion. Net interest income of $2.5 billion declined by $194 million, pr imarily due to both narrower spreads on consumer real estate loans and the absence of lo an portfolios sold in late 2004 and early 2005. These decreases were partially offset by higher mortgage and home equity balances. Noninterest revenue of $1.1 billion was down $16 million, or 1%, driven by a reduction of $191 million in MSR risk management revenue and a $48 million wr ite-down on auto loans transferred to held- for-sale. Higher prime mortgage production revenue provided a favorable offset. The provision for credit losses was $378 million, up $139 million, or 58%, from the prior year. Excluding the special provision for Hurricane Katr ina, the provision for credit losses was $128 million, down $111 million, or 46%. Results reflected lower net charge-offs, continued good credit quality trends across all business segments and the benefit of certain portfolios in run-off. Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, down $82 m illion, or 4%, from the prior year. The reduction reflected increased operati ng efficiencies in nearly all bus inesses, partially offset by JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 ongoing investments in retail banki ng distribution and sales and increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Home Finance operating earnings were $235 m illion, down $105 million from the prior year. Excluding the special provision for credit losses associated with Hurricane Katrina, operating earnings would have been $322 million, down $18 million from the prior year. Operating earnings for the Prime Production & Servicing segment totaled $67 million, down $36 million. The decline in perfor mance was the result of MSR risk management losses of $38 million, a decreas e of $191 million. Earnings benefited from higher production-related revenue attributable to in creased margins and volume and lower expenses. Improvement during th e quarter reflected a better mix of loan production from more profitable origination cha nnels and reduced cost to originate. Mortgage servicing revenue was $161 m illion, up $27 million, benefiting from a 5% increase in third-party loans serviced. Operating earnings for the Consumer Re al Estate Lending segment totaled $168 million, down $69 million. Excluding the special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina, operating earni ngs totaled $255 million, up $18 million. Improvement reflected increased loan balan ces and the absence of prior-year write- downs attributable to subprime mortgage lo ans held-for-sale. These benefits were offset by narrower spreads on the home eq uity loan portfolio, largely due to accelerated loan payoffs. Other Highlights Include:  Mortgage loan originations of $39. 3 billion were up 15% from the prior year and up 27% from the prior quarter.  Home equity loan originations of $ 14.3 billion were up 3% from the prior year and down 9% from the prior quarter.  Third-party mortgage loans servi ced of $450 billion increased by $23.0 billion, or 5%.  Average mortgage loans retained of $47.6 billion increased by 8%; period- end mortgage loans were $46.7 billion.  Average home equity loans retain ed of $71.8 billion increased by 8%; period-end home equity loans were $74.3 billion.  Nonperforming assets of $846 million declined $151 million, or 15%.  Net charge-off rate was 0.13%, down from 0.23%. Consumer & Small Business operating earnings were $356 million, down $21 million from the prior year. Excluding the special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina, operating earni ngs would have been $412 million, up $35 million. Net revenue was essentially unchange d from the prior year. Higher deposit balances and increased debit and credit card fees were offset by declines in deposit spreads and service charges and by lower inve stment sales revenue related to a shift in the product sales mix. Earnings benefite d from a lower provision and a decline in expenses as a result of merger efficiencies , despite continued investment in retail banking distribution and sales. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Other Highlights Include:  Successfully completed Texas syst ems conversion, moving 400 branches and 850 ATMs to common operating systems.  Checking accounts grew by 216,000, to 8.8 million during the quarter.

Auto & Education Finance operating earnings were $47 million, down $38 million from the prior year. Excluding the special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina, operating earnings would have been $59 million, down $26 million. This decline in performance refl ected a net loss of $43 million, associated with the transfer of $1.5 billi on of auto loans to held-for -sale as well as lower loan and lease-related assets. Favorable credit trends and lower credit costs continued to provide an offset to reduced operating reve nue. Excluding the impact of increased depreciation expense on owned automobile s subject to operating leases, expenses declined as the cost structure was aligned with reduced production volumes. Other Highlights Include:  Average loan receivables were $45.9 billion, down $7.0 billion, or 13%, from the prior year, and down $3.9 billion, or 8%, from the prior quarter.  Average lease-related assets were $6.2 billion, down $700 million, or 10%, from the prior quarter.  The net charge-off rate dropped to 0.56% from 0.64%. Insurance operating earnings were $18 million, dow n $2 million from the prior year, on net revenue of $158 million. The decl ine was primarily due to increased proprietary annuity sales commissions, par tially offset by increased net interest spread earned on proprietary annuity activity.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings of $541 million were up $120 million, or 29%, from the prior year. Results reflected a special provision for credit losses of $100 million attributable to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the impact of the special provision, oper ating earnings would have been $603 million, up $182 million, or 43%. Results benefited from higher revenue and lower expenses. Lower expenses were driven by merger savings, incl uding lower compensation and processing costs. Partially offsetting these benefits was a higher provision for cred it losses related to increased bankruptcies. Net revenue was $4.0 billion, up $209 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $53 million, or 2%, due to highe r loan balances, partially offset by an increase in loan balances in their introductory rate period. Noninteres t revenue of $1.0 billion was up $156 million, or 18%. This increase was dr iven by higher charge volume resulting in increased interchange income, partially offset by higher volume-driven payments to partners and by rewards expense. The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, up $171 million, or 10%. This increase was driven by three factors. First, there were high er bankruptcy-related net charge-offs, which were partially offset by lower contractual net char ge-offs. Second, the provision was increased by $100 million, related to significantly higher bankrupt cy filings due to the pending change in legislation. The final factor was the special provision for credit losses of $100 million, related to Hurricane Katrina. Despite a record level of bankruptcy losses, the net charge-off rate improved, and the delinquency rate continued to be low. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter declined to 4.70%, down from 4.88% in the prior year and 4.87% in the pr ior quarter. The 30- day managed delinquency rate wa s 3.39%, down from 3.81% in the pr ior year but up seasonally from 3.34% in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense of $1.3 billion decreased by $151 million, or 11%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower processing and compensation cost s. Both of these reductions were primarily related to merger savings, reduced vendor cost, the TSYS conversion and headcount reductions. Other Highlights Include:  Successfully completed the conversion to the TSYS processing system.  Merger savings of $650 million remain on track.  Pre-tax income to average managed loans (ROO) was 2.48%; excluding the special charge related to Hurricane Katrina, ROO would have been 2.77%.  Entered into an agreement to purchase the Sears Canada Inc. credit card operation, including the private-labe l and co-branded Sears MasterCard® portfolios.  Announced agreement with First Data Corporation to integrate Chase Merchant Services and Paymentech merchant processing businesses. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings were $301 million, up $86 milli on, or 40%, from the prior year. Results reflected a special provision for credit losses of $35 million, attributable to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the impact of the special provision, earnings would have been $323 million, up $108 million, or 50%. This increase was due to a lowe r provision for credit losses, growth in revenue and a decline in expenses. Net revenue was $909 million, up $76 million, or 9%, fr om the prior year. Net interest income was $654 million, up $46 million, or 8%, due to higher spreads and volume related to liability balances and increased loan balances, partially offset by lower loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $255 million, up $30 million, or 13%, prim arily reflecting growth in investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower service charges on deposits. Each business within Commercial Banking showed re venue growth over the prior year. Middle Market revenue was $592 million, an increase of $41 million, or 7%, driven by increased liability spreads and higher liability and loan balances. Corporate Banking revenue of $140 million increased by $31 million, or 28%, due to growth in investment banking revenue and wider spreads on higher liability balances. Real Estate revenue was $143 million, up $20 million, or 16%, primarily reflecting increased liability balances and wider spreads. Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $46 million, an improvement from both the prior year and prior quarter of $60 million and $188 million, respectively. Excluding the special provision of $35 million related to Hurricane Katr ina, the provision for credit losses would have been a net benefit of $81 million, compared with a provision of $14 million in the prior year and $142 million in the prior quarter. The positive vari ance from the prior peri ods was the result of improved underlying credit quality, particularly in Middle Market. In addition, continued management of the portfolio led to a decl ine in nonperforming loan s of $210 million, or 36%, from the prior year and $65 million, or 15%, from the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 8 Noninterest expense was $461 million, down $19 milli on, or 4%, from the prior year, primarily due to lower compensation costs. Partially offs etting this benefit were increased unit costs for Treasury Services products. Other Highlights Include:  Average loan balances of $51.8 billion were up $1.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior year, driven by 7% growth in Middle Market and 5% growth in Corporate Banking. Real Estate loans declined 10% from the prior year, due to continued competitive market conditions.  Revenue from Treasury Services produc ts was $582 million, an increase of $83 million, or 17%, from the prior year, driven by wider spreads and higher liability balances across all businesses.  Overhead ratio of 51% declined from 58% in the prior year and 53% in the prior quarter.

Noninterest revenue was $1.0 billion, up $125 million, or 14%. The improvement was due to an increase in assets under custody to $11.0 tril lion, primarily driven by mark et value appreciation and new business; the acquisition of Vastera, and grow th in foreign exchange, securities lending and wholesale card revenues, driven primarily by br oader product usage by existing customers. Partially offsetting this growth in noninterest revenue were lowe r service charges on deposits. Net interest income was $510 million, up $92 milli on from the prior year, primarily resulting from wider spreads on liability balances and an in crease of 22% in average liability balances, to $167 billion.

TSS is charged with a credit reimbursement related to certain exposures managed within the Investment Bank credit portfolio on behalf of clients shared with TSS. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 9 Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, down $49 milli on from the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to a significant software-impairment charge of $85 million in the prior year, lower allocations of Corporate segment expenses an d increased product unit costs charged to other lines of business, primarily Commercial Banking . Partially offsetting these decreases was higher compensation expense, primarily related to new business growth and the Vastera acquisition. Other Highlights Include:  Pre-tax margin (2) was 26%, up from 10% in the prior year.  Average liability balances were $167 billion, an increase of 22%.  Assets under custody incr eased to $11.0 tril lion, up 24% (excluding assets under custody added from Institutional Trust Services in 2005).  Corporate Trust Securities under administration were $6.7 trillion, an increase of 2%.  U.S. dollar ACH transactions originated increased 16%, and U.S. dollar clearing volumes increased 14%.  Wholesale cards issued increased 14%, to 12.8 million.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings were a record $315 million, up $118 million, or 60%, from the prior year. Performance was driven by increased revenues, partially offset by higher compensation expense. Net revenue was $1.4 billion, up $256 million, or 21%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $1.2 billion was up $258 million, or 28%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of a majority interest in Highbr idge Capital Management in th e fourth quarter of 2004 and net asset inflows, mainly in equity-related and liqui dity products. Also contributing to the increase were global equity market appreciation and incr eased brokerage activity. Net interest income was $267 million, essentially unchanged from the pr ior year, as higher deposit and loan balances and wider loan spreads were offset by lower deposit spreads. Private Bank client segment revenue grew 10% from the prior year, to $421 million, and Retail client segment revenue grew 42%, to $415 million. Institutional client segment revenue grew 34%, to $358 million, primarily due to the consolid ation impact of Highbr idge. Private Client Services client segment revenue grew 2%, to $255 million.

Net revenue was negative $391 million, compared with negative $58 million in the prior year. Net interest income was negative $645 millio n, compared with negative $536 million. The decline was driven primarily by repositioning of the treasury portfolio in prior periods. Noninterest revenue of $254 million declined by $224 million, primarily due to the absence of a one-time gain on the sale of an investment, a nd treasury portfolio losses of $43 million versus gains of $109 million in the prior year. This was partially offset by private equity gains of $313 million, an increase of $78 million from the prior year. Noninterest expense was $382 m illion, down $124 million, or 25%, from the prior year. The expense decline was primarily due to lower compensation, merger-related savings and other efficiencies. Other Highlights Include:  Private Equity portfolio was $5.9 billion, down from $8.1 billion in the prior year and $6.4 billion in the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings were $2.7 billion, up $505 million, or 23%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses. During the third quarter, a special provision for credit losses of $400 million was taken to cover probable credit losses due to Hurricane Katrina. This provision is related to expected credit losses for businesses and individuals who are locat ed in the affected areas of the Gulf Coast region. The special provision was established based upon management’s current estimate of probable loss and may be updated as the quality of data and full access to the impacted areas improve. In developing the estimate of probabl e credit losses, management considered factors such as the areas most severely affected, level and type of insurance coverage, collateral and lien position, direct communication with customers, financial condition of the borrower, environmental impact and other factors. Net revenue was $15.6 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 15%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $8.9 billion was up $2.1 billion, or 31%, primarily due to record trading revenues of $2.4 billion. Noninterest revenue al so benefited from higher asset management, administration and commissions revenues, and increased credit card revenue. Partially offsetting this growth were securities losses on the treasury portfolio compared with gains in the prior year and lower deposit-related fees. Net interest income wa s $6.6 billion, down $149 million, or 2%, primarily due to narrower spreads on consumer and wholesal e loans and the reduced level of the treasury portfolio. These declines were partially offset by higher consumer and wholesale loan balances. The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion, up $348 million from the prior year. The increase was due to a $400 million special provision related to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding the impact of the special provision, wholesale prov ision for credit losses was a benefit of $149 million for the quarter, compared with a benef it of $137 million in the prior year, reflecting continued strength in credit quality. The wholes ale loan net recovery rate was 0.12% for the quarter, a slight improvement comp ared with a net recovery rate of 0.08% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the special provision related to Hurricane Katrina, total consumer JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 managed provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, slightly lower than the prior year, reflecting lower net charge-offs and positive seasonal deli nquency trends in Retail Financial Services. Partially offsetting the reduction was a higher provi sion in Card Services, primarily related to accelerated bankruptcy filings due to the pendi ng change in bankruptcy legislation. The managed net charge-off rate for Card Services declined to 4.70% from 4.88%. Retail Financial Services net charge-off rate was 0.31%, co mpared with 0.47%. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.8 billion at Sept ember 30, 2005, down $798 million, or 22%, from the prior-year level of $3.6 billion. Noninterest expense was $9.2 billion, up $618 milli on, or 7%, from the prior year, driven primarily by higher performance-based incentive compensation. Salary and benefit expenses also increased, reflecting acquisitions and bus iness growth. Noncompensation expenses decreased in most categories, reflecting merge r-related savings, other efficiencies and lower software-impairment charges. Other Corporate Items  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.2% at September 30, 2005 (estimated), 8.2% at June 30, 2005, and 8.6% at September 30, 2004.  During the quarter, $500 million of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 14.4 million shares at an aver age price of $34.61 per share. As of September 30, 2005, a total of $3.1 billion, or 86.5 million shares, have been repurchased under the $6.0 billion share repurchase program.  Headcount of 168,955 increased by 247 since June 30, 2005, primarily due to business growth. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Merger and other financial information • Merger savings and cost: For the quarter ended September 30, 2005, approximately $500 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualized rate of $2.0 billion. Management continues to estimate annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion. Approximately two-thirds of the savings are anticipated to be realized by the end of 2005. Merger cost of $221 million was expensed during the third quarter of 2005, bringing the total amount expensed year-to-date to $645 million and $2.0 billion cumulative since the merger announcement. Management continues to estimate remaining merger costs of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, which are expected to be expensed over the next two years. • Common stock repurchase program: The firm has determined that it may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of its common stock in accordance w ith the $6.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors on July 20, 2004. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan would allow the firm to repurchase its shares during its internal trading black out periods when it would normally not be repurchasing its common stock. There is no assurance that the firm will, in fact, en ter into any Rule 10b5-1 program in respect of any "black out period." Irrespective of entering into any Rule 10b5-1 program, the firm intends to continue to purchase shares, without further announcement, pursuant to its authorized repurchase program. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business results on an operating basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results. In the case of the Investment Bank, noninterest revenue on an operating basis includes in trading revenue net interest income related to trading activities. Trading activities generate revenues, which are recorded for U.S. GAAP purposes in two line items on the income statement: trading revenue, which includes the mark-to-market gains or losses on trading positions; and net interest income, which includes the interest income or expense related to those positions. Combining both the trading revenue and related net interest income enables management to evaluate the Investment Bank’s trading activities, by considering a ll revenue related to these activities, and facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. In the cas e of Card Services, operating, or managed, basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performan ce of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the credit card for ongoing ch arges, a borrower’s credit performance will impact both the loan receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Commencing with the first quarter of 2005, operating revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segmen ts and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investme nts that receive tax credits are presented in the operating results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. The Corporate sector’s and the firm’s operating revenue and income tax expense for the periods prior to the first quarter of 2005 have been restated to be similarly presented on a tax-equivalent basis. The restatement had no impact on the Corporate sector’s or the firm’s operating results. Finally, operating basis excludes the non-operating litigation charges taken in the second and first quarters of 2005 and second quarter of 2004, merger costs and costs related to the conformance of certain accounting policies as a result of the merger, as management believes these items are not part of the firm’s normal daily business operations and, therefore, not indicative of trends, nor do they provide meaningful comparisons with other periods. See page 7 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third quarter 2005) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to operating basis. 2. Pre-tax margin represents operating earnings before in come taxes divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre-tax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates TSS’ and AWM’s performance and that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
