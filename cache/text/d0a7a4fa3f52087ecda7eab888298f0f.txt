Results were driven by the merger, increased investment banking fees, and an increased benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher compensation expense. Compared to the prior quarter, operating earnings doubled, primarily due to higher trading revenues. Revenues of $4.2 billion were up $4 16 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year . Investment banking fees of $9 85 million in creased $2 95 million , or 4 3%, compared to the prior year , reflecting continued strong levels of debt underwriting , advisory and equity underwriting fees and the merger .

Fixed Income Markets revenues of $2.3 bil lion were up 9% from the prior year , primarily driven by the merger, and up 50% from the prior quarter on strength in trading revenues in credit and interest rate markets. Equity Markets revenues of $55 6 million were down 1 2% from the prior year reflecting reduced trading results , but increased significantly from the prior quarter .

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $36 6 million compared to a benefit of $188 million in the prior year. The increased benefit was primarily attributable to a greater re duction in the allowance for credit losses, reflecting improvement in credit quality as a result of the turnover in the loan portfolio mix toward higher rated clients and net recoveries. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Expenses of $2.5 billion were up $199 million, or 9%, from the prior year, due to the merger and increased compensation costs.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $36 6 million, compared to a $303 million benefit last year. The increased benefit was primarily attributable to a greater re duction of allowance , reflecting credit quality improvement as a result of turnover in the loan portfolio mix toward higher rated clients and net recoveries. Expenses of $2.5 billion were up $97 million, or 4%, compared to last year due to an increase in performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by reduced noncompensation expenses.

Discussion of Historical Results: Operating earnings were $988 million, up $782 million from the prior year. The increase was largely due to the merger, but also reflected improved risk management results in Home Finance , wider spreads on deposits, increased deposit balances, and lower expenses due to merger -related savings in all businesses. These improvements were partially offset by a reduction in revenue related to lower prime mortgage originations. Total net revenue increased to $3.8 billion, up $2.2 billion from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.7 billion increased $1.5 billion as a result of the merger, as well as from wider spreads on deposits, increased deposit balances, growth in retained home equity loan s, and the absence of a $40 million ch arge taken in the first quarter of 2004 related to auto lease residuals . These benefits were partially offset by the absence of the $4 billion manufactured home loan portfolio that was sold in late 2004. Noninterest revenue of $1.2 billion increased $728 million due to the merger, improved Home Finance risk management results and a gain of $24 million on the sale of a recreational vehicle loan portfolio. These increases were offset partially by lower revenue related to a drop in prime mortgage originations and an $88 million write-down on $2.7 billion of auto loans transferred to held-for-sale. The provision for credit losses totaled $94 million , up $40 million from last year. The increase was largely due to the merger. Both the prior year and current quarter included reductions in the allowance for loan losses due to improved credit trends in most consumer lending portfolios. Results also included the benefit of reductions in the allowance for loan losses totaling $20 million related to the sale of th e recreational vehicle loan portfolio and the transfer of auto loans to held -for-sale. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in provision expense related to the decision to retain subprime mortgage loans rather than securitize. Expenses ro se to $2.2 billion , an increase of $9 21 million , primarily due to the merger . Results also included continued investment in the retail banking distribution system and a $40 million charge related to the dissolution of a student loan joint venture in the E ducation Finance segment. These increases were more than offset by merger-related savings in all businesses. Home Finance operating earnings were $4 42 million, up $221 million compared to the prior year. Operating earnings for the Prime Production & Se rvicing segment of $158 million were up $9 3 million from the prior year . Results benefited from an increase in risk management revenue associated with the MSR asset and secondary marketing activities, as well as lower expenses. These were partially offse t by a decrease in revenue due to lower prime mortgage originations. Earnings for the Consumer Real Estate Lending segment of $284 million were up $128 million from the prior year . Growth was largely due to the merger , but also reflected higher retained home equity loan balances and merger-related expense savings. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the $4 billion manufactured home loan portfolio that was sold in late 2004. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Consumer & Small Business operating earnings totaled $4 77 million, up $526 million from the prior year. While growth was largely due to the merger , the results also benefited from wider spreads on deposits , increased deposit balances and merger -related expenses savings . These benefits were partially offset by co ntinued investment in the distribution network. Compared to the prior quarter, operating earnings increased $ 47 million, or 11%, primarily due to the seasonal impact of tax-refund anticipation lending. Auto & Education Finance operating earnings of $55 million were up $25 million from last year. The current quarter results included a $78 million loss associated with auto loans transferred to held -for-sale, a $40 million joint venture dissolution charge and a benefit of $34 million from the sale of a $2 billion recreational vehicle loan portfolio. The prior year results included a $40 million charge related to auto lease residuals. Excluding the after-tax impact of these four items, operating earnings would have increased $5 1 million, primarily due to the merger and improved credit quality. Results continued to reflect lower production volumes and narrower margins, due to the competitive nature of the operating environment. Insurance operating earnings totaled $14 million on net revenues of $173 million. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to the merger. Discussion of Proforma Combined Results: Operating earnings of $988 million were up $244 million, or 33%, from the prior year. Prior year results included $53 million of operating e arnings related to sales and the write-down of the heritage Bank One brokered home equity loans deemed non -core. Excluding this non -core income, operating earnings of $988 million were up $ 297 million, or 43% , from the prior year. Performance reflected m erger-related expense savings, wider spreads on deposit products and improved mortgage risk management results. The following description of RFS performance excludes the impact of the prior year’s non -core actions related to heritage Bank One brokered home equity loans, which added $53 million to operating earnings, to illustrate the underlying business trends. Net revenues of $3.8 billion were up $167 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Net interest income was up slightly at $2.7 billion, reflecting wider spreads on deposit products , increased deposit balances, higher retained home equity loan s, and the absence of a $40 million charge taken in the first quarter of 2004 related to auto lease residuals. Partially offsetting these gains were reduced mortgage warehouse balances and the absence of the $4 billion manufactured home loan portfolio that was sold in late 2004. Noninterest revenue of $1.2 billion was $ 139 million, or 13% higher than the prior year, driven by higher mortgage risk management re venue and a gain of $24 million on the sale of a recreational vehicle loan portfolio. Partially offsetting these benefits were a reduction in revenue related to lower prime mortgage originations and an $88 million write-down on $2.7 billion of auto loans transferred to held-for-sale. The provision for credit losses totaled $94 million, down $103 million, or 52%, from the prior year, largely due to continued good credit quality trends across all business segments, which drove a reduction in the allowance f or loan losses. Results also included the benefit of lower provision expense for portfolios in run -off, as well as reductions in the allowance for loan losses totaling $20 million related to the sale of the recreational vehicle loan portfolio and the auto loans transferred to held -for-sale. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in provision expense related to the decision to retain subprime mortgage loans rather than securitize.

Partially offsetting these improvements were lower service charges on deposits. Treasury Services net revenue grew to $618 million, Inves tor Services to $508 million and Institutional Trust Services to $356 million. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other lines of business, grew to $2.1 billion, up $84 1 million or 67% , primarily as a result of the merger. TS firmwide net revenue grew to $1.2 billion, up $63 2 million, or 104%, primarily as a result of the merger.

News Release 11 Noninterest expense of $1.1 billion was up $198 million , or 23% , due to the merger, increas ed compensation and technology -related expenses. Offsetting these increases were lower allocations of Corporate segment expense s and higher product unit costs charged to other lines of business, primarily Commercial Banking. Discussion of Proforma Combined Results: Operating earnings for the quarter were $245 million, an increase of $152 million , reflecting improved net revenue and slightly lower expenses. TSS net revenue of $1.5 billion improved by $202 million, or 16%. Net interest income of $496 million was up $147 million, or 42%, resulting from wider spreads on liability balances, which include deposits and deposits swept into on-balance sheet liabilities, and an increase of 26% in average liability balances to $155 billion. Noninterest revenue of $986 million grew $55 million , or 6%, driven largely by an increase in assets under custody to $ 10.2 trillion. Beginning March 31, 2005, assets under custody include an estimated $400 billion of Institutional Trust Services’ assets under custody. Exc luding this amount, assets under custody increased $1.6 trillion, or 20%, attributable to new business, increased volumes and market value appreciation. Also contributing to noninterest revenue improvement was growth in commercial card products, securities lending, trade and trust products, including CDO administration. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower service charges on deposits. Treasury Services net revenue grew to $618 million, Investor Services grew to $508 million and Institutional Trust Services grew to $356 million. TSS firmwide net revenue, which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other lines of business, grew to $2.1 billion, up $256 million, or 14%.

Total revenues were $14. 7 billion, u p $5. 2 billion, or 5 5%, primarily due to the merger . Noninterest revenues were $ 8.1 billion, up $1. 8 billion or 2 8%, from the prior year , primarily due to the merger . Additional contributing factors were higher private equity gains , higher investment banking fees, and increased levels of mortgage related revenue , which benefited from improved risk management results. These were partially offset by losses f rom repositioning the Treasury investment portfolio , and lower trading revenues compared to strong prior year results . Net interes t income was $6. 7 billion, up $3.4 billion from the prior year , primarily due to the merger. Also contributing to the increa se were higher consumer loan and deposit balances and the acquisition of a private label portfolio in Card Services, and wider deposit spreads on consumer and wholesale balances. The prov ision for credit losses was $1. 3 billion, an increase of $85 6 million, due to the merger. Total wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $ 386 million for the quarter, compared to a benefit of $ 272 million in the prior year. The wholesale loan net recovery rate was 0.03% for the quarter, compared to a net charge-off rate of 0.50% in the prior year. Credit quality in the consumer portfolio s reflected reduced bankruptcy filings and favorable delinquency trends. The managed net charge -off rate for Card Services declined to 4.83% from 5.81% in the prior year. Retail Financial Services net charge-off rate increased to 0.34% compared to 0.32% in the prior year , primarily due to the merger. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.9 billion at March 31, 2005, up 2% from the prior year. Expenses, which exclude the litigation charge discussed below, were $8.9 billion, up $2.8 billion, or 46%, from the prior year. Compensation exp enses of $4.7 billion drove $1.4 billion of the increase, related primarily to the merger and to higher performance -related incentive compensation. N on-compensation expenses of $4.2 billion increased $1.4 billion primarily due to the merger. The firm took a $900 million ($558 million after -tax) litigation charge in connection with its settlement of the WorldCom class action litigation. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 Discussion of Proforma Combined Results: Operating earnings were $2.9 billion, down $115 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower revenue of $516 million, partially offset by lower expenses of $220 million and a lower provision for credit losses of $133 million. Total revenues were $14.7 billion, down $516 million, or 3%. Noninterest revenues were $8.1 billion, down 5% from the prior year, primarily due to securities losses resulting from the reposition ing of the Treasury investment portfolio. Trading revenues were down slightly from very strong prior year results and lending and deposit related fees were lower. Partially offsetting these results were higher private equity gains and higher investment banking fees due to strength in advisory, debt and equity underwriting. Additionally, fees and commissions were up due to product growth and the acquisition of Highbridge , and mortgage related revenue was up driven by improved risk management results. Net int erest income was $6.7 billion, down $12 2 million, or 2%, primarily due to the reduced level of the Treasury investment portfolio, lower wholesale loan balances and tighter wholesale loan spreads, partially offset by higher consumer loan and deposit balances and spread widening on consumer and wholesale deposits. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, down $133 million, or 9%. Total wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $38 6 million for the quarter, compared to a benefit of $463 million in the prior year. The wholesale loan net recovery rate was 0.03% for the quarter, compared to a net charge -off rate of 0.25% in the prior year. Total consumer managed provision for credit losses decreased to $1.7 billion, down 11%, reflecting l ower net charge-offs, lower bankruptcies, and positive delinquency trends. The managed net charge-off rate for Card Services declined to 4.83% from 5.49% in the prior year. Retail Financial Services net charge-off rate was 0.34%, compared to 0.56% in the prior year. The improvement compared to the prior year reflected the run -off of higher risk, non -strategic portfolios. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.9 billion at March 31, 2005, down 39% from the prior year’s level of $4.9 billion. Operating expenses, which exclude the litigation charge discussed below, were $8.9 billion, down $220 million, or 2% , from the prior year , driven primarily by merger -related savings in non -compensation expense. This was partially offset by higher levels of compe nsation expense which increased to $4.7 billion, up $135 million, or 3%, resulting from increased performance -based incentives and the acquisition of Highbridge. Non -compensation expense of $4.2 billion decreased $355 million, or 8%, primarily due to reduced levels of outside services and occupancy expense. The firm took a $900 million ($558 million after -tax) litigation charge in connection with its settlement of the WorldCom class action litigation. Other Corporate Items • Tier 1 capital ratio was 8. 6% at March 31, 2005 (estimated), 8.7% at December 31, 2004 and 8.8% at March 31, 2004. • During the quarter , $1.3 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 36.0 million shares at an average price of $36.57 per share. • Headcount of approximately 164,000 was up 3,400 since December 31, 2004, primarily due to technology insourcing and acquisitions. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 16 Merger and other financial information • Merger between JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corporation: On July 1, 2004, JPMorgan Chase and Bank One complete d the merger of their holding companies. The merger was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the earnings for JPMorgan Chase and Bank One are combined for all periods since completion of the merger; all time periods prior to the merger date are on a reported basis, JPMorgan Chase only. • Merger saves and costs: Management continues to estimate annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion. Approximately two-thirds of the savings are anticipated to be realized by the end of 2005. During the first quarter of 2005, approximately $380 million of merger savings were realized , which is a n annualized run rate of $1.5 billion. Management currently estimates one -time merger costs of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion. Of this amount, approximately $1.0 billion has been accounted for as purchase accounting adjustments and recorded as goodwill . Merger costs of approximately $1.4 billion were incurred during 2004 and $145 million in the first quarter of 2005 and were recorded as non -operating ex pense. The remaining merger costs are expected to be incurred over the next two years. • Conformance of accounting policies: As part of the merger, certain accounting policies and practices were conformed, resulting in charges to income during the third an d fourth quarters of 2004 of $976 million (pre-tax). The conformance of accounting policy that had the largest impact is related to the decertification of the seller’s retained interest in credit card securitizations. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 17 Notes: 1. Operating earnings, which i s a non -GAAP financial measure, excludes the after -tax impact of litigation charges taken in the first quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2004, merger costs, and the conformance of accounting policies and practices . M anagement believes these items are not part of the firm’s normal daily business operations and, therefore, not indicative of trends. See page 7 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (First Quarter 2005) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from reported to operating. 2. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the firm’s and the lines of business results on an operating basis, which is a non -GAAP financial measure. The definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results. In the case of the Investment Bank, operating basis includes in trading revenue net interest income related to trading activities. Trading activities generate revenues that are recorded for GAAP purposes in two line items on the income statement: trading revenue, which includes the mark-to-market gains or losses on trading positions; and net interest income, which includes the interest income or expense related to those positions. Combining both the trading revenue and related net interest income enables management to evaluate the Investment Bank’s trading activities, by considering all revenue related to these activities, and facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. In the case of Card Services, oper ating or managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold; as the same borrower is continuing to use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will impact both the receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosu res regarding managed receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. In addition, f or the firm and its businesses, t otal operating revenue ( noninterest revenue and net interest income) are presented on a tax -equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax -exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the operating results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. In the 1st quarter of 2005, the Corporate sector and the firm’s results have been restated to be presented on a tax -equivalent basis. Previously, only the segments’ operating results were presented on a tax -equivalent basis and the impact of the segment's tax -equivalent adjustments were eliminated in the Corporate sector. This restatement has no impact on the Corporate sector's or the firm's operating earnings. Also, operating basis excludes the litigation reserve charges taken in the first quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2004, merger costs and charges for the conformance of certain accounting policies as the results of the merger , as management believes these items are not part of the firm’s normal daily business operations and, therefore, not indicative of trends, and also do not provide meaningful comparisons with other periods. See page 7 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (F irst Quarter 200 5) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from reported to operating basis. 3. Following the merger with Bank One, JPMorgan Chase reorganized its business segments. The Investment Bank now includes portions of Bank One’s Commercial Bank; Global Treasury has been transferred to the Corporate segment. Retail Financial Services is comprised of Chase Financial Services, excluding Card Services and Middle Market and includes Bank One’s Retail line of business and insurance activities. Card Services is the combination of Chase Card Services and Bank One Card Services. The Commercial Banking segment is comprised of Chase Middle Market, and the Middle Market portion of Bank One’s Commercial Bank. Treasury & Securities Services added Bank One’s Global Treasury Services (formerly in Commercial Bank). Asset & Wealth Management is JPMorgan Chase’s Investment Management & Private Bank plus Bank One’s Investment Management Group (excluding insurance activity). The Corporate segment is Bank One’s Corporate line of business excluding discontinued loan and lease portfolios (now in Retail Financial Services), plus JPMorgan Partners and Global Treasury. 4. Market share data is from Thomson Financial and is proforma for the merger of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One. 5. Pre-tax margin represents operating earnings before income taxes divided by total net revenue, which is a comprehensive measure of pre -tax performance and is another basis by which management evaluates TSS and AWM’s performance versus competitors. Pre -tax margin is an effective measure of TSS and AWM’s earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 18 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
