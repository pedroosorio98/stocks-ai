(NYSE: JPM) today reported second -quarter 2011 net income of $5.4 billion, compared with net income of $4.8 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Earnings per share were $1.27, compared with $1.09 in the second quarter of 2010. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Our second -quarter earnings reflected solid performance across most of our businesses. The Investment Bank delivered strong earnings across most products and maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees. Commercial Banking reported record revenue and continued loan growth for the quarter. Retail Financial Services demonstrated good underlying performance in Retail Banking but continued to experience high losses for mortgage-related issues.” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Dimon continued: “We are pleased to report that our results for the quarter reflected continued improvement in credit trends across our consumer and wholesale portfolios. With respect to our credit card portfolio, delinquencies and net charge -offs improved, and we reduced loan loss reserves by $1.0 billion as estimated loss es declined. We expect credit card net charge -offs to continue to improve next quarter as we approach a more normalized credit environment. Within our wholesale credit portfolio, credit trends appear to have normalized.” “With respect to our mortgage portfolio, delinquency and net charge-off trends improved modestly compared with the prior quarter; however, net charge -offs remained high, and we expect credit losses to remain elevated. We have been working hard to fix our problems and address past mistakes. We have already incurred significant costs, charged -off substantial amounts and established significant reserves for mortgage -related issues. Unfortunately, it will take some time to resolve these issues and it is possible we will incur additional costs a long the way. However, in time, these costs will normalize as well.” Commenting on the Firm’s balance sheet, Dimon said: “We maintained our fortress balance sheet, ending the second quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.1%. Our strong and grow ing capital base enabled us to buy back $3.5 billion of stock during the second quarter, and we will continue to buy back stock opportunistically. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio was approximately 7. 6% at the end of the second quarter. T his level is well in excess of what is required today under existing rules and is greater than the level we expect will be required under the proposed rules for up to five years, including the additional buffer for global systemically important financial institutions. Our strong capital position and significant earnings power will allow us to actively grow our business and rapidly meet any proposed Basel III requirements as they are phased in. We intend to keep our capital ratios approximately where they ar e as we do not see a need to manage to higher ratios ahead of time.” Dimon also remarked: “ Through the recession, w e have helped hospitals, school systems, banks, state governments, countries and central banks, and we will continue to do so. During the fir st six months of 2011, JPMorgan Chase provided credit to and raised capital of over $990 billion for our clients. We originated mortgages to more than 360,000 people; we provided credit cards to approximately 4.6 million people; we lent or increased credit to more than 16,800 small businesses; we lent to more than 800 not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities; we extended or increased loan limits to approximately 3,000 middle-market companies; and w e lent to or raised capital for more than 5,000 other corporations. We are the #1 Small Business Administration lender in the U.S. , with more loans made than any other lender. In 2009 and 2010, we lent more than $7 billion and $10 billion, respectively, to small businesses, and we have committed to lend at least $12 billion more this year. We remain committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures. Since the beginning of 2009, we have offered 1,177,000 trial modifications to struggling homeowners.” Dimon concluded: “Looking forward, we continue to see substantial opportunities for the company. We are building our international presence, with more bankers, branches and products to serve our multinational clients where they want to be served. In the U.S., we are also investing in new branches and adding bankers and salespeople, expanding the reach of our consumer and wholesale businesses.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Net revenue was $ 7.3 billion, compared with $6.3 billion in the prior year. Investment banking fees were up 37% to $1.9 billion, consisting of debt underwriting fees of $866 million (up 24%), equity underwriting fees of $455 million ( up 29%), and advisory fees of $601 million ( up 69%). Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $5.5 billion, compared with $4.6 billion in the prior year, reflecting solid client re venue. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $111 million, primarily reflecting the negative net impact of credit -related valuation adjustments, largely offset by net interest income and fees on retained loans. The provision for credit losses was a benef it of $ 183 million, compared with a benefit of $325 million in the prior year. The current-quarter benefit primarily reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely due to net repayments. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.10%, compared with 3.98% in the prior year, driven by the improved quality of the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs were $7 million, compared with net charge- offs of $28 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $ 4.3 billion, down 4% from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower compensation expense. The prior-year results included the impact of the U.K. bonus tax.

Net revenue was $8.0 billion, an increase of $167 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $4. 6 billion, down by $246 million, or 5%, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by an increase in deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $3.4 billion, up by $413 million, or 14%, driven by higher mortgage fees and related income, debit card income, deposit-related fees and investment sales revenue. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $587 million from the prior year and $198 million from the prior quarter. While delinquency trends and net charge -offs have modestly improved compared with both prior periods, the current -quarter provision continued to refl ect elevated losses in the mortgage and home equity portfolios.

The allowance for loan losses to end- of-period loans retained, excluding purchased credit-impaired loans, was 4.90%, compared with 5.26% in the prior year and 4.84% in the prior quarter.

Retail Banking reported net income of $1.1 billion, an increase of $188 million, or 21% , compared with the prior year. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, up 5% from the prior year. Net interest income was $2.7 billion, flat to the prior year, as the impact from higher deposit balances was offset predominantly by the effect of lower deposit spread s. Noninterest revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by higher debit card revenue, deposit-related fees and investment sales revenue. The provision for credit losses was $42 million, compared with $168 million in the prior year. N et charge-offs were $1 17 million (2. 74% net charge -off rate), compared with $168 million (4.04% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.

The improvement was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. Net revenue was $1.2 billion, down by $148 million, or 11%, from t he prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income as a result of lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by wider loan spreads. The provision for credit losses was $954 million, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $418 million reduction in net charge -offs, driven by a modest improvement in delinquency trends. (For further detail, see the RFS discussion of the provision for credit losses, above.)

The improved results were driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. End-of-period loans were $125.5 billion, a decrease of $17.5 billion, or 12 %, from the prior year and a decrease of $3.3 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. Average loans were $125.0 billion, a decrease of $21.3 billion, or 15%, from the prior year and a decrease of $7.5 billion, or 6%, from the prior quarter. The declines in both end- of-period and averag e loans were consistent with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 expectations. The end-of-period and average loan totals also reflected the impact of the Firm’s sale of the $3.7 billion Kohl’s portfolio on April 1, 2011. Net revenue was $ 3.9 billion, a decrease of $ 290 million, or 7%, fro m the prior year. Net interest income was $2.9 billion, down by $445 million, or 13%. The decrease in net interest income was driven by lower average loan balances (including the impact of the Kohl’s portfolio sale) , the impact of legislative changes and a decreased level of fees. These decreases were largely offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower charge- offs. Noninterest revenue was $1.0 billion, an increase of $155 million, or 18%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by lower partner revenue-sharing due to the impact of the Kohl’s portfolio sale, higher net interchange income and the transfer of the Commercial Card business to CS from Treasury & Securities Services in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest revenue increased 9%. The provision for credit losses was $810 million, compared with $ 2.2 billion in the prior year and $226 million in the prior quarter. The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a reduction of $1.0 billion to the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses. The prior-year provision included a reduction of $1.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses. T he net charge-off rate 1 was 5.81%, down from 10.20% in the prior year and 6.81% in the prior quarter; the 30+ day delinquency rate 1 was 2.98%, down from 4.96% in the prior year and 3.55% in the prior quarter.

Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 13%, from the prior year, due to higher marketing expense and the inclusion of the Commercial Card business. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest expense increased 8%.

World wide Securities Services net revenue was $1.0 billion, an increase of $47 million, or 5%. The increase was driven by higher market levels, higher net interest income and net inflows of assets under custody . Treasury Services net revenue was $930 million, relatively flat compared with the prior year, as higher trade loan volumes and higher deposit balances were largely offset by the transfer of Commercial Card business to Card Services in the first quarter of 2011 and lower spreads on deposits. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, TS net revenue increased 7%. TSS generated firmwide net revenue 2 of $2.6 billion, including $1.6 billion by Treasury Services; of that amount, $930 million was recorded in Treasury Services, $556 million in Commerc ial Banking and $65 million in other lines of business. The remaining $1.0 billion of firmwide net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities Services. Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $54 million, or 4%, from the prior year.

Assets under supervision were $1.9 trillion, an increase of $284 billion, or 17%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $ 1.3 trillion, an increase of $181 billion, or 16% . Both increases were due to the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to long-term products, partially offset by net outflows from liquidity products. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $ 582 billion, up by $103 billion, or 22%, due to the effect of higher mark et levels and custody and brokerage inflows. The provision for credit losses was $12 million, compared with $5 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, an increase of $389 million, or 28 %, from the prior year, largely resulting from an increase in headcount and higher performance-based compensation. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Pretax margin2 was 29%, down from 32%.  Assets under management reflected net in flows of $3 billion for the quarter; net inflows were $57 billion for the 1 2 months ended June 30, 2011. For the quarter, net inflows of $19 billion to long-term products were predominantly offset by net outflows of $16 billion from liquidity products.  Assets u nder management ranked in the top two quartiles for investment performance were 76% over 5 years, 71% over 3 years and 56% over 1 year.  Customer assets in 4 and 5 Star –rated funds were 50% of all rated mutual fund assets.  Average loans were $48.8 billion, up 31% from the prior year and 9% from the prior quarter. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 11  End-of-period loans were $51.7 billion, up 34% from the prior year and 11% from the prior quarter.  Average deposits were $ 97.5 billion, up 13% from the prior year and 2 % from the prior quarter.

See notes on page 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $26,779 million, $25,221 million, and $25,101 million for the second quarter of 2011, first quarter of 2011, and second quarter of 2010, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5. 4 billion, up by $636 million, or 13%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue and a significantly lower provision for credit losses, largely offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $27.4 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 7%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $15.5 billion, up by $2.6 billion, or 20%, from the prior year; the increase was driven by higher levels of principal transactions revenue, investment banking fees and asset management, administration and commissions revenue. Lower securities gains in Corporate partially offset the J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 increased revenue. Net interest income was $ 12.0 billion, down by $826 million, or 6%, driven predominantly by lower loan balances. The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, down by $1.6 billion, or 46%, from the prior year. The total consumer pr ovision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, compared with $3.9 billion in the prior year. The decrease in the provision reflected improved delinquency trends across most consumer portfolios. Consumer net charge -offs 1 were $3.0 billion, compared with $5.5 billion in the prior year, result ing in net charge -off rates of 3.25% and 5.34%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $117 million, compared with a benefit of $572 million in the prior year , reflecting continued improvement in the credit environment. The current-quarter benefit reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, primarily due to net repayments. Wholesale net charge-offs were $80 million in the current quarter, compared with $231 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge -off rates of 0.14% and 0.44%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained1 was 3.83%, compared with 5.34% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $13.2 billion at June 30, 2011, down from the prior-year level of $18.2 billion and from the prior-quarter level of $15.0 billion. Noninterest expense was $ 16.8 billion, up 15% from the prior year, driven by higher noncompensation expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio1 was 10.1% at June 30, 2011, compared with 10.0% at March 31, 2011, and 9.6% at June 30, 2010.  Headcount was 250,095, an increase of 17,156, or 7%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzi ng the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully tax equivalent (“ FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non -GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end -of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge -off rates exclude th e impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased credit -impaired portfolio totaled $4.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2011, March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2010, respectively. c. The Basel I Tier 1 common ra tio is Tier 1 common divided by risk -weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity , such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferr ed capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non -GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. T he Firm uses Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III”. The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non- GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted. The Firm’s estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of further rule -making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firm’s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firm’s capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. d. In Card Services, supplemental information is provided for Chase, excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios , to provide more meaningful measure s that enable comparability with prior periods . The net charge-off rate and 30+ delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount -related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance- based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in management’s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
