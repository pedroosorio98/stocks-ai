With this refined time series, the average Total VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 would have been lower by $(5) million, $(5) million, $(4) million and $(1) million, respectively. Refer to Commercial & Investment Bank VaR on page 19 for further information. (b) Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that require management judgment. The Firm’s actual net interest income for the rate shifts presented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are modelled as instantaneous shifts and exclude any actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Other significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk scenarios may also differ from actual results, including mortgage prepayments and deposits rates paid. Refer to pages 147-148 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for additional information. (c) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, represents the total of the Firm’s U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities as presented in Structural interest rate risk management of the Firm’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the respective periods.

(b) Effective April 1, 2025, the Firm refined the historical proxy time series inputs to one of its VaR models to more appropriately reflect the risk exposure from certain securitization warehousing loan positions. With this refined time series, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been lower by the following amounts: CIB trading VaR by fixed income risk type of $(7) million, $(6) million, $(6) million, and $(2) million, CIB trading VaR of $(6) million, $(5) million, $(4) million and $(1) million and CIB VaR of $(5) million, $(6) million, $(5) million and $(1) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. (c) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 143–145 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K and pages 65–67 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025 for further information. (d) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across CIB risks. (e) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. Page 19 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures (a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. (b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. (d) In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”), net yield, and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, as shown below. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income.These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K.
