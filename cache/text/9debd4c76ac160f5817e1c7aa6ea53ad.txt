On November 22, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (&#8220;Broadcom&#8221;) completed its acquisition of VMware, Inc. (&#8220;VMware&#8221;) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), dated as of May 26, 2022, by and among Broadcom, VMware, Verona Holdco, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of VMware (&#8220;Holdco&#8221;), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (&#8220;Merger Sub 1&#8221;), Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (&#8220;Merger Sub 2&#8221;), and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (&#8220;Merger Sub 3&#8221;). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub 1 merged with and into VMware (the &#8220;First Merger&#8221;), with VMware continuing as the surviving corporation in the First Merger (the &#8220;Surviving Company&#8221;) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco; (ii) following the First Merger, the Surviving Company was converted from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company (the &#8220;Conversion&#8221;); (iii) following the Conversion, Merger Sub 2 merged with and into Holdco (the &#8220;Second Merger&#8221;), with Holdco continuing as the surviving corporation in the Second Merger (the &#8220;Holdco Surviving Company&#8221;) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom; and (iv) following the Second Merger, the Holdco Surviving Company merged with and into Merger Sub 3, with Merger Sub 3 continuing as the surviving limited liability company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom (the &#8220;Third Merger&#8221; and together with the First Merger, the Conversion and the Second Merger, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). Each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of VMware (each, a &#8220;VMware Common Share&#8221;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;), other than VMware Common Shares owned or held in treasury by VMware or owned by Merger Sub 2 or in the treasury of the Surviving Company (which were cancelled), any VMware Common Shares owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of VMware, and any VMware Common Shares held by stockholders who properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such VMware Common Share , and subject to proration in accordance with the Merger Agreement as described below, one of the following forms of consideration (the &#8220;Merger Consideration&#8221;): &#8226; $142.50 in cash, without interest (the &#8220;Cash Consideration&#8221;) per VMware Common Share; or &#8226; 0.25200 of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Broadcom (each, a &#8220;Broadcom Common Share&#8221;) per VMware Common Share (the &#8220;Stock Consideration&#8221;). The Merger Consideration was subject to proration, such that the total number of VMware Common Shares entitled to receive the Cash Consideration and the total number of VMware Common Shares entitled to receive the Stock Consideration were, in each case, equal to 50% of the aggregate number of VMware Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No fractional Broadcom Common Shares were issued. The results of the Merger Consideration elections were reported in a press release issued by Broadcom and VMware on October 30, 2023. As of the Effective Time, each VMware restricted stock unit award held by a non-employee member of the VMware Board of Directors and each in-the-money VMware stock option vested and was converted into the right to receive, in respect of each underlying share (or in the case of a stock option, each net option share, as calculated pursuant to the Merger Agreement), an amount equal to 50% of the Cash Consideration and a number of Broadcom Common Shares equal to 50% of the Stock Consideration, without interest and less applicable tax withholding. Each outstanding VMware restricted stock unit award not held by a non-employee member of the VMware Board of Directors and each outstanding VMware performance-based restricted stock unit award was converted into a Broadcom restricted stock unit award based on an equity award exchange ratio calculated as the sum of (i) 50% of the Stock Consideration and (ii) 50% of the Cash Consideration divided by the volume weighted average sale price of a Broadcom Common Share over the ten consecutive trading days ending on the second to last trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. With respect to performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the level of achievement of the applicable performance goals was determined at the Effective Time in the manner described in the Merger Agreement. &#160; 2 Broadcom funded the Cash Consideration through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement referred to below.
