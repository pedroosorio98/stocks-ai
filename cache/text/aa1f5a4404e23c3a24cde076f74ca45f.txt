The activity rate also reached a new high of 84% . In Brazil, the customer base increased by 18% YoY to 98.8 million, accounting for 56% of the country&#8217;s adult population, with 60% of monthly active customers designating Nu as their primary banking account (PBA). Mexico also experienced strong growth, with 1.2 million net-adds over the quarter, bringing the total to 8.9 million customers and underscoring the effectiveness of Nu's strategy to enhance deposit yields in the country, which has accelerated growth and strengthened its position as Mexico&#8217;s leading digital financial platform. Additionally, Colombia reached a significant milestone of 2.0 million customers, sustaining the positive momentum from the launch of the Nu Cuenta product. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Compounding Growth Showcasing Robust Cohort Performance Nota 1: &#8216; LTM&#8217; is the last twelve months for the period ended September 30, 2024 .

The loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) was 40% , versus 39% in the previous quarter. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; Strong Performance for Both Credit Card and Lending Portfolios, with Lending Gaining More Relevance Over Time Note 1: Amounts are presented in US dollars and growth rates on an FX Neutral basis. For additional detail on calculations please refer to the appendix Non-IFRS Financial measures and reconciliations. Note 2: All amounts are presented gross of provisions. Source: Nu. &nbsp; Total credit card and lending gross receivables increased 47% YoY FXN, reaching $20.9 billion in Q3'24 while the Interest Earning Portfolio (&#8220;IEP&#8221;) rose 81% YoY FXN, to $11.2 billion . Growth was mainly driven by sustained growth in credit card receivables, which were up 33% YoY FXN to $15.2 billion, and in lending, which increased 97% YoY FXN to $5.7 billion. &nbsp; Nu's interest-earning installments remained steady at 28% of total credit card portfolio, aligning with expectations shared last quarter. While demand for PIX Financing products remains strong, Nu has intentionally slowed the pace of eligibility expansion to more closely monitor performance over the coming quarters. If the portfolio continues to perform well, Nu may resume growth in the near term. The focus is on gathering additional data to ensure credit models remain resilient. The demand for this product is very clear, and Nu is strategically managing supply to safeguard credit quality and maintain portfolio resilience. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sustained Revenue Growth Fueled by Customer Acquisition and ARPAC Expansion Note 1: Amounts are presented in US dollars and growth rates on an FX Neutral basis. For additional detail on calculations please refer to the appendix Non-IFRS Financial measures and reconciliations. Note 2: &#8216;Average revenue per active customer&#8217; or &#8216;ARPAC&#8217; is defined as the average monthly revenue (total revenue divided by the number of months in the period) divided by the average number of individual active customers during the period (average number of individual active customers is defined as the average of the number of monthly active customers at the beginning of the period measured, and the number of monthly active customers at the end of the period). Source: Nu. &nbsp; ARPAC increased 25% YoY FXN to $11.0 in Q3'24, while revenues reached a new record high of $2.9 billion, up 56% YoY FXN. The dynamics of ARPAC in this slide are affected by the acceleration of Nu's customer base in Mexico and, more recently, in Colombia. While deposits strategy in these new geos may attract customers who initially engage with the Cuenta product only, a product that generates relatively low ARPAC levels, Nu is very confident in the long-term results that this growth strategy is expected to yield for the Company, as seen in Brazil for almost a decade now. &nbsp; Decreasing Cost to Serve Underscores Operating Leverage Potential&#8203; Note 1: Amounts are presented in US dollars and growth rates on an FX Neutral basis. For additional detail on calculations please refer to the appendix Non-IFRS Financial measures and reconciliations. Note 2 : &#8216;Cost to serve&#8217; is defined as the monthly average of the sum of transactional expenses, customer support and operations expenses (sum of these expenses in the period divided by the number of months in the period) divided by the average number of individual active customers during the period (average number of individual active customers is defined as the average of the number of monthly active customers at the beginning of the period measured, and the number of monthly active customers at the end of the period). Note 3 : Q3&#8217;24 one-off adjustment was related to cloud service provider retroactive fixed FX correction relocated from Customer Service to G&amp;A. Source : Nu. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer was $0.7 in Q3'24, or $0.8 adjusted by one-offs explained next, remaining below the $1 level. On an FX-neutral basis, this represents a 2% year-over-year increase when adjusted for one-offs in Q3'24, mostly related to FX impacts on data and cloud costs that had been allocated under customer services and now were reallocated to G&amp;A, as FX variations are unrelated to customer services and align better with general administrative expenses. During the same period, Nu&#8217;s ARPAC grew by 25%, highlighting the strong operating leverage of Nu&#8217;s business model. &nbsp; Delinquency Ratios Tracking Expectations&#8203; Note 1 : Includes both credit card and lending excluding SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises). Note 2: &#8216;NPL&#8217; is a non-performing loan. Note 3 : In Q2&#8217;22, we reviewed and changed our write-off methodology for recovery of the contractual cash-flows of NPLs arising from unsecured lending from 360+ days to 120+ days. Figures consider this change. Our write-off methodology for credit cards remained unchanged at 360+ days. Note 4: Information presented for Brazil only. Source: Nu, BCB. &nbsp; Non-Performing Loans The decline of Nu's leading indicator, the NPL 15-90 observed during the second quarter of 2024, continued into this quarter, with NPLs decreasing by 10 basis points to 4.4% 4 . Meanwhile, the 90+ NPL ratio increased 20bp sequentially to 7.2% 4 , aligned with expectations. Recall that 90+ behaves as a stock rather than flow metric, in the sense that this quarter's 90+ houses inventory that was in 15-90 from one quarter ago all the way to three quarters ago. Thus to understand the movement in 90+ from last quarter to this quarter it's important to trace it back to the change in 15-90 from four quarters ago all the way to last quarter. &nbsp; 4: Data for Brazil only. &nbsp; &nbsp; Comfortable Capital and Liquidity Positions Note 1: Brazil figures consider the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) requirement of 8.75%, applicable to the conglomerate led by Nu Pagamentos S.A. as of September 2024, according to BCB Resolution No. 200/22. Mexico's figures consider the NICAP required for a SOFIPO type 4, equivalent to a Capital Adequacy ratio of 10.5%; Colombia's figures consider a minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio of 10.5%, applicable to Nu Financiera, as a regulated entity.

This growth was mainly driven by two factors: (i) sustained high interest income from the consumer finance portfolio, generated from the ongoing expansion of credit cards and lending; and (ii) the credit mix, mainly related to the increase in installments with interest within the credit card portfolio.&nbsp;Fee and Commission Income in Q3'24 increased 32% YoY FXN to $469.4 million . This growth was mainly driven by the following increases: (i) interchange fees, supported by increased purchase volumes on credit and prepaid cards, reflecting ongoing growth of Nu's customer base and activity rates; and (ii) late fees also due to the overall growth of Nu's credit portfolio. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided increased 48% YoY FXN to $1,594.6 million . In Q3&#8217;24, this cost accounted for 54% of revenues in the quarter, versus 57% in Q3'23, reflecting the following dynamics: &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided ($ million) Q3'24 Q3'23 Interest and Other Financial Expenses (761.0) (537.6) Transactional Expenses (59.5) (56.8) Credit Loss Allowance Expenses (774.1) (627.5) Total (1,594.6) (1,221.9) % of Revenue 54% 57% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest and Other Financial Expenses (761.0) (473.6) Transactional Expenses (59.5) (50.0) Credit Loss Allowance Expenses (774.1) (552.6) Total (1,594.6) (1,076.2) % of Revenue 54% 57% &nbsp; Interest and Other Financial Expenses increased as a result of: (i) higher interest expenses on retail deposits reflecting the expansion of Nu&#8217;s retail deposits balance, which reached $28.3 billion this quarter; and (ii) higher interest expenses over debt instruments and financing due the issuance of financial letters, repurchase agreements and interest related to new borrowings particularly derived from the expansion of operations in Mexico and Colombia. &nbsp; Finally, similar to prior quarters, Credit Loss Allowance Expenses increased primarily driven by the growth of the credit portfolio, as Nu Holdings frontloads provisions based on the expected losses for the life of the credit in accordance with the IFRS 9 methodology. &nbsp; Gross Profit &nbsp; Gross Profit reached $1,348.6 million, up 67% YoY FXN while gross profit margin achieved 46% from 43% in Q3'23. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OPERATING EXPENSES &nbsp; Operating Expenses amounted to $624.8 million in Q3'24, increasing 41% YoY FXN, but declining three percentage points as a percentage of revenues, from 24% in Q3'23 to 21% this quarter. &nbsp; Operating Expenses ($ million) Q3'24 Q3'23 Customer Support and Operations (135.2) (127.3) General and Administrative Expenses (284.7) (264.3) Marketing Expenses (99.8) (46.5) Other expenses (105.1) (65.2) Total (624.8) (503.3) % of Revenue 21% 24% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; Customer Support and Operations (135.2) (112.1) General and Administrative Expenses (284.7) (232.8) Marketing Expenses (99.8) (41.0) Other Income (Expenses) (105.1) (57.4) Total (624.8) (443.3) % of Revenue 21% 24% &nbsp; The absolute YoY growth in Operating Expenses was mainly driven by the following increases: (i) Marketing Expenses, which rose 143% FXN as Nu made investments to further solidify and build brand trust. Additionally, there were US$40 million in marketing expenses recorded in September, 2024, aimed at repositioning Nucoins within a new loyalty program developed for Nubank's customers; (ii) General and Administrative Expenses, which increased 22% FXN due to rising infrastructure and data processing costs, and higher salaries and associated benefits linked to the Company&#8217;s overall growth as well as US$8 million one-off expenses attributed to the impairment of certain capitalized intangible assets associated with the discontinuation of the liquidity pool feature for Nucoins 5 ; and (iii) Other Income (Expenses) as a result of higher federal taxes due the increase of interest income. &nbsp; 5: The post-tax effects associated with the repositioning of Nucoins amounted to US$28.5 million as of Q3'24. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net Interest Income Expansion Driven by Growth of Interest Earning Portfolio Note 1: &#8216;NII&#8217; stands for Net Interest Income and is calculated as Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments minus Interest and other financial expenses.

Note 3: Amounts are presented in US dollars and growth rates on an FX Neutral basis. For additional detail on calculations please refer to the appendix Non-IFRS Financial measures and reconciliations. Source: Nu. &nbsp; Net interest income, or NII, increased by 63% YoY FXN, reaching US$1.7 billion . Growth was driven by sustained expansion of Nu's credit card and lending portfolios, collectively boosting NII and net interest margin (NIM) on an annual basis. The slowdown in growth QoQ was mainly driven by the combination of three factors: (i) yields on the credit card portfolio declined reflecting an improved customer and product risk profile; (ii) lending yields declined as secured loans continue to grow; and (iii) funding costs in Mexico and Colombia continue pressured, in line with Nu&#8217;s yield strategy to quickly ramp-up deposit growth in new geos. &nbsp; Risk-Adjusted NIM Performance Demonstrates Effective Pricing for Marginal Risk Note 1: &#8216;CLA&#8217; stands for Credit Loss Allowance Expenses.

This increase was aligned with the growth pace of Nu&#8217;s credit portfolio and early delinquency performance. &nbsp; Risk-Adjusted NIM reached 10.1% and decreased 90 bp in the quarter, as a result of the 140 bp decrease in NIM, which was partially offset by a 50 bp improvement in cost of risk. On a year-on-year basis, Risk-Adjusted NIM increased 110 bp, underscoring Nu&#8217;s focus on optimizing the lifetime value of customer relationship cohorts. &nbsp; Strong Track Record of Driving Operating Leverage as Business Scales Note 1: &#8216;NII&#8217; stands for Net Interest Income and is calculated as Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments minus Interest and other financial expenses.

In addition to IFRS financials, this release includes certain summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial information. These summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. References in this release to &#8220;R$&#8221; refer to the Brazilian Real, the official currency of Brazil. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This release includes financial measures defined as &#8220;non-IFRS financial measures&#8221; by the SEC, including: Adjusted Net Income and certain FX Neutral measures and provides reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure. A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance or financial position that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure. These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income is defined as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company for the period, adjusted for the expenses and allocated tax effects on share-based compensation. &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income is presented because management believes that this non-IFRS financial measure can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of the operating and financial performance of the Company, although it is not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. Nu also uses Adjusted Net Income as a key profitability measure to assess the performance of the business. Nu believes Adjusted Net Income is useful to evaluate operating and financial performance for the following reasons: &nbsp; &#9679; &#8203;Adjusted Net Income is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company&#8217;s operating &#9679; performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period, depending on their accounting and tax methods, the book value and the market value of their assets and liabilities, and the method by which their assets were acquired; and &#9679; Non-cash equity grants made to executives, employees or consultants at a certain price and point in time, and their hedge accounting effects for the corporate tax and social wages and their income tax effects, do not necessarily reflect how the business is performing at any particular time and the related expenses (and their subject impacts in the market value of assets and liabilities) are not key measures of core operating performance. &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income is not a substitute for Net Income, which is the IFRS measure of earnings. Additionally, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including competitors in the technology and financial services industries, because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner as we do, and therefore, measure may not be comparable to those of other companies.&#8203; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19 &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (In millions of U.S. Dollars) &nbsp; Nu Holdings (Consolidated) As reported For the three months ended September 30, Adjusted Net Income (US$ million) 2024 2023 Profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company 553.4 303.0 Share-based compensation 87.2 71.2 Allocated tax effects on share-based compensation (30.4) (20.5) Hedge of the tax effects on share-based compensation (18.0) 1.9 Adjusted Net Income for the period/year 592.2 355.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; FX Neutral measures are prepared and presented to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange, or &#8220;FX,&#8221; volatility between the comparison periods, allowing management and investors to evaluate financial performance despite variations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may not be indicative of core operating results and business outlook. FX Neutral measures are presented because management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of operating and financial performance, although they are not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. The FX Neutral measures were calculated to present what such measures in preceding periods would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these preceding periods until the date of the Company's most recent financial information. The FX Neutral measures for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts of Adjusted Net Income and the key business metrics for such period by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (R$4.9050 to US$1.00) and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (R$5.5693 to US$1.00), so as to present what certain of statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained stable from this past period until the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated as the average of the month-end rates for each month in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as reported by Bloomberg. FX Neutral measures for deposits and interest-earning portfolio were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts as of each date, by the spot Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates as of each date and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by using the spot rate as of September 30, 2024 (R$5.4500 to US$1.00) so as to present what these amounts would have been had exchange rates been the same on September 30, 2023. The Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated using rates as of such dates as reported by Bloomberg. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20 &nbsp; FX Rates - On a monthly basis, Nu translates its subsidiaries figures from their individual functional currency into Nu Holdings functional currency, the U.S. Dollars (&quot;US$&quot;), following the requirements of IAS 21 &quot;The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates&quot;.
