In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. There are no reclassifications associated with FR managed revenue 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K 3. First-quarter 2024 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding the $725mm increase to the estimated FDIC special assessment are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding this item resulted in an increase of $550mm (after tax) to reported net income from $13.4B to $14.0B; an increase of $0.19 per share to reported EPS from $4.44 to $4.63; and an increase of 1% to ROTCE from 21% to 22%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results 4. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. ROTCE ex. FR uses the same average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $106.81, $104.45 and $94.34 at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 5. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense of ($72mm), $175mm and $176mm for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. There was no legal expense excluded from FR adjusted expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 10 Additional notes 1. Reflects the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") capital transition provisions. As of March 31, 2024, CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the final remaining $720mm CECL benefit; as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, CET1 capital reflected a $1.4B benefit. Refer to Note 27 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable securities, includes end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR. Also includes other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102-109 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information 3. The 1Q23 prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation, which uses end-of-period HQLA and end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities. Previous presentations used average Firm HQLA (consistent with the LCR metric) and end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities 11 Additional notes on slides 4-6 Slide 4 – Consumer & Community Banking 2.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation 4. Includes gross revenues earned by the Firm that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement between CB and the CIB for Investment Banking and Markets’ products sold to CB clients. This includes revenues related to fixed income and equity markets products. Refer to page 65 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for discussion of revenue sharing 5. Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate and loan loss coverage ratio 6. The FR impact to the net charge-off rate is negative due to the addition of FR loans to the overall denominator 7.
