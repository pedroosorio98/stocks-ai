Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported strong results in the third quarter of 2019, with net income of $9.1 billion, or $2.68 per share, on record net revenue of $29.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 18%. • The Firm had net income of $9.1 billion, up 8%. • Total net revenue increased 8%. Net interest income was $14.2 billion, up 2%, driven by continued balance sheet growth and mix, largely offset by the impact of rates. Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up 13%, and included approximately $350 million of gains related to certain loan sales in Home Lending. Excluding these gains, the increase in noninterest revenue was largely driven by results in Fixed Income Markets in the CIB, as well as Home Lending and Auto in CCB. • Noninterest expense was $16.4 billion, up 5%, driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expenses and investments, including compensation and auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. • The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, up $566 million, largely as a result of net reductions in the allowance for credit losses and net recoveries in the prior year. • The total allowance for credit losses was $14.4 billion at September 30, 2019, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.42%, compared with 1.39% in the prior year; excluding the PCI portfolio, the equivalent ratio was 1.32%, compared with 1.23% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $5.3 billion at September 30, 2019, an increase from $5.0 billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the wholesale portfolio related to select client downgrades, largely offset by improved credit performance in the consumer portfolio. • Firmwide average total loans were flat at $947 billion, or up 3% excluding the impact of certain loan sales in Home Lending. Selected capital-related metrics • The Firm’s CET1 capital was $188 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.3% and 13.1%, respectively. • The Firm’s supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) was 6.3% at September 30, 2019. • The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending the third quarter of 2019 at $60.48, up 9%. ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 19–20 for a further discussion of each of these measures. 7 Business segment highlights Selected business metrics for each of the Firm’s four lines of business are presented below for the third quarter of 2019. CCB ROE 32% • Average loans down 4%; Home Lending loans down 12% impacted by loan sales; credit card loans up 8% • Client investment assets up 13%; average deposits up 3% • Credit card sales volume up 10% and merchant processing volume up 11% CIB ROE 13% • Maintained #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with 9.3% wallet share YTD • Total Markets revenue of $5.1 billion, up 14% CB ROE 16% • Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million, up 20% • Average client deposits of $173 billion, up 3% AWM ROE 24% • Average loan balances up 7% • Assets under management (AUM) of $2.2 trillion, up 8% Refer to the Business Segment Results on pages 21–43 for a detailed discussion of results by business segment.

Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 79 of this Form 10-Q and Risk Factors on pages 7–28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in the full year of 2019 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of 2019 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects that it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. Firmwide • Management expects full-year 2019 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be less than $57.5 billion, market dependent. This estimate is based on stable long-end rates and assumes no more federal funds rate cuts in 2019. • Management expects Firmwide adjusted expense for the full-year 2019 to be approximately $65.5 billion. • Management expects full-year 2019 net charge-offs to be approximately $5.5 billion. 9 Business Developments Expected departure of the U.K. from the EU The U.K.’s expected departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” is scheduled to occur not later than January 31, 2020. The Firm continues to execute the relevant elements of its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program with the objective of delivering the Firm’s capabilities to its EU clients on “day one” of any departure by the U.K. from the EU, whether or not an agreement has been reached to allow an orderly withdrawal. The principal operational risks associated with Brexit continue to be the potential for disruption caused by insufficient preparations by individual market participants or in the overall market ecosystem, and risks related to potential disruptions of connectivity among market participants. Although legislative and regulatory actions taken by the EU and the U.K. have mitigated some of the significant market-wide risks, there continues to be regulatory and legal uncertainty with respect to various matters including contract continuity and access by market participants to liquidity in certain products, such as products subject to potentially conflicting U.K. and EU regulatory requirements in relation to eligible trading venues, including certain cross-border derivative contracts and equities that are listed on both U.K. and EU exchanges. As discussed in Business Developments on page 46 of the 2018 Form 10-K, the Firm is focused on the following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and operational readiness. Following are the significant updates from the matters discussed in the 2018 Form 10-K. Regulatory and legal entity readiness The Firm’s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are now prepared and licensed to provide services to the Firm’s EU clients, including after any departure by the U.K. from the EU. Client readiness The agreements covering a significant proportion of the Firm’s EU client activity have been re-documented to other EU legal entities to help facilitate continuation of service. The Firm continues to actively engage with clients that have not completed re-documentation to ensure preparedness both in terms of documentation and any operational changes that may be required. The Firm may be negatively impacted by any operational disruption stemming from delays of or lapses in the readiness of other market participants or market infrastructures. Business and operational readiness The Firm relocated certain employees during the first quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Firm added specific employees to certain EU legal entities, where appropriate, to support the level of client activity that has been migrated. However, the Firm’s final staffing plan will depend upon the timing and terms of any withdrawal by the U.K. from the EU. If Brexit is further delayed due to a transition deal or another mechanism, the Firm will continue to review the timing and extent of any further expansion of activities in its EU legal entities, as appropriate. The Firm continues to closely monitor legislative developments, and its implementation plan allows for flexibility given the continued uncertainties. LIBOR transition The Firm continues to develop and implement plans to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of certain unsecured benchmark interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”). In particular, the Firm: • has implemented or is in the process of implementing fallback language for LIBOR-linked syndicated loans, securitizations, floating rate notes and bi-lateral business loans based on the recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, and has started to introduce the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a replacement benchmark rate for certain of these products; • continues to monitor the transition relief being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) concerning the accounting for contract modifications and hedge accounting; and • continues to engage with regulators and clients as the transition from IBORs progresses. Refer to Business Developments on page 47 of the 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected discontinuation of LIBOR and other IBORs. 10 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, unless otherwise specified.

Quarterly results Investment banking fees increased reflecting: • higher debt underwriting fees, on wallet share gains despite a decline in industry-wide fees, driven by participation in large acquisition financing deals and increased activity in investment-grade bonds • higher equity underwriting fees driven by wallet share gains primarily in the IPO and convertible markets, partially offset by • lower advisory fees driven by a decline in industry-wide fees compared with a strong prior year. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 28–33 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting: • higher revenue in CIB, primarily driven by – strong performance across products in Fixed Income Markets, primarily in Rates, agency mortgage trading within Securitized Products, and Commodities, compared with the prior year, which was impacted by less favorable market conditions, partially offset by – lower revenue in Equity Markets, primarily in derivatives, driven by lower client activity and less favorable market conditions, compared with a strong prior year, and • in Corporate, net gains on certain legacy private equity investments compared with net losses in the prior year. Principal transactions revenue in CIB may have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis. Refer to CIB, AWM and Corporate segment results on pages 28–33, pages 38–41 and pages 42–43, and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily due to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in customer accounts and transactions. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22–27, CIB on pages 28–33 and CB on pages 34–37, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased driven by higher asset management fees in CCB from growth in client investment assets. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 22–27 and pages 38–41 , respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Investment securities gains/(losses) primarily reflect the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42–43 and Note 9 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income increased driven by: • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting approximately $350 million of gains on the sale of certain loans, as well as higher production volumes and margins • net mortgage servicing revenue, which remained relatively flat, reflecting lower operating revenue driven by the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for- sale and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates, offset by favorable MSR risk management results. 11 Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22–27, Note 5 and 14 for further information. Card income decreased reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, predominantly offset by higher interchange income and merchant processing fees on higher volumes. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22–27 and Note 5 for further information. Other income increased reflecting: • higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB • losses in the prior year on certain investments in CIB and Corporate, partially offset by • lower other income in CIB associated with increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments. The increased amortization was more than offset by the lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits. Refer to Note 5 for further information. Net interest income increased driven by continued balance sheet growth and changes in mix, largely offset by the net impact of rates. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.4 trillion, up $162 billion, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.41%, a decrease of 12 basis points. The net interest yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.23%, a decrease of 7 basis points. Net interest yield excluding CIB markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on pages 166–167 for further details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 19–20 for a further discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB markets. Year-to-date results Investment banking fees were relatively flat reflecting: • lower advisory and equity underwriting fees driven by a decline in industry-wide fees despite wallet share gains, offset by • higher debt underwriting fees on wallet share gains despite a decline in industry-wide fees, driven by participation in large acquisition financing deals Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting: • higher revenue in CIB, which included a gain on the IPO of Tradeweb. Excluding this gain, the increase in CIB’s revenue was driven by: – higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, primarily in agency mortgage trading within Securitized Products, and Commodities, partially offset by Currencies & Emerging Markets – favorable changes in funding spreads on derivatives in Credit Adjustments & Other, partially offset by – lower revenue in Equity Markets driven by lower client activity in derivatives the net increase in CIB was partially offset by • lower revenue in AWM, related to hedges on certain investments, which was more than offset by higher valuation gains on the related investments reflected in other income, • Corporate was relatively flat, reflecting – losses on cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions, and – lower net valuation losses on certain legacy private equity investments. Principal transactions revenue in CIB may have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily due to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in customer accounts and transactions. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue was relatively flat reflecting: • lower asset management fees in AWM driven by a shift in the mix toward lower fee products, largely offset by • higher asset management fees in CCB from growth in client investment assets. Investment securities gains/(losses) primarily reflect the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income increased driven by: • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting gains on sales of certain loans, as well as higher mortgage production margins and volumes, partially offset by • lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by – lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale, as well as – lower MSR risk management results reflecting updates to model inputs. Card income increased reflecting the absence of the prior- year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. Other income increased reflecting: • higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB, and • higher investment valuation gains in AWM, which were largely offset by the impact of the related hedges reflected in principal transactions revenue, partially offset by 12 • lower other income in CIB associated with increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments. The increased amortization was more than offset by the lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits. The prior year included: • $505 million of fair value gains related to the adoption of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost in the first quarter of 2018, and • losses on certain investments in CIB and Corporate. Net interest income increased driven by continued balance sheet growth and changes in mix. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.3 trillion, up $136 billion, and the net interest yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.49%, a decrease of 1 basis point. The net interest yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.34%, an increase of 13 basis points. Net interest yield excluding CIB markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Special-purpose entities The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees. The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct. The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. In addition, refer to Note 1 for information about the Firm’s consolidation policies. Type of off-balance sheet arrangement Location of disclosure Page references Special-purpose entities: variable interests and other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from variable interests in nonconsolidated VIEs Refer to Note 13 139-144 Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments Refer to Note 22 156-159 19 EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 80–84. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures include: • Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis) • Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets businesses • Certain credit metrics and ratios, which exclude PCI loans • Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS. In addition, core loans is a key performance measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio.

(c) In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments from interest-earning to noninterest-earning assets, as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 19–20 for a definition of managed basis. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. Refer to Line of business equity on page 47 for further information about line of business capital. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the assumptions and methodologies used in capital allocation are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to lines of business may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on business segment capital allocation. Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.

(a) Included operating lease depreciation expense of $1.0 billion and $862 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Included MSR risk management results of $53 million and $(88) million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $(200) million and $(94) million for nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 23 Quarterly results Net income was $4.3 billion, an increase of 5%. Net revenue was $14.3 billion, an increase of 7%. Net production revenue included approximately $350 million of gains on the sale of certain mortgage loans that were predominantly offset by a charge in net interest income for the unwind of the related internal funding from Treasury and Chief Investment Office (“CIO”) associated with these loans. The charge reflects the net present value of that funding and is recognized as interest income in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate on pages 42–43 of this Form 10-Q and Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) on page 60 of the Firm’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information. Net interest income was $9.2 billion, up 1% and includes the charge from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding this charge, net interest income increased, driven by: • higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, as well as growth in deposit balances and higher deposit margins in CBB, partially offset by • lower loan balances due to loan sales, as well as loan spread compression in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was $5.1 billion, up 22% and includes the gain from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding this gain, noninterest revenue increased, driven by: • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production volumes and margins, and • higher auto lease volume • net mortgage servicing revenue, which remained relatively flat, reflecting lower operating revenue driven by the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for- sale and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates, offset by favorable MSR risk management results. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Noninterest expense was $7.3 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by: • technology, marketing and other investments in the business, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by • expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, an increase of 34%, reflecting: • an increase in credit card due to – higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with expectations, and – a $200 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting higher loss rates, as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, compared to a $150 million addition in the prior year • an increase in consumer, excluding credit card due to – a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and – lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from a larger recovery on a loan sale partially offset by – a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the business banking portfolio. 24 Year-to-date results Net income was $12.4 billion, an increase of 15%. Net revenue was $41.8 billion, an increase of 9%. Net production revenue included gains on sales of certain mortgage loans that were predominantly offset by charges in net interest income for the unwind of the related internal funding from Treasury and CIO associated with these loans. Net interest income was $28.0 billion, up 6%, and includes charges from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding these charges, net interest income increased, driven by: • higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances in CBB, as well as higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, partially offset by • lower loan balances due to loan sales, as well as loan spread compression in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was $13.9 billion, up 15%, and includes gains from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding these gains, noninterest revenue increased, driven by: • higher auto lease volume, • higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production margins and volumes, and • the impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability, partially offset by • lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by – lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale, as well as – lower MSR risk management results reflecting updates to model inputs. Noninterest expense was $21.7 billion, up 4%, driven by: • technology, marketing and other investments in the business, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by • expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $3.7 billion, an increase of 10%, reflecting: • an increase in credit card due to – a $400 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting higher loss rates, as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio and loan growth, compared to a $150 million addition in the prior year, and – higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with expectations partially offset by • a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to – a $400 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and – a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the business banking portfolio largely offset by – lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales. 25 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except headcount) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Total assets $ 532,487 $ 560,432 (5)% $ 532,487 $ 560,432 (5)% Loans: Consumer & Business Banking 26,699 26,451 1 26,699 26,451 1 Home equity 31,552 37,461 (16) 31,552 37,461 (16) Residential mortgage 171,787 205,389 (16) 171,787 205,389 (16) Home Lending 203,339 242,850 (16) 203,339 242,850 (16) Card 159,571 147,881 8 159,571 147,881 8 Auto 61,410 63,619 (3) 61,410 63,619 (3) Total loans 451,019 480,801 (6) 451,019 480,801 (6) Core loans 405,662 425,917 (5) 405,662 425,917 (5) Deposits 701,170 677,260 4 701,170 677,260 4 Equity 52,000 51,000 2 52,000 51,000 2 Selected balance sheet data (average) Total assets $ 538,500 $ 551,080 (2) $ 544,833 $ 544,931 — Loans: Consumer & Business Banking 26,550 26,351 1 26,537 26,104 2 Home equity 32,215 38,211 (16) 33,694 39,951 (16) Residential mortgage 181,157 204,689 (11) 191,881 201,665 (5) Home Lending 213,372 242,900 (12) 225,575 241,616 (7) Card 158,168 146,272 8 154,375 143,986 7 Auto 61,371 64,060 (4) 62,118 65,096 (5) Total loans 459,461 479,583 (4) 468,605 476,802 (2) Core loans 413,036 422,582 (2) 419,851 415,662 1 Deposits 693,980 674,211 3 688,676 669,244 3 Equity 52,000 51,000 2 52,000 51,000 2 Headcount 127,687 129,891 (2)% 127,687 129,891 (2)% 26 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except ratio data) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Credit data and quality statistics Nonaccrual loans(a)(b) $ 3,099 $ 3,520 (12)% $ 3,099 $ 3,520 (12)% Net charge-offs/(recoveries)(c) Consumer & Business Banking 79 68 16 204 171 19 Home equity (25) (12) (108) (41) (3) NM Residential mortgage (17) (105) 84 (34) (252) 87 Home Lending (42) (117) 64 (75) (255) 71 Card 1,175 1,073 10 3,617 3,407 6 Auto 49 56 (13) 149 182 (18) Total net charge-offs/(recoveries) $ 1,261 $ 1,080 17 $ 3,895 $ 3,505 11 Net charge-off/(recovery) rate(c) Consumer & Business Banking 1.18% 1.02% 1.03% 0.88% Home equity(d) (0.41) (0.17) (0.22) (0.01) Residential mortgage(d) (0.04) (0.22) (0.03) (0.18) Home Lending(d) (0.09) (0.21) (0.05) (0.16) Card 2.95 2.91 3.13 3.16 Auto 0.32 0.35 0.32 0.37 Total net charge-off/(recovery) rate(d) 1.16 0.95 1.17 1.05 30+ day delinquency rate Home Lending(e)(f) 0.78% 0.81% 0.78% 0.81% Card 1.84 1.75 1.84 1.75 Auto 0.88 0.82 0.88 0.82 90+ day delinquency rate — Card 0.90 0.85 0.90 0.85 Allowance for loan losses Consumer & Business Banking $ 746 $ 796 (6) $ 746 $ 796 (6) Home Lending, excluding PCI loans 903 1,003 (10) 903 1,003 (10) Home Lending — PCI loans(c) 1,256 1,824 (31) 1,256 1,824 (31) Card 5,583 5,034 11 5,583 5,034 11 Auto 465 464 — 465 464 — Total allowance for loan losses(c) $ 8,953 $ 9,121 (2)% $ 8,953 $ 9,121 (2)% (a) Excludes PCI loans.

Net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 6%. Banking revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2%. • Investment Banking revenue was $1.9 billion, up 8%, driven by higher debt and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by lower advisory fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with overall share gains, according to Dealogic. – Debt underwriting fees were $961 million, up 17%, reflecting wallet share gains despite a decline in industry-wide fees, driven by participation in large acquisition financing deals and increased activity in investment-grade bonds. – Equity underwriting fees were $514 million, up 22%, driven by wallet share gains primarily in the IPO and convertible markets. – Advisory fees were $506 million, down 13%, driven by a decline in industry-wide fees compared to a strong prior year. • Treasury Services revenue was $1.1 billion, down 7%, driven by deposit margin compression partially offset by fee growth and higher balances. • Lending revenue was $329 million, down 1%. Markets & Securities Services revenue was $6.0 billion, up 9%. Markets revenue was $5.1 billion, up 14%. • Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.6 billion, up 25% compared to the prior year which reflected less favorable market conditions. The current quarter results were driven by strong client activity across products primarily in Rates, agency mortgage trading within Securitized Products and Commodities. • Equity Markets revenue was $1.5 billion, down 5% compared to a strong prior year. The current quarter results were driven by lower revenue in derivatives reflecting lower client activity and less favorable market conditions which were partially offset by higher revenue in Cash Equities. • Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, down 2%, with deposit margin compression largely offset by organic growth. The provision for credit losses was $92 million, largely driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses related to select emerging market client downgrades. The prior year was a benefit of $42 million reflecting a net recovery related to a loan sale. Noninterest expense was $5.3 billion, up 3%, driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expenses and investments, including compensation expense, largely offset by lower legal expenses and FDIC charges. Year-to-date results Net income was $9.0 billion, down 8%. Net revenue was $28.8 billion, down 1%. Banking revenue was $9.8 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year. • Investment Banking revenue was $5.4 billion, up 2%, with higher debt underwriting, predominantly offset by lower advisory and equity underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with overall share gains, according to Dealogic. – Debt underwriting fees were $2.7 billion, up 7%, reflecting wallet share gains despite a decline in industry-wide fees, driven by participation in large acquisition financing deals. – Advisory fees were $1.7 billion, down 6%, and Equity underwriting fees were $1.3 billion, down 4%, driven by a decline in industry-wide fees despite wallet share gains. • Treasury Services revenue was $3.4 billion, down 3%, with deposit margin compression predominantly offset by fee growth and higher balances. • Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, up 5%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income reflecting growth in loan balances. Markets & Securities Services revenue was $19.0 billion, down 2%. Markets revenue was $16.0 billion, down 3% which included a gain from the IPO of Tradeweb. In addition, prior year results included approximately $500 million of fair value gains related to the adoption of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost. • Fixed Income Markets revenue was $11.0 billion, up 1% reflecting higher revenue in agency mortgage trading within Securitized Products and Commodities partially offset by lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets. • Equity Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, down 11% compared to a strong prior year, predominantly driven by lower client activity in derivatives. • Securities Services revenue was $3.1 billion, down 4%, driven by deposit margin compression and the impact of a business exit partially offset by organic growth. • Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $5 million, compared with a loss of $130 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $179 million reflecting select C&I client downgrades including those in an emerging market. The prior year was a benefit of $142 million, primarily driven by loan sales and other activity related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio, partially offset by other net portfolio activity. Noninterest expense was $16.3 billion, flat compared to the prior year reflecting higher volume-related expenses and investments, including front office hires, as well as technology staff, predominantly offset by lower FDIC charges and revenue-related compensation expense. 30 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except headcount) 2019 2018 Change 2019 2018 Change Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Assets $ 1,023,132 $ 928,148 10% $ 1,023,132 $ 928,148 10% Loans: Loans retained(a) 118,290 117,084 1 118,290 117,084 1 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 8,324 6,133 36 8,324 6,133 36 Total loans 126,614 123,217 3 126,614 123,217 3 Core loans 126,445 122,953 3 126,445 122,953 3 Equity 80,000 70,000 14 80,000 70,000 14 Selected balance sheet data (average) Assets $ 1,003,395 $ 924,909 8 $ 985,503 $ 924,145 7 Trading assets-debt and equity instruments 415,450 349,390 19 406,304 354,270 15 Trading assets-derivative receivables 48,266 62,025 (22) 49,221 60,943 (19) Loans: Loans retained(a) $ 119,007 $ 115,390 3 $ 123,368 $ 112,921 9 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 8,344 7,328 14 8,239 6,263 32 Total loans $ 127,351 $ 122,718 4 $ 131,607 $ 119,184 10 Core loans 127,187 122,442 4 131,436 118,877 11 Equity 80,000 70,000 14 80,000 70,000 14 Headcount 55,873 54,052 3% 55,873 54,052 3% (a) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans, loans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for- investment loans and overdrafts.

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 69 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information.

Noninterest revenue was $599 million, an increase of 4%, predominantly driven by strong investment banking performance due to increased equity underwriting and M&A activity. Noninterest expense was $881 million, up 3%, predominantly driven by investments in the business, largely offset by lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $67 million, compared with a benefit of $15 million in the prior year. Year-to-date results Net income was $3.0 billion, a decrease of 7%. Net revenue of $6.8 billion was flat. Net interest income was $5.0 billion, a decrease of 1%, driven by lower loan spreads and lower deposit balances, largely offset by higher deposit margins. Noninterest revenue was $1.8 billion, up 3% driven by higher investment banking revenue, predominantly due to increased equity underwriting and M&A activity. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, an increase of 3%, predominantly driven by continued investments in the business, largely offset by lower FDIC charges.

(b) Included a net legal benefit of $(32) million and $(175) million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $(189) million and $(225) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (c) Average core loans were $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.7 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Quarterly results Net income was $393 million, compared with a net loss of $145 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $692 million, compared with a net loss of $103 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income and noninterest revenue. Net interest income was driven by balance sheet growth and changes in mix, partially offset by lower rates. Net interest income also includes income related to the unwind of the internal funding provided to CCB upon the sale of certain mortgage loans. The income reflects the net present value of that funding and is recognized as a charge to net interest income in CCB. Refer to CCB on pages 23–24 of this Form 10-Q and Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) on page 60 of the Firm’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information. Noninterest revenue increased reflecting small net gains on certain legacy private equity investments compared to net losses in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $281 million was up $253 million due to higher investments in technology and a lower net legal benefit compared with the prior year. The current period included tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits as well as other tax adjustments, which were partially offset by changes to certain tax reserves. The prior year reflected a net benefit of $132 million resulting from changes in estimates under the TCJA related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings, which was more than offset by changes to certain tax reserves and other tax adjustments. Year-to-date results Net income was $1.5 billion, compared with a net loss of $664 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss of $255 million in the prior year driven by higher net interest income and noninterest revenue. Net interest income was 43 driven by balance sheet growth and changes in mix and includes the income related to the unwind of the internal funding, as mentioned above. Noninterest revenue increased reflecting: • investment securities gains compared with losses in the prior year due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio • lower net valuation losses on certain legacy private equity investments, partially offset by • losses on cash deployment transactions which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions. Noninterest expense of $724 million, was up $330 million reflecting: • higher investments in technology and real estate, • contributions to the Firm’s Foundation, whereas all prior- year contributions were made in the fourth quarter, and • higher pension costs due to changes to actuarial assumptions and estimates. The prior year included a $174 million loss on the liquidation of a legal entity. The current period included tax benefits of $957 million related to the resolution of certain tax audits, as well as other tax adjustments partially offset by changes in certain tax reserves. The prior year expense reflected changes to certain tax reserves, largely offset by a net benefit of $305 million resulting from changes in estimates under the TCJA related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings as well as other tax adjustments. Treasury and CIO overview At September 30, 2019, the average credit rating of the Treasury and CIO investment securities comprising the portfolio in the table below was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s).

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses and the associated risks in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires: • Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the lines of business and Corporate; and • Firmwide structures for risk governance. The Firm strives for continual improvement through efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent Board oversight. The impact of risk and control issues are carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Refer to pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Enterprise-wide risk management governance and oversight. Effective July 2019, the Board of Directors’ Risk Policy Committee (“DRPC”) was renamed the Risk Committee. The committee’s responsibilities were not changed. Refer to page 81 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the committee. Governance and Oversight Functions The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2018 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

Refer to pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and stress testing. The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies (“BHC”) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the fully phased- in measures under Basel III and represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 the calculations were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis. The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk- based ratios, and the Firm expects that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future. Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on SLR. The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital measures under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm’s Basel III ratios exceeded regulatory minimums as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics.

Line of business equity Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2019, line of business capital allocations have increased due to a combination of changes in the relative weights, with greater emphasis on Standardized RWA and stress, a higher capitalization rate, updated stress simulations, and general business growth. Refer to page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information. The following table represents the capital allocated to each business segment: (in billions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Consumer & Community Banking $ 52.0 $ 51.0 Corporate & Investment Bank 80.0 70.0 Commercial Banking 22.0 20.0 Asset & Wealth Management 10.5 9.0 Corporate 71.5 80.4 Total common stockholders’ equity $ 236.0 $ 230.4 Planning and stress testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2019 capital plan.

Morgan Securities JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also registered as a futures commission merchant and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). Refer to Capital risk management on pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion on J.P. Morgan Securities’ capital requirements. The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities’ net capital: September 30, 2019 (in millions) Actual Minimum Net Capital $ 22,068 $ 3,746 J.P. Morgan Securities plc J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). Refer to Capital risk management on pages 85-94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion on J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Effective January 1, 2019, the Bank of England requires, on a transitional basis, that U.K. banks, including U.K. regulated subsidiaries of overseas groups, maintain a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (“MREL”). As of September 30, 2019, J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with the requirements of the MREL rule. Refer to Supervision and Regulation on pages 1-6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on MREL. The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities plc’s capital metrics: September 30, 2019 (in millions, except ratios) Estimated Minimum ratios Total capital $ 55,614 CET1 ratio 16.9% 4.5% Total capital ratio 21.5% 8.0% 50 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 95–100 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K and the Firm’s US LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires the Firm to maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of unencumbered cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%. Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. that is in excess of its standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA. The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the finalized LCR framework. Three months ended Average amount (in millions) September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 HQLA Eligible cash(a) $ 199,757 $ 219,838 $ 344,660 Eligible securities(b)(c) 337,704 317,439 190,349 Total HQLA(d) $ 537,461 $ 537,277 $ 535,009 Net cash outflows $ 468,452 $ 477,442 $ 466,803 LCR 115% 113% 115% Net excess HQLA(d) $ 69,009 $ 59,835 $ 68,206 (a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and U.S. government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rules. (c) HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the three- month period ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to a decline in the net cash outflows from CIB activities. The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources As of September 30, 2019, in addition to assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA, the Firm had approximately $312 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity. This includes HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. As of September 30, 2019, the Firm also had approximately $313 billion of available borrowing capacity at FHLBs, the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank, and other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. 51 Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm’s loan portfolio is funded with a portion of the Firm’s deposits, through securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm’s real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the FHLBs. Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments are primarily funded by the Firm’s securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities-debt and equity instruments, and a portion of the Firm’s long-term debt and stockholders’ equity. In addition to funding securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments, proceeds from the Firm’s debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Refer to the discussion below for additional information relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance. Deposits The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposit balances as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and the average deposit balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Deposits Average Average (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Consumer & Community Banking $ 701,170 $ 678,854 $ 693,980 $ 674,211 $ 688,676 $ 669,244 Corporate & Investment Bank 510,403 482,084 524,521 476,995 509,775 472,879 Commercial Banking 174,903 170,859 172,653 168,102 169,361 171,403 Asset & Wealth Management 138,439 138,546 138,822 133,021 139,127 138,885 Corporate 346 323 904 533 887 736 Total Firm $ 1,525,261 $ 1,470,666 $ 1,530,880 $ 1,452,862 $ 1,507,826 $ 1,453,147 Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. (in billions except ratios) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Deposits $ 1,525.3 $ 1,470.7 Deposits as a % of total liabilities 61% 62% Loans $ 945.2 $ 984.6 Loans-to-deposits ratio 62% 67% The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. Average deposits increased for the three months ended September 30, 2019. • The increase in CIB reflects an increase in operating deposits predominantly in Treasury Services driven by growth in client activity, and an increase in the net issuances of structured notes in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by growth in new accounts. The increase in AWM was driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits on new client activity. The increase in CB was primarily driven by growth from existing clients. Average deposits increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 in CIB and CCB, partially offset by a decline in CB. Balances in AWM were relatively flat. • The increase in CIB reflects an increase in operating deposits predominantly in Treasury Services driven by growth in client activity, and an increase in the net issuances of structured notes in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by growth in new accounts. • The decrease in CB was primarily driven by lower non operating deposits. • AWM balances were relatively flat with growth in interest- bearing deposits offset by migration predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products. Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 21–43 and pages 15-16, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends. 52 The following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and average balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Short-term funding The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase at September 30, 2019, from December 31, 2018, was driven by CIB and includes the Firm’s participation in the Federal Reserve’s open market operations, as well as higher secured financing of trading assets-debt instruments and client-driven activities. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial paper at September 30, 2019, from December 31, 2018, was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management. 53 Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 95-100 and Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and advances from the FHLBs. The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further description of the client-driven loan securitizations. 54 Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 18, and liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of September 30, 2019, were as follows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.(a) J.P.

The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools is performing. (h) Net charge-offs/(recoveries) and the net charge-off/(recovery) rates excluded write-offs in the PCI portfolio of $43 million and $58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $132 million and $151 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These write- offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67–68 for further information. (i) Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $5.5 billion and $196 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2.6 billion and $240 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates. 57 Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Loan balances decreased from December 31, 2018 due to lower residential real estate loans, predominantly driven by loan sales. The credit performance of the portfolio continues to benefit from a strong labor market and improvement in home prices. The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products, excluding PCI loans which are addressed separately. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators. Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans. The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2018 driven by loan sales in Home Lending as well as paydowns, largely offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were lower when compared with the same periods in the prior year as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales. At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included $21.8 billion and $21.6 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was in line with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same period. The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government- insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Current $ 2,100 $ 2,884 30-89 days past due 1,054 1,528 90 or more days past due 1,602 2,600 Total government guaranteed loans $ 4,756 $ 7,012 Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from December 31, 2018 primarily reflecting loan paydowns. At September 30, 2019, approximately 90% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $23 billion at September 30, 2019. This amount included $10 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $4 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. Refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 106–111 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s home equity portfolio. Auto: The auto loan portfolio predominantly consists of prime-quality loans. The portfolio declined when compared with December 31, 2018, as paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans were predominantly offset by new originations. Consumer & Business Banking: Consumer & Business Banking loans were flat when compared with December 31, 2018 as loan originations were offset by paydowns and charge-offs of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased when compared with the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher deposit overdraft losses. Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans represent certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit- impaired on the acquisition date. PCI loans decreased from December 31, 2018 due to portfolio run off. As of September 30, 2019, approximately 9% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 71% of the portfolio had been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining option ARM loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment. 58 The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses. Summary of PCI loans lifetime principal loss estimates Lifetime loss estimates(a) Life-to-date liquidation losses(b) (in billions) Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Home equity $ 13.9 $ 14.1 $ 13.0 $ 13.0 Prime mortgage 4.1 4.1 3.9 3.9 Subprime mortgage 3.3 3.3 3.2 3.2 Option ARMs 10.3 10.3 10.0 9.9 Total $ 31.6 $ 31.8 $ 30.1 $ 30.0 (a) Includes the original nonaccretable difference established in purchase accounting of $30.5 billion for principal losses plus additional principal losses recognized subsequent to acquisition through the provision and allowance for loan losses. The remaining nonaccretable difference for principal losses was $476 million and $512 million at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. (b) Represents both realization of loss upon loan resolution and any principal forgiven upon modification. Geographic composition of residential real estate loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s residential real estate loans. Current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices, customer paydowns, and charge-offs or liquidations of higher LTV loans. Refer to Note 11 for information on current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate loans. Loan modification activities for residential real estate loans The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolios as measured through redefault rates, were not materially different from December 31, 2018. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 106–111 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s redefault rates. Certain modified loans have interest rate reset provisions (“step-rate modifications”) where the interest rates on these loans generally began to increase commencing in 2014 by 1% per year, and will continue to do so, until the rate reaches a specified cap. The cap on these loans is typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate mortgage loan as of the modification date. At September 30, 2019, the carrying value of non-PCI loans and the unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications, which have not yet met their specified caps, were $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. The Firm continues to monitor this risk exposure and the impact of these potential interest rate increases is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. The following table presents information as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Refer to Note 11 for further information on modifications for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Modified residential real estate loans September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions) Retained loans Non- accrual retained loans(d) Retained loans Non- accrual retained loans(d) Modified residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans(a)(b) Residential mortgage $ 4,118 $ 1,376 $ 4,565 $ 1,459 Home equity 1,961 981 2,012 955 Total modified residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans $ 6,079 $ 2,357 $ 6,577 $ 2,414 Modified PCI loans(c) Home equity $ 2,003 NA $ 2,086 NA Prime mortgage 2,929 NA 3,179 NA Subprime mortgage 1,919 NA 2,041 NA Option ARMs 5,879 NA 6,410 NA Total modified PCI loans $ 12,730 NA $ 13,716 NA (a) Amounts represent the carrying value of modified residential real estate loans. (b) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, $16 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae. (c) Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans. (d) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans included $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status. 59 Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets(a) (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Nonaccrual loans(b) Residential real estate $ 2,839 $ 3,088 Other consumer 380 373 Total nonaccrual loans 3,219 3,461 Assets acquired in loan satisfactions Real estate owned(c) 209 196 Other 26 30 Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions 235 226 Total nonperforming assets $ 3,454 $ 3,687 (a) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and REO insured by U.S. government agencies of $50 million and $75 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (b) Excludes PCI loans, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans as each of the pools is performing. (c) The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio at September 30, 2019 decreased to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion at December 31, 2018, of which 20% and 24% were greater than 150 days past due, respectively. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 31% and 32% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Nonaccrual loan activity Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 3,461 $ 4,209 Additions 1,674 2,174 Reductions: Principal payments and other(a) 766 1,119 Charge-offs 301 354 Returned to performing status 657 1,057 Foreclosures and other liquidations 192 217 Total reductions 1,916 2,747 Net changes (242) (573) Ending balance $ 3,219 $ 3,636 (a) Other reductions includes loan sales. Active and suspended foreclosure: Refer to Note 11 for information on loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. Credit card Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2018 reflecting increased sales volumes from existing customers and new account growth, partially offset by the impact of seasonality. The September 30, 2019 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.84% and 0.90%, respectively, were relatively flat compared to the December 31, 2018 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.83% and 0.92%, respectively. Net charge-offs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared with the same period in the prior year due to loan growth, in line with expectations. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and reduces interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans. Modifications of credit card loans At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Firm had $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 11 for additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers. 60 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The credit performance of the wholesale portfolio remained favorable for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, characterized by continued low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 62–64 for further information. Loans held-for-sale decreased, driven by a loan syndication in CIB. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. It excludes all exposure managed by CCB, scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. (d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is based on the remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30, 2019, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 62 Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $12.8 billion at September 30, 2019, compared with $12.1 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by select client downgrades across a number of sectors. Below are summaries of the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

Loans In the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators and sales of loans. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Wholesale nonaccrual loan activity Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 1,370 $ 1,734 Additions 1,907 570 Reductions: Paydowns and other 1,097 541 Gross charge-offs 235 251 Returned to performing status 25 217 Sales 188 287 Total reductions 1,545 1,296 Net changes 362 (726) Ending balance $ 1,732 $ 1,008 The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans. Wholesale net charge-offs/ (recoveries) (in millions, except ratios) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Loans – reported Average loans retained $ 433,744 $420,597 $ 434,434 $ 413,537 Gross charge- offs 120 23 270 264 Gross recoveries (12) (70) (34) (146) Net charge- offs/ (recoveries) 108 (47) 236 118 Net charge- off/ (recovery) rate 0.10% (0.04)% 0.07% 0.04% 65 Lending-related commitments The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfill its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring. In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments. Derivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of derivative contracts. The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented. Derivative receivables (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Total, net of cash collateral 55,577 54,213 Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(a) (15,482) (15,322) Total, net of collateral $ 40,095 $ 38,891 (a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting agreements. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $55.6 billion and $54.2 billion at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $15.5 billion and $15.3 billion at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements. 66 The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as assigned by S&P and Moody’s. Ratings profile of derivative receivables Rating equivalent September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions, except ratios) Exposure net of all collateral % of exposure net of all collateral Exposure net of all collateral % of exposure net of all collateral AAA/Aaa to AA-/Aa3 $ 10,663 27% $ 11,831 31% A+/A1 to A-/A3 6,106 15 7,428 19 BBB+/Baa1 to BBB-/Baa3 15,766 39 12,536 32 BB+/Ba1 to B-/B3 7,116 18 6,373 16 CCC+/Caa1 and below 444 1 723 2 Total $ 40,095 100% $ 38,891 100% As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative contracts subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 90% at both September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Credit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit portfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities Notional amount of protection purchased and sold(a) (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Credit derivatives used to manage: Loans and lending-related commitments $ 1,726 $ 1,272 Derivative receivables 13,305 11,410 Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities $ 15,031 $ 12,682 (a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 4 of this Form 10-Q and Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities. 67 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 76–77 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q, and Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 141-143 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of September 30, 2019, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses decreased compared with December 31, 2018, driven by: • a $550 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan losses, which includes $400 million in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 million in the business banking portfolio; as well as • a $132 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans, predominantly offset by • a $400 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio reflecting higher loss rates, as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio and loan growth; as well as • a $170 million addition in the wholesale allowance for credit losses largely driven by select C&I client downgrades. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 56–59, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 60–66 and Note 11 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios. 68 Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses 2019 2018 Nine months ended September 30, Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(in millions, except ratios) Allowance for loan losses Beginning balance at January 1, $ 4,146 $ 5,184 $ 4,115 $ 13,445 $ 4,579 $ 4,884 $ 4,141 $ 13,604 Gross charge-offs 702 4,050 270 5,022 776 3,777 264 4,817 Gross recoveries (420) (433) (34) (887) (681) (370) (146) (1,197) Net charge-offs 282 3,617 236 4,135 95 3,407 118 3,620 Write-offs of PCI loans(a) 132 — — 132 151 — — 151 Provision for loan losses (265) 4,017 296 4,048 (152) 3,557 (111) 3,294 Other — (1) 10 9 1 — — 1 Ending balance at September 30, $ 3,467 $ 5,583 $ 4,185 $ 13,235 $ 4,182 $ 5,034 $ 3,912 $ 13,128 Impairment methodology Asset-specific(b) $ 145 $ 488 $ 342 $ 975 $ 204 $ 421 $ 280 $ 905 Formula-based 2,066 5,095 3,843 11,004 2,154 4,613 3,632 10,399 PCI 1,256 — — 1,256 1,824 — — 1,824 Total allowance for loan losses $ 3,467 $ 5,583 $ 4,185 $ 13,235 $ 4,182 $ 5,034 $ 3,912 $ 13,128 Allowance for lending-related commitments Beginning balance at January 1, $ 33 $ — $ 1,022 $ 1,055 $ 33 $ — $ 1,035 $ 1,068 Provision for lending-related commitments — — 110 110 — — 29 29 Other — — — — — — — — Ending balance at September 30, $ 33 $ — $ 1,132 $ 1,165 $ 33 $ — $ 1,064 $ 1,097 Impairment methodology Asset-specific $ — $ — $ 135 $ 135 $ — $ — $ 71 $ 71 Formula-based 33 — 997 1,030 33 — 993 1,026 Total allowance for lending-related commitments(c) $ 33 $ — $ 1,132 $ 1,165 $ 33 $ — $ 1,064 $ 1,097 Total allowance for credit losses $ 3,500 $ 5,583 $ 5,317 $ 14,400 $ 4,215 $ 5,034 $ 4,976 $ 14,225 Memo: Retained loans, end of period $331,809 $ 159,571 $ 437,507 $928,887 $375,958 $147,856 $ 423,837 $947,651 Retained loans, average 355,865 154,367 434,434 944,666 374,298 143,931 413,537 931,766 PCI loans, end of period 21,290 — — 21,290 25,209 — 3 25,212 Credit ratios Allowance for loan losses to retained loans 1.04% 3.50% 0.96% 1.42% 1.11% 3.40% 0.92% 1.39% Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(d) 108 NM 285 282 115 NM 394 284 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card 108 NM 285 163 115 NM 394 175 Net charge-off rates 0.11 3.13 0.07 0.59 0.03 3.16 0.04 0.52 Credit ratios, excluding residential real estate PCI loans Allowance for loan losses to retained loans 0.71 3.50 0.96 1.32 0.67 3.40 0.92 1.23 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(d) 69 NM 285 256 65 NM 394 244 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card 69 NM 285 136 65 NM 394 135 Net charge-off rates 0.11% 3.13% 0.07% 0.60% 0.04% 3.16% 0.04% 0.54% Note: In the table above, the financial measures which exclude the impact of PCI loans are non-GAAP financial measures. (a) Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool. (b) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. (c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. 69 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio held predominantly by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives or from principal investments managed in the LOBs and Corporate in predominantly privately-held financial instruments. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that Treasury and CIO substantially invest in high-quality securities. At September 30, 2019, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was $392.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 42–43 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 70–74 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk on pages 50–54 for further information on related liquidity risk. Principal investment risk Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments span multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. In general, new principal investments include tax-oriented investments, as well as investments made to enhance or accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $23.3 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments) of $16.7 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.6 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. Refer to page 123 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight. 70 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 124–131 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lines of business and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results.

VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated. (b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across lines of business, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful. Quarter over quarter results Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared with the prior quarter. This reflects a reduction in risk across the Fixed Income and Foreign Exchange risk types, as well as a decrease in the Equities risk type driven by certain CIB investments, including Tradeweb. Year over year results Average total VaR increased by $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the same period in the prior year. The increase in average total VaR is primarily due to increased exposure in the Fixed Income risk type, as well as an increase in the Equities risk type in CIB driven by the inclusion of Tradeweb following the IPO in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, average CCB VaR has increased by $5 million, driven by mortgage servicing rights risk management activities. 72 VaR back-testing The Firm performs daily VaR model back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk related revenue. The Firm’s definition of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments, net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading. The following chart compares actual daily market risk-related gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of back-testing disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to CIB’s covered positions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Firm observed five VaR back- testing exceptions and posted market risk-related gains on 116 of the 194 days. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Firm observed three VaR back-testing exceptions and posted market risk-related gains on 35 of the 66 days. Daily Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses vs. Risk Management VaR (1-day, 95% Confidence level) Nine months ended September 30, 2019 Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses Risk Management VaR First Quarter 2019 Second Quarter 2019 Third Quarter 2019 73 Earnings-at-risk The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a summary by line of business and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates or decreasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: • The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized deposit betas over the cycle. These normalized deposit betas represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to repricing lags and other factors. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to 2019 Outlook on page 8 for additional information). The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. (in billions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.7 $ 0.9 -100 bps shift in rates (2.6) (2.1) Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 0.9 0.5 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.9) (1.2) Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.2) 0.4 -100 bps shift in long-term rates (1.6) (0.9) The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 reflected updating the Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. The Firm’s sensitivity to short-term rates decreased as a result of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet primarily offset by updating the Firm’s baseline to reflect lower rates. The Firm’s sensitivity to long-term rates increased primarily as a result of updating the Firm’s baseline to reflect lower rates and is more impactful to the downward scenario due to the Firm’s sensitivity to mortgage prepayments. The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. (in billions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.5 $ 0.5 Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.5 0.5 The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 74 Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and OCI due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the table Predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 125 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration in these sensitivities.

Refer to Note 2 for additional information. (b) Impact recognized through OCI. 75 COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT The Firm, through its lines of business and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 132–133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2019 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2018. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending- related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. Refer to pages 120–122, page 141 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 67–68 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q. As noted in the discussion on page 141 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Refer to Note 12 for further information. To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of September 30, 2019, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses: • A combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply: an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $250 million for PCI loans. an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $50 million for residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans. • For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $800 million. • An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1.7 billion. • A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $175 million. The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. 77 Fair value Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information. September 30, 2019 (in billions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Trading–debt and equity instruments $ 440.2 $ 4.4 Derivative receivables(a) 55.6 5.6 Trading assets 495.8 10.0 AFS securities 353.4 — Loans 5.8 — MSRs 4.4 4.4 Other 27.8 0.7 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 887.2 $ 15.1 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 6.4 1.0 Total assets measured at fair value $ 893.6 $ 16.1 Total Firm assets $ 2,764.7 Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 0.6% Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 1.8% (a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $5.6 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Valuation Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Goodwill impairment Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2019. Credit card rewards liability The credit card rewards liability was $6.3 billion and $5.8 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and judgments associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. Income taxes Refer to Income taxes on page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. Litigation reserves Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves. 78 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted January 1, 2019 Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Leases Issued February 2016 • Requires lessees to recognize all leases longer than twelve months on the Consolidated balance sheets as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset. • Requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” classification tests. • Expands qualitative and quantitative leasing disclosures. • Adopted January 1, 2019. • The Firm elected the available practical expedient to not reassess whether existing contracts contain a lease or whether classification or unamortized initial lease costs would be different under the new lease guidance. The Firm elected the modified retrospective transition method, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings without revising prior periods. • Refer to Note 16 for further information. FASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Financial instruments – credit losses Issued June 2016 • Replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost, which will reflect management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the financial assets and will consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. • Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to the allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, with a corresponding increase in the recorded investment of the related loans. • Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral dependent assets). • Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. • Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • The Firm has established a Firmwide, cross-discipline governance structure, which provides implementation oversight. The Firm continues to test and refine its current expected credit loss models that satisfy the requirements of the new standard. Oversight and testing, as well as efforts to meet expanded disclosure requirements, will extend through the remainder of 2019. • The Firm expects that the allowance related to the Firm’s loans and commitments will increase as it will cover credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolios. The Firm currently intends to estimate losses over a two-year forecast period using the weighted-average of a range of macroeconomic scenarios (established on a Firmwide basis), and then revert to longer term historical loss experience to estimate losses over more extended periods. • The Firm currently expects the increase in the allowance to be in the range of $4-6 billion, primarily driven by Card. This estimate is subject to further refinement based on continuing reviews and approvals of models, methodologies and judgments. The ultimate impact will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Firm’s portfolio at the adoption date, the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date, and other management judgments. • The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020. Goodwill Issued January 2017 • Requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. • Eliminates the second condition in the current guidance that requires an impairment loss to be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • Based on current impairment test results, the Firm does not expect a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the impact of the new accounting guidance will depend on the performance of the reporting units and the market conditions at the time of adoption. • After adoption, the guidance may result in more frequent goodwill impairment losses due to the removal of the second condition. • The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020. (a) Early adoption is permitted. 79 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to investors, analysts, representatives of the media and others.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly presented. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Income tax expense The Firm’s effective tax rate was 20.4% and 17.9% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and 21.6% and 20.4% in the respective 2018 periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the effective tax rate reflected the recognition of $1.0 billion in tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits, which reduced the Firm’s effective tax rate by 3.0%. Refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information. Note 2 – Fair value measurement Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy. 86 The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

234,238 (a) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $133.6 billion and $92.3 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related. (b) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, included within trading loans were $16.1 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $4.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $10.3 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 88 inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $714 million and $747 million, respectively. Included in these balances at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, were trading assets of $48 million and $49 million, respectively, and other assets of $666 million and $698 million, respectively. (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Level 3 valuations Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/ or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at September 30, 2019, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range; equity correlation, equity-FX, and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated towards the upper end of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating the fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate inputs used in estimating the fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads and conditional default rates were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; loss severity inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range and price inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. 89 Level 3 inputs(a) September 30, 2019 Product/Instrument Fair value (in millions) Principal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g) Range of input values Weighted average Residential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b) $ 1,132 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% – 19% 5% Prepayment speed 0% – 22% 14% Conditional default rate 0% – 4% 1% Loss severity 0% – 100% 2% Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c) 147 Market comparables Price $ 0 – $ 102 $ 80 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 627 Market comparables Price $ 68 – $ 100 $ 97 Corporate debt securities 484 Market comparables Price $ 4 – $ 116 $ 79 Loans(d) 194 Discounted cash flows Yield 5% – 22% 7% 1,115 Market comparables Price $ 12 – $ 101 $ 78 Asset-backed securities 38 Market comparables Price $ 1 – $ 100 $ 53 Net interest rate derivatives (388) Option pricing Interest rate spread volatility 20 bps – 30 bps Interest rate correlation (28)% – 96% IR-FX correlation 53% – 60% 69 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 4% – 30% Net credit derivatives (353) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 30% – 60% Credit spread 4 bps – 1,315 bps Recovery rate 15% – 70% Conditional default rate 2% – 93% Loss severity 100% 36 Market comparables Price $ 1 – $ 115 Net foreign exchange derivatives (679) Option pricing IR-FX correlation (58)% – 60% (162) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 9% Net equity derivatives (3,468) Option pricing Equity volatility 11% – 82% Equity correlation 10% – 98% Equity-FX correlation (81)% – 59% Equity-IR correlation 25% – 60% Net commodity derivatives (47) Option pricing Forward commodity price $ 30 – $ 61 per barrel Commodity volatility 5% – 111% Commodity correlation (48)% – 95% MSRs 4,419 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 14 Other assets 303 Discounted cash flows Credit spread 45 bps 45 bps Yield 12% 12% 775 Market comparables Price $ 18 – $ 115 $ 36 Long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e) 27,986 Option pricing Interest rate spread volatility 20 bps – 30 bps Interest rate correlation (28)% – 96% IR-FX correlation (58)% – 60% Equity correlation 10% – 98% Equity-FX correlation (81)% – 59% Equity-IR correlation 25% – 60% Other level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f) 229 (a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) Comprises U.S. GSEs and government agency securities of $811 million, nonagency securities of $24 million and trading loans of $297 million. (c) Comprises nonagency securities of $5 million, trading loans of $141 million and non-trading loans of $1 million. (d) Comprises trading loans. (e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. 90 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments. 91 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Three months ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Fair value at July 1, 2019 Total realized/ unrealized

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes Level 3 assets, including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were 0.6% of total Firm assets at September 30, 2019. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2018, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 97 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 Level 3 assets were $15.1 billion at September 30, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion from June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was predominantly driven by a reduction of $674 million in MSRs and a reduction of $619 million in gross equity derivative receivables due to settlements. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was predominantly driven by a reduction of approximately $1.7 billion in MSRs. Refer to the Gains and losses section below for additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no individually significant transfers from level 2 to level 3. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, individually significant transfers from level 3 to level 2 included $906 million and $927 million, respectively of gross commodities derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, there were no individually significant transfers from level 2 to level 3. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, significant transfers from level 2 to level 3 included the following: • $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, there were no individually significant transfers from level 3 to level 2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, significant transfers from level 3 to level 2 included the following: • $1.2 billion of total debt and equity instruments, the majority of which were trading loans, driven by an increase in observability. • $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.2 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 90–95 for further information on these instruments. 96 Three months ended September 30, 2019 • $1.6 billion of net losses on assets, predominantly driven by net derivative receivables due to market movements and MSRs largely reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. • $205 million of net losses on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Three months ended September 30, 2018 • $394 million of net gains on assets and $100 million of net gains on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Nine months ended September 30, 2019 • $2.5 billion of net losses on assets, driven by net derivative receivables due to market movements and MSRs reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. • $2.3 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by market movements in long-term debt. Nine months ended September 30, 2018 • $2.1 billion of net gains on assets predominantly driven by market movements in derivative receivables. • $722 million of net gains on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Of the $775 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019, $638 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. (b) Primarily includes certain mortgage loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale. (c) Of the $246 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019, $200 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 14% to 49% with a weighted average of 29%. There were no material liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2019 and 2018. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, related to assets held at those dates.

(b) Primarily includes the impact of certain mortgage loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). 98 Equity securities without readily determinable fair values The Firm measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 were $(197) million. Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B shares, recorded at a nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa Class A shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is 1.6228 at September 30, 2019, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. 99 Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value The following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(b) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 161 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments. 100 Note 3 – Fair value option Refer to Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant. Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. (e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense. 102 Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding Loans(a) Nonaccrual loans Loans reported as trading assets $ 3,884 $ 1,151 $ (2,733) $ 4,240 $ 1,350 $ (2,890) Loans 181 151 (30) 39 — (39) Subtotal 4,065 1,302 (2,763) 4,279 1,350 (2,929) All other performing loans Loans reported as trading assets 45,315 43,903 (1,412) 42,215 40,403 (1,812) Loans 5,686 5,609 (77) 3,186 3,151 (35) Total loans $ 55,066 $ 50,814 $ (4,252) $ 49,680 $ 44,904 $ (4,776) Long-term debt Principal-protected debt $ 40,750 (c) $ 37,635 $ (3,115) $ 32,674 (c) $ 28,718 $ (3,956) Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA 34,322 NA NA 26,168 NA Total long-term debt NA $ 71,957 NA NA $ 54,886 NA Long-term beneficial interests Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA $ 39 NA NA $ 28 NA Total long-term beneficial interests NA $ 39 NA NA $ 28 NA (a) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. (b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (c) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(91) million and $(82) million, respectively. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments. Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk component The following table presents the fair value of structured notes, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts. While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments. 105 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated balance sheets The following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.

Refer to Note 3 for further information. (b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. 106 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. (c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $78.8 billion and $55.2 billion at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $62.4 billion and $43.3 billion at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. 108 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 15,466 $ 9,396 Collateral posted 14,388 8,907 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 223 $ 1,420 $ 76 $ 947 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 184 1,475 172 764 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 109 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. The initial amount of the excluded components may be amortized into income over the life of the derivative, or changes in fair value may be recognized in current period earnings. (f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 110 As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Given the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying amount excluded for available-for- sale securities is $15.3 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $4.1 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. (d) Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date. 111 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (16) $ 290 $ 306 Foreign exchange(b) (21) (68) (47) Total $ (37) $ 222 $ 259 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended September 30, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 10 $ (30) $ (40) Foreign exchange(b) (19) (92) (73) Total $ (9) $ (122) $ (113) Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Nine months ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (12) $ 501 $ 513 Foreign exchange(b) (90) (37) 53 Total $ (102) $ 464 $ 566 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Nine months ended September 30, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 36 $ (141) $ (177) Foreign exchange(b) 26 (224) (250) Total $ 62 $ (365) $ (427) (a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(130) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at September 30, 2019, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately five years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 112 Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income. (b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Firm reclassified net pre-tax gains of $5 million to other income related to the liquidation of certain legal entities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Firm reclassified net pre-tax losses of $23 million to other expense related to the liquidation of a legal entity. (c) The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 769 $ (42) $ 1,718 $ (277) Credit(b) (21) (7) (33) (17) Foreign exchange(c) 40 52 15 167 (d) Total $ 788 $ 3 $ 1,700 $ (127) (d) (a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (d) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue. 113 Credit derivatives Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of September 30, 2019, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Further, the Firm did not recognize any credit-related OTTI losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Accordingly, the Firm believes that the investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of September 30, 2019, are not other-than-temporarily impaired. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on other-than-temporary impairment. Investment securities gains and losses The following table presents realized gains and losses and OTTI from AFS securities that were recognized in income.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 5 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 122 Note 10 – Securities financing activities Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

In the Consolidated balance sheets, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities. (b) Includes securities financing agreements accounted for at fair value. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, included securities purchased under resale agreements of $13.7 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively; securities sold under repurchase agreements of $933 million and $935 million, respectively; and securities borrowed of $5.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value in either period. (c) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related net asset or liability with that counterparty. (d) Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, included $9.1 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $30.6 billion and $30.3 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $21.9 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively, of securities sold under repurchase agreements; and $96 million and $25 million, respectively, of securities loaned and other. 123 The tables below present as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 124 Note 11 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value • PCI loans held-for-investment Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f) Residential real estate – excluding PCI • Residential mortgage(b) • Home equity(c) Other consumer loans(d) • Auto • Consumer & Business Banking(e) Residential real estate – PCI • Home equity • Prime mortgage • Subprime mortgage • Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial • Real estate • Financial institutions • Governments & Agencies • Other(g) (a) Includes loans held in CCB, scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. (b) Predominantly includes prime loans (including option ARMs). (c) Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans. (d) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes. (e) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans. (f) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.

(b) Loans (other than PCI loans and loans for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. 125 The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held- for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table. 2019 2018 Three months ended September 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 259 (a)(b) $ — $ 453 $ 712 $ 561 (a)(b) $ — $ 285 $ 846 Sales 14,970 — 5,559 20,529 1,789 — 4,197 5,986 Retained loans reclassified to held- for-sale 3,889 — 359 4,248 — — 666 666 2019 2018 Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 1,044 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,041 $ 2,085 $ 2,164 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,915 $ 4,079 Sales 30,484 — 16,404 46,888 4,661 — 12,829 17,490 Retained loans reclassified to held- for-sale 8,950 — 1,784 10,734 36 — 1,926 1,962 (a) Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (b) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $12.2 billion and $14.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of loans Net gains on sales of loans (including adjustments to record loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue were $254 million and $433 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of loans were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(b) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $47 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, these balances included $38 million and $999 million, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. (d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (f) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2019. (g) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $67 million and $6.9 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee. 127 Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table provides the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate (in millions, except ratios) Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 HELOCs:(a) Within the revolving period(b) $ 5,625 $ 5,608 0.37% 0.25% Beyond the revolving period 9,283 11,286 2.47 2.80 HELOANs 827 1,030 2.42 2.82 Total $ 15,735 $ 17,924 1.72% 2.00% (a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period. (b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2019, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 12% of residential mortgages and 7% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due. (b) At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, $16 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. (c) Predominantly all impaired loans in the table above are in the U.S. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. (e) At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, nonaccrual loans included $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. Refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status. 128 The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Residential mortgage $ 50 $ 67 $ 181 $ 314 Home equity 100 55 214 241 Total residential real estate – excluding PCI $ 150 $ 122 $ 395 $ 555 129 Nature and extent of modifications The U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable programs, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. (b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and forbearances that meet the definition of a TDR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Forbearances suspend or reduce monthly payments for a specific period of time to address a temporary hardship. 130 Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. At September 30, 2019, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 10 years for residential mortgage and 9 years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). Active and suspended foreclosure At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $546 million and $653 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. 131 Other consumer loans The table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto and business banking loans.

This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S. (c) Other consumer average impaired loans were $254 million and $271 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $248 million and $281 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $77 million and $79 million, respectively. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were not material. TDRs on nonaccrual status were $55 million and $57 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 133 Purchased credit-impaired loans Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies.

(b) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (c) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (d) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2019. 134 Approximately 26% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

Substantially all HELOCs are beyond the revolving period. (b) Includes loans modified into fixed rate amortizing loans. The table below presents the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.

Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Average impaired credit card loans $ 1,406 $ 1,267 $ 1,371 $ 1,245 Interest income on impaired credit card loans 18 17 53 48 Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were $242 million and $215 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $717 million and $640 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information about credit card loan modifications. Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. (in millions, except weighted-average data) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 19.18% 18.25% 19.23% 17.82% Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 4.65 5.10 4.80 5.12 Loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(a) $ 42 $ 31 $ 108 $ 82 (a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 34.30% and 33.38% as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. 136 Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on these risk ratings.

This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged-off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs; interest payments received and applied to the carrying value; net deferred loan fees or costs; and unamortized discount or premiums on purchased loans.

A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool. (b) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. (c) The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses is related to loans that have been modified in a TDR; such allowance is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. 139 Note 13 – Variable interest entities Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $12.6 billion and $20.1 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $8.5 billion and $8.0 billion at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, and are reported as off- balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party, refer to pages 142–143 of this Note for further information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase’s Municipal bond vehicles. 142 Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Refer to note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for conduits program-wide credit enhancements. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $6.8 billion and $13.7 billion at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. (e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind, solar and other alternative energy projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $17.0 billion and $16.5 billion, of which $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion was unfunded at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to Customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the 143 Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to Customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $5.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, was $8.6 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations. Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

(d) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (e) Includes prime mortgages only. Excludes loan securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies. (f) Includes commercial mortgage and other consumer loans. Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. 144 The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Carrying value of loans sold $ 35,556 $ 11,968 $ 73,873 $ 28,804 Proceeds received from loan sales as cash 3 1 73 1 Proceeds from loan sales as securities(a)(b) 35,512 11,713 73,172 28,291 Total proceeds received from loan sales(c) $ 35,515 $ 11,714 $ 73,245 $ 28,292 Gains on loan sales(d)(e) $ 342 $ 9 $ 495 $ 32 (a) Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt or retained as part of the Firm’s Investment securities portfolio. (b) Included in level 2 assets. (c) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. (d) Gains on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (e) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. (in millions) Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Loans repurchased or option to repurchase(a) $ 4,761 $ 7,021 Real estate owned 50 75 Foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans(b) 241 361 (a) Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. (b) Relates to voluntary repurchases of loans, which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable. Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. Net liquidation losses(a) Securitized assets 90 days past due Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Securitized loans Residential mortgage: Prime / Alt-A & option ARMs $ 49,826 $ 50,679 $ 2,679 $ 3,354 $ 146 $ 182 $ 474 $ 453 Subprime 14,085 15,434 1,962 2,478 145 155 456 (307) Commercial and other 86,302 79,387 153 225 118 71 283 119 Total loans securitized $ 150,213 $ 145,500 $ 4,794 $ 6,057 $ 409 $ 408 $ 1,213 $ 265 (a) Includes liquidation gains as a result of private label mortgage settlement payments during the first quarter of 2018, which were reflected as asset recoveries by trustees. 145 Note 14 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights. Goodwill The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments. (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Consumer & Community Banking $ 31,038 $ 30,984 Corporate & Investment Bank 6,941 6,770 Commercial Banking 2,982 2,860 Asset & Wealth Management 6,857 6,857 Total goodwill $ 47,818 $ 47,471 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of period $ 47,477 $ 47,488 $ 47,471 $ 47,507 Changes during the period from: Business combinations(a) 348 — 348 — Other(b) (7) (5) (1) (24) Balance at September 30, $ 47,818 $ 47,483 $ 47,818 $ 47,483 (a) For the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2019, represents goodwill associated with the July 24, 2019 acquisition of InstaMed. This goodwill was allocated to CIB, CB and CCB. (b) Primarily relates to foreign currency adjustments. Goodwill impairment testing Refer to Impairment testing on pages 252–253 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test. The Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual and projections of business performance for all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or 2018. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. 146 Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Fair value at beginning of period $ 5,093 $ 6,241 $ 6,130 $ 6,030 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 390 278 1,146 611 Purchase of MSRs (2) 13 104 159 Disposition of MSRs(a) (359) (2) (687) (401) Net additions/(dispositions) 29 289 563 369 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (256) (195) (702) (542) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) (433) 150 (1,274) 635 Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) 17 14 (333) (e) 14 Discount rates — — 153 24 Prepayment model changes and other(c) (31) (66) (118) (97) Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions (14) (52) (298) (59) Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions (447) 98 (1,572) 576 Fair value at September 30, $ 4,419 $ 6,433 $ 4,419 $ 6,433 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at September 30, $ (447) $ 98 $ (1,572) $ 576 Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 397 428 1,254 1,339 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at September 30, (in billions) 537 528 537 528 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at September 30, (in billions)(d) 2.0 3.1 2.0 3.1 (a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. (e) The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates. 147 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 CCB mortgage fees and related income Net production revenue $ 738 $ 108 $ 1,291 $ 296 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 351 435 1,172 1,389 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (256) (195) (702) (542) Total operating revenue 95 240 470 847 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a) (433) 150 (1,274) 636 Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b) (14) (52) (298) (59) Change in derivative fair value and other 500 (186) 1,372 (671) Total risk management 53 (88) (200) (94) Total net mortgage servicing revenue 148 152 270 753 Total CCB mortgage fees and related income 886 260 1,561 1,049 All other 1 2 1 2 Mortgage fees and related income $ 887 $ 262 $ 1,562 $ 1,051 (a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates) Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate) 13.81% 8.78% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (206) $ (205) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (393) (397) Weighted-average option adjusted spread(a)(b) 8.26% 7.87% Impact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change $ (150) $ (235) Impact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change (289) (452) (a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital. (b) The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. 148 Note 15 – Deposits Refer to Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information on deposits. At September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows. (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 U.S. offices Noninterest-bearing (included $23,225 and $17,204 at fair value)(a)(b) $ 393,522 $ 386,709 Interest-bearing (included $2,523 and $2,487 at fair value)(a)(b) 844,137 813,881 Total deposits in U.S. offices 1,237,659 1,200,590 Non-U.S. offices Noninterest-bearing (included $2,289 and $2,367 at fair value)(a)(b) 21,455 21,459 Interest-bearing (included $1,318 and $1,159 at fair value)(a)(b) 266,147 248,617 Total deposits in non-U.S. offices 287,602 270,076 Total deposits $ 1,525,261 $ 1,470,666 (a) Includes structured notes classified as deposits for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion. (b) In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain structured notes from interest-bearing to noninterest- bearing deposits as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. This change was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation. Note 16 – Leases Lease commitments Effective January 1, 2019, the Firm adopted new guidance that requires lessees to recognize on the Consolidated balance sheets all leases with lease terms greater than twelve months as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. Accordingly, the Firm recognized operating lease liabilities and ROU assets of $8.2 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. The adoption of the new lease guidance did not have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. The change in accounting due to the adoption of the new lease guidance did not result in a material change to the future net minimum rental payments/receivables or to the net rental expense when compared to December 31, 2018. Firm as lessee At September 30, 2019, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income. 149 The following tables provide information related to the Firm’s operating leases: As of September 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2019 Right-of-use assets $ 8,160 Lease liabilities 8,425 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.7 Weighted average discount rate 3.73% Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities - operating cash flows $ 1,177 Supplemental non-cash information Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 990 (in millions) Three months ended September 30, 2019 Nine months ended September 30, 2019 Rental expense Gross rental expense $ 517 $ 1,537 Sublease rental income (49) (137) Net rental expense $ 468 $ 1,400 The following table presents future payments under operating leases as of September 30, 2019: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 (excluding nine months ended September 30, 2019) $ 394 2020 1,569 2021 1,394 2022 1,198 2023 1,027 After 2023 4,442 Total future minimum lease payments 10,024 Less: Imputed interest (1,599) Total $ 8,425 In addition to the table above, as of September 30, 2019, the Firm had additional future operating lease commitments of $1.3 billion that were signed but had not yet commenced. These operating leases will commence between 2019 and 2022 with lease terms up to 25 years. Firm as lessor The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. Generally, the Firm’s lease financings are operating leases. These assets are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income. On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees. The following table presents the carrying value of assets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance sheets: (in millions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Carrying value of assets subject to operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 22,953 $ 21,428 Accumulated depreciation 5,848 5,303 The following table presents the Firm’s operating lease income and the related depreciation expense on the Consolidated statements of income: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Operating lease income $ 1,384 $ 1,157 $ 4,027 $ 3,316 Depreciation expense 1,053 901 3,038 2,564 The following table presents future receipts under operating leases as of September 30, 2019: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 (excluding nine months ended September 30, 2019) $ 1,121 2020 3,785 2021 2,303 2022 660 2023 74 After 2023 137 Total future minimum lease payments $ 8,080 150 Note 17 - Preferred stock Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion on preferred stock.

Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s restricted cash: (in billions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Cash reserves – Federal Reserve Banks $ 26.7 $ 22.1 Segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers 16.8 14.6 Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes 3.6 4.1 Total restricted cash(a) $ 47.1 $ 40.8 (a) Comprises $45.9 billion and $39.6 billion in deposits with banks as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and $1.2 billion in cash and due from banks as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 21 – Regulatory capital Refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s insured depository institutions (“IDI”), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the fully phased-in measures under Basel III and represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table represents the minimum and well- capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of September 30, 2019. Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios BHC(a)(e)(f) IDI(b)(e)(f) BHC(c) IDI(d) Capital ratios CET1 10.5% 7.0% N/A 6.5% Tier 1 12.0 8.5 6.0 8.0 Total 14.0 10.5 10.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 4.0 N/A 5.0 SLR 5.0 6.0 N/A 6.0 Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as calculated under Method 2. (b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. (e) For the period ended December 31, 2018, the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 9.0%, 10.5%, 12.5%, and 4.0% and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries were 6.375%, 7.875%, 9.875%, and 4.0%, respectively. (f) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as, supplementary leverage buffers of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively. 155 The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending- related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. 157 Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments Contractual amount Carrying value(g) September 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 Sep 30, 2019 Dec 31, 2018 By remaining maturity (in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after 1 year through 3 years Expires after 3 years through 5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total Lending-related Consumer, excluding credit card: Home equity $ 597 $ 1,156 $ 2,353 $ 17,077 $ 21,183 $ 20,901 $ 12 $ 12 Residential mortgage(a) 10,904 — — 12 10,916 5,481 — — Auto 8,062 1,238 118 49 9,467 8,011 2 2 Consumer & Business Banking 10,324 643 106 952 12,025 11,673 19 19 Total consumer, excluding credit card 29,887 3,037 2,577 18,090 53,591 46,066 33 33 Credit card 645,880 — — — 645,880 605,379 — — Total consumer(b) 675,767 3,037 2,577 18,090 699,471 651,445 33 33 Wholesale: Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(c) 55,258 128,911 161,963 11,200 357,332 351,490 912 852 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(c) 16,373 10,525 5,349 1,842 34,089 33,498 605 521 Other letters of credit(c) 3,853 305 40 — 4,198 2,825 5 3 Total wholesale(b) 75,484 139,741 167,352 13,042 395,619 387,813 1,522 1,376 Total lending-related $ 751,251 $ 142,778 $ 169,929 $ 31,132 $ 1,095,090 $1,039,258 $ 1,555 $ 1,409 Other guarantees and commitments Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(d) $ 214,338 $ — $ — $ — $ 214,338 $ 186,077 $ — $ — Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 1,772 196 12,081 40,369 54,418 55,271 231 367 Unsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 122,946 1,125 66 — 124,137 102,008 — — Unsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 120,679 670 — — 121,349 57,732 — — Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications: Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 61 89 Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 1,001 1,019 27 30 Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments(e) 161,580 — — — 161,580 58,960 — — Other guarantees and commitments(f) 4,098 590 260 2,832 7,780 8,183 (89) (73) (a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

Additionally, includes unfunded commitments predominantly related to certain tax- oriented equity investments. (g) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative- related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. 158 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018.

Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information. The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation. 159 Sponsored member repo program In 2018 the Firm commenced the sponsored member repo program, wherein the Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 157. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 157 of this Note. Refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information. Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral. Pledged assets The Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, pledged assets are used for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets. (in billions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 154.2 $ 104.0 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 94.5 83.7 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 487.1 475.3 Total assets pledged $ 735.8 $ 663.0 Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities. Refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt. Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. (in billions) September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,264.1 $ 1,245.3 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,017.3 998.3 160 Note 24 – Litigation Contingencies As of September 30, 2019, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.3 billion at September 30, 2019. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and no trial date has been set. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX- related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. In addition, the Firm has paid fines totaling approximately $265 million in connection with the settlement of FX-related investigations conducted by the European Commission and the Swiss Competition Commission which were announced in May 2019 and June 2019, respectively. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of 161 federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018 (the “opt-out action”). The two FX-related actions brought by participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans have been dismissed. Putative class actions on behalf of consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”) and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”) remain pending in the District Court. In addition, some FX related individual and putative class actions have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia, which are based on similar alleged underlying conduct. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws. The parties settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed the settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. In March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined petitions seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement, and the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking preliminary approval of the modified settlement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants have collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In January 2019, the amended agreement was preliminarily approved by the District Court, and formal notice of the class settlement has been completed in accordance with the District Court’s order. A fairness hearing is scheduled before the District Court in November 2019. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates was submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations to the extent that they are ongoing. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These actions are in various stages of litigation. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other plaintiffs. The Firm has agreed to settle putative class 162 actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, as well as certain of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The District Court declined to grant preliminary approval to the settlement involving the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and instead dismissed the litigation after concluding that the plaintiff lacked standing. Plaintiff’s appeal of the District Court’s decision is pending. The remaining settlements are all subject to further documentation and court approval. Metals Investigations and Litigation. Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the metals markets and related conduct. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with these investigations. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019. The Firm is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver futures in violation of the Sherman Act. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. In September 2018, the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and remanded the case to the Court of Appeal. In June 2019, the Court of Appeal declined to annul the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel, and the Firm has reapplied to the Court of Cassation for a determination as to whether the Court of Appeal’s decision is consistent with the Court of Cassation’s September 2018 ruling. Any further actions in the criminal proceedings are stayed pending the outcome of that application. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense/(benefit) was $10 million and $20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $(2) million and $90 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. 163 Note 25 – Business segments The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results The following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed basis. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the assumptions and methodologies used in capital allocation are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to lines of business may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on business segment capital allocation.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 26, 2019, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2018, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. November 4, 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 166 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and payables that are currently presented as a single margin account on the balance sheet. In addition, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments and structured notes from interest-earning/bearing to noninterest-earning/bearing assets and liabilities as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

CLTV: Combined loan-to-value Collateral-dependent: A loan is considered to be collateral- dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower’s operations, income or other resources. Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions. Core loans: represents loans central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans excludes loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment 170 and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas MSR: Mortgage servicing rights NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/ (recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net interchange income includes the following components: • Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions. • Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs. • Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NM: Not meaningful Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property. OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss) OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit OTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer. OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house. OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairment 171 Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PD: Probability of default PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. PSU(s): Performance share units Receivables from customers: primarily represents prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables from brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. REO: Real estate owned Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). Revenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic, a third-party provider of investment banking competitive analysis and volume based league tables for the above noted industry products. RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity ROU assets: Right-of-use assets RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. Scored portfolio: The scored portfolio predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans and certain auto and business banking loans where credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time. The statistical analysis uses portfolio modeling, credit scoring and decision-support tools. S&P: Standard and Poors SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights SEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, 172 such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment. Shelf Deals: Shelf offerings are SEC provisions that allow issuers to register for new securities without selling the entire issuance at once. Since these issuances are filed with the SEC but are not yet priced in the market, they are not included in the league tables until the actual securities are issued. Single-name: Single reference-entities SLR: Supplementary leverage ratio SMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securities SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate SPEs: Special purpose entities Structural interest rate risk: represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm. Structured notes: Structured notes are financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates or indexes. Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. TBVPS: Tangible book value per share TCE: Tangible common equity TDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. TLAC: Total Loss Absorbing Capacity U.K.: United Kingdom Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion. U.S.: United States of America U.S. government agencies: U.S. government agencies include, but are not limited to, agencies such as Ginnie Mae and FHA, and do not include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”). In general, obligations of U.S. government agencies are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government in the event of a default. U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. U.S. GSE(s): “U.S. government-sponsored enterprises” are quasi-governmental, privately-held entities established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress to improve the flow of credit to specific sectors of the economy and provide certain essential services to the public. U.S. GSEs include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but do not include Ginnie Mae or FHA. U.S. GSE obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

Net production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell; the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans; and changes in the fair value of any residual interests held from mortgage securitizations. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans (excluding certain loans insured by U.S. government agencies) held-for-sale and changes in fair value on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option. Mortgage origination channels comprise the following: Retail: Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone.

Retail: clients include financial intermediaries and individual investors. Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance: Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and 175 hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 176 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 124–131 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls do occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2019, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II – Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 Form 10-K.

The Committee’s authority includes, but is not limited to the authority to, from time to time: (a) determine whether Offers shall be made under Section 8(a) or 8(b) of the Plan or combination thereof; (b) determine which Employees shall be Eligible Employees and which Subsidiaries shall be Designated Subsidiaries and in making such determination may exclude: • Employees who have employed less than 2 years by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary; • Employees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per week; • Employees whose customary employment is for not more than 5 months in any calendar year; • Employees who are highly compensated employees within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code; and • Employees who are employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary outside of the United States. • (c) prescribe and modify the form and provisions of the Offers and the method of delivery and acceptance; (d) decide questions that may arise with respect to the interpretation, construction or application of the Plan or any Offer; (e) amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, in accordance with the provisions of Section 20; (f) adopt and amend such administrative rules, regulations, procedures and guidelines governing the Plan and the Offers as it may deem necessary in its discretion; (g) establish all other terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to Offers, including but not limited to those relating to an Eligible Employee’s retirement, death, disability, leave of absence or any other termination of employment; and (h) establish the terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions that will apply to Eligible Employees, if any, working outside of the United States, including where necessary to comply with local laws, rules, regulations and policies. The Committee shall have the power to correct any defect, supply any omission or clarify any inconsistency in the Plan and/or in any Offer and to take such actions and make such administrative determinations that the Committee deems appropriate in its discretion. Any decision of the Committee in the administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties concerned, including the Company, its stockholders, subsidiaries and all Employees. The Committee may at any time delegate its responsibilities regarding the administration of the Plan to another committee or to one or more officers of the Company. Such delegations need not be in writing. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action or determination made with respect to the Plan, except for his or her own willful misconduct. 5. ELIGIBILITY (a) Only Eligible Employees may be granted an Offer under the Plan. (b) No Eligible Employee may accept an Offer (nor may an Offer be made) if such Eligible Employee, immediately after the Offer is made, owns stock having five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary. For this purpose, the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the stock ownership of an Eligible Employee. For these purposes, stock that may be purchased by an Eligible Employee under an outstanding Offer shall be treated as owned by the Eligible Employee. 6. COMMON STOCK (a) The stock subject to purchase pursuant to Offers shall be shares of Common Stock that have been authorized but unissued, or have been previously issued and reacquired by the Company, or both. Subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 16, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased by Eligible Employees pursuant to Offers under the Plan shall not exceed 30 million shares. (b) In the event that any Offer expires or is terminated for any reason, any shares of Common Stock that were the subject of such Offer but were not purchased may be subject to another Offer under this Plan. 7. NUMBER OF SHARES AN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE MAY PURCHASE (a) The Committee may offer to Eligible Employees an option to purchase up to a certain number of shares of Common Stock as shall have an aggregate purchase price not in excess of (i) a specified percentage (not to exceed 100%) of each Eligible Employee’s Compensation or (ii) an aggregate purchase price expressed in U.S. dollars, in each case, as determined by the Committee. (b) No Eligible Employee may purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any Offer or Offers, including those made under any qualified employee stock purchase plan of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, that would permit such Eligible Employee to purchase shares of Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) (determined at the date of grant designated in the Offer) for each calendar year in which any such Offer with such Eligible Employee is outstanding at any time. Any Offer which causes such total to exceed such limit shall be null and void to the extent of such excess. 8. OFFERS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK Offers to purchase Common Stock may be made on terms and conditions established by the Committee, subject to the limitations set forth in either Section (a) or (b) below: (a) Fixed Price Offerings. The purchase price for a share of Common Stock shall be no less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of the Offer, and each such Offer shall have a stated term, as established by the Committee, not to exceed twenty-seven (27) months. (b) Variable Price Offerings. The purchase price for a share of Common Stock shall be no less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of purchase, and each Offer shall have a stated term, as established by the Committee, not to exceed five (5) years. The foregoing shall not preclude an Offer that includes both Section (a) or (b) above, subject to the twenty-seven month limitation. 9. ELECTION TO PARTICIPATE An Eligible Employee’s acceptance of an offer to purchase shares of Common Stock shall be evidenced as specified by the Committee, including by authorizing payroll deductions. 10. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS (a) By authorizing payroll deductions by a date specified by the Committee, an Eligible Employee will have accepted the terms and conditions of the Offer and will have authorized the Company or the Designated Subsidiary, to deduct per pay period, as specified by the Eligible Employee, an amount not more than nor less than the minimum set forth in an Offer from his or her Compensation commencing on the date indicated in such Offer. Such amount shall be credited to a Plan account. Subject to rules and administrative guidelines as the Committee may establish from time to time, an Eligible Employee may decrease the amount of his or her payroll deductions during the Offering Period. (b) The Committee may specify that the funds in the Eligible Employee’s Plan account be credited with interest. 11. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE Shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan shall be paid for with the amount held in the Plan account on behalf of the Eligible Employee, including accrued interest (if any). If specified by the Committee in the Offer, an Eligible Employee may (i) provide additional funds, if necessary, to purchase the full number of shares of Common Stock specified by the Offer or (ii) use shares of Common Stock owned by the Eligible Employee for at least six (6) months to purchase the full number of shares of Common Stock specified by the Offer. 12. DATE OF PURCHASE Each Offer shall provide that the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder will be purchased on the Closing Date provided for in the Offer. If the Committee so determines, Offers also may permit the Eligible Employee to purchase shares of Common Stock thereunder at such earlier dates and on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. 13. EMPLOYEE’S PURCHASE DIRECTIONS (a) On the Closing Date, each Eligible Employee will purchase shares of Common Stock, and the amount held in the Plan account on behalf of the Eligible Employee, including any accrued interest, shall be applied to the purchase price without further authorization, but only if the Fair Market Value on the Closing Date is equal to or higher than the purchase price. If the Fair Market Value on the Closing Date is lower than the purchase price, the amount held in the Plan account on behalf of the Eligible Employee, including any accrued interest, will, as the Committee may specify, be returned to such Eligible Employee or shall be retained to be used in connection with a new Offer. (b) An Eligible Employee may purchase fewer than all of the shares covered by an Offer in the manner specified by the Committee. 14. TERMINATION OF OFFER An Eligible Employee may, at any time on or before the Closing Date, terminate an Offer in its entirety in a manner specified by the Committee. Upon such termination, the Company shall cause the amount held on behalf of such Eligible Employee in the Plan account, including any accrued interest, to be paid to such Eligible Employee and further payroll deductions shall cease within a reasonable period thereafter. 15. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT The Committee shall determine the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to an Offer in the event of an Eligible Employee’s retirement, death, disability, leave of absence or any other termination of employment. 16. RECAPITALIZATION The aggregate number, kind and class of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased by Eligible Employees pursuant to Offers, the number, kind and class of shares covered by each Offer, and the purchase price per share as established in accordance with each such Offer all may be equitably adjusted, as determined by the Committee, due to any changes in the Common Stock resulting from any stock split, combination or exchange of equity securities, merger, consolidation, re- capitalization, reorganization, divestiture or other distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to stockholders, any other subdivision or consolidation of shares or other capital adjustment, or the payment of a stock dividend or other increase or decrease in such shares. 17. ASSIGNABILITY No Offer may be assigned or transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 18. RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER An Eligible Employee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by an Offer until the date the Eligible Employee becomes the holder of record of such shares. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to such date of purchase. 19. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A OF THE CODE All Offers entered into and all transactions that occur under this Plan are intended to comply with all applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”), and, with respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the 1934 Act, with the conditions of Rule 16b-3 of the 1934 Act, and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent an Offer is subject to Section 409A, the Offer shall be granted or exercised in a manner that will comply with Section 409A, including the final regulations and other guidance issued with respect thereto, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Any provision of the Plan that would cause an Offer or the exercise thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A shall be amended to comply with Section 409A on a timely basis, which amendment may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance with the final regulations and guidance issued under Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability to an Eligible Employee or any other party if an Offer granted under the Plan that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto. 20. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION The Committee may from time to time amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in whole or in part or amend any and all Offers granted under the Plan to the extent permitted by law. However, no such action of the Committee may be taken without the approval of the Board and/or the stockholders, if Board and/or stockholder approval would be required under then applicable law. 21. TAX WITHHOLDING Any amounts to be paid or shares to be delivered to any Eligible Employee under the Plan shall be reduced by any sums required by law to be withheld by the Company for payment of taxes, unless the Committee specifies another method of satisfying such taxes. 22. GOVERNING LAW The Plan and all Offers shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York. 23. EMPLOYMENT AT WILL This document is neither a contract nor a guarantee of continued employment for any definite period of time. An Employee’s employment is always on an at-will basis.
