Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 186 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. JPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and pr ocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statemen ts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMor gan Chase's management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the F irm's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degr ee of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making the assessment, management used the framework in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission, commonly referred to as the “COSO” criteria. Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO criteria. Additionally , based upon management's assessment, the Firm determined that ther e were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. The effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their r eport which appears herein. James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marianne Lake Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 28, 2013 Report of independent registered public accounting firm JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 187 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statemen ts of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of JPMor gan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “F irm”) at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flo ws for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material r espects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the T readway Commission (COSO). The Firm’s management is responsible for these financial statemen ts, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting”. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statemen ts and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statemen ts are free of material misstatemen t and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material r espects. Our audits of the financial statemen ts included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statemen ts, assessing the accounting principles used and significan t estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statemen t presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statemen ts for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the c ompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statemen ts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statemen ts. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degr ee of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to consolidated financial statements JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 193 Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United S tates of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, see Note 33 on pages 326–329 of this Annual Report. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). Additionally , where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Firm determines whether it has a c ontrolling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). Voting Interest Entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a c ontrolling interest is primarily based on the amoun t of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected at the inception of the Firm’s investment. These investments are generally included in other assets, with inc ome or loss included in other income. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liabilit y companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member , but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these funds. In the limited cases wher e the nonaffiliated partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm consolidates the funds. The Firm’s investment companies make investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is a special purpose en tity (“SPE”). SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’ s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’ s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE . The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significan tly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the righ t to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Notes to consolidated financial statements 194 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significan tly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessmen t includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation righ ts over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivative or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization struc ture; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’ s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majorit y voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an amendment which deferred the requirements of the accounting guidance for VIEs for certain investment funds, including mutual funds, private equity funds and hedge funds. F or the funds to which the deferral applies, the Firm continues to apply other existing authoritative accounting guidance to determine whether such funds should be consolidated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, r evenue and expense denominated in non-U.S . currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”) within stockholder s’ equity. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar , are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

On March 13, 2012, the Board of Directors increased the Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend fr om $0.25 to $0.30 per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2012, to shareholders of record on April 5, 2012. Other business events RBS Sempra transaction On July 1, 2010, JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of RBS Sempra Commodities’ global oil, global metals and European power and gas businesses. The Firm acquired approximately $1.7 billion of net assets which included $3.3 billion of debt which was immediately repaid. This acquisition almost doubled the number of clien ts the Firm’s commodities business can serve and has enabled the Firm to offer clients more products in more regions of the world. Purchase of remaining interest in J.P. Morgan Cazenove On January 4, 2010, JPMorgan Chase purchased the remaining interest in J.P. Morgan Cazenove, an investment banking business partnership formed in 2005, which resulted in an adjustmen t to the Firm’s capital surplus of approximately $1.3 billion. Global settlement on servicing and origination of mortgages On February 9, 2012, the Firm announced that it had agreed to a settlement in principle (the “ global settlement”) with a number of federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the State Attorneys General, relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The global settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required the Firm to, among other things: (i) make cash payments of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of which will be set aside f or payments to borrowers (“Cash Settlement Payment”); (ii) provide approximately $500 million of refinancing relief to certain “underwater” borrowers whose loans are owned and serviced by the Firm (“Refi Program”); and (iii) provide approximately $3.7 billion of additional relief for certain borrowers, including reductions of principal on first and second liens, payments to assist with short sales, deficiency balance waivers on past foreclosures and short sales, and forbearance assistance for unemployed homeowners (“Consumer Relief Program”). The Cash Settlement Payment was made on April 13, 2012. As the Firm provides relief to borrowers under the Refi and Consumer Relief Programs, the Firm receives credits that reduce its remaining obligation under these programs. If the Firm does not meet certain targets set forth in the global settlement agreement for providing either refinancings under the Refi Program or other borrower relief under the Consumer Relief Program within certain prescribed time periods, the Firm must instead mak e additional cash payments. In general, 75% of the ta rgets must be met within two years of the date of the global set tlement and 100% must be achieved within three years of that date. The Firm filed its first quarterly report concerning its compliance with the global settlement with the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight in November 2012. The report included information regarding refinancings completed under the Refi Program and relief provided to borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program, as well as credits earned by the Firm under the global settlement as a result of such actions. The global settlement releases the Firm from certain further claims by the participating government entities related to servicing activities, includin g foreclosures and loss mitigati on activities; certain origination activities; and certain bankruptcy-related activities. Not included in the global settlement are any claims arising out of securitization activities, includin g representations made to investors with respect to mortgage-backed securities; criminal claims; and repurchase demands from U.S. government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”), among other items. Also on February 9, 2012, the Firm entered into agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) for the payment of civil money penalties related to conduct that was the subject of consent orders entered into with the ba nking regulators in April 2011. The Firm’s payment obligations under those agreements will be deemed satisfied b y the Firm’s payments and provisions of relief under the global settlement. For further information on this global set tlement, see Loans in Note 14 on pages 250–275 of this Annual Report. Washington Mutual, Inc. bankruptcy plan confirmation On February 17, 2012, a bankruptcy court confirmed the joint plan containing the global settlement agreement resolving numerous disputes among Washington Mutual, Inc. (“WMI”), JPMorgan Chase and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as well as significant creditor groups (the “WaMu Global Settlement”). The WaMu Global Settlement was finalized on March 19, 2012, pursuant to the execution of a definitiv e agreement and court approval, and the Firm recognized additional assets, including certain pension-related assets, as well as tax refunds, resulting in a pretax gain of $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2012. For additional information related to the WaMu Global Settlement see Washington Mutual Litigations in Note 31 on page 324 of this Annual Report. Notes to consolidated financial statements 196 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Superstorm Sandy On October 29, 2012, the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the U.S. were affected by Superstorm Sandy , which caused major flooding and wind damage and resulted in major disruptions to individuals and businesses and significant damage to homes and communities in the affected regions. Superstorm Sandy did not have a material impact on the 2012 financial results of the Firm. Subsequent events Mortgage foreclosure settlement agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System On January 7, 2013, the Firm announced that it and a number of other financial institutions en tered into a settlement agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System providing for the termination of the independent foreclosure review programs (the “Independent Foreclosure Review”). Under this settlement, the Firm will make a cash payment of $753 million into a settlement fund for distribution to qualified borr owers. The Firm has also committed an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure prevention actions, which will be fulfilled through credits given to the Firm for modifications, short sales and other specified types of borrower relief. Foreclosure prevention actions that earn credit under the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement are in addition to actions taken by the Firm to earn credit under the global settlement entered into by the Firm with state and federal agencies. The estimated impac t of the foreclosure prevention actions required under the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement have been considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. The Firm recognized a pretax charge of approximately $700 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. Note 3 – Fair value measurement JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities ar e predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that ar e measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets). Certain assets (e.g. certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral), liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted mark et prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on models that c onsider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturit y) and use as inputs observable or unobservable market parameters, including but not limited to yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustmen ts may be made to ensure that financial instrumen ts are recorded at fair value, as described below. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other mark et participants, the methods and assumptions used r eflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair v alue. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to those used b y the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Firm’s valuation control function, which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm has a firm-wide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) comprising senior finance and risk executives to oversee the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The VGF is chaired by the firm-wide head of the valuation control function, and also includes sub-f orums for the CIB, MB, and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. The valuation control function verifies fair value estimates leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, additional review is performed by the valuation control function to ensure the reasonableness of estimates that cannot be v erified to external independent data, and may include: evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds; benchmarking of valuation inputs to those f or similar instruments; decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components; comparing expected to actual cash flows; reviewing profit and loss trends; and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. In addition there are additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The valuation control function determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments are applied to the quoted market price for instruments classified within JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 197 level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (see below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustmen ts to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the siz e of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustmen ts follows a consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustmen ts are considered when the Firm may not be able to observe a recent market price for a financial instrumen t that trades in an inactive (or less active) market. The Firm estimates the amoun t of uncertainty in the initial fair v alue estimate based on the degree of liquidity in the market. Factors considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include: (1) the amount of time since the last relevant pricing point; (2) whether there was an actual trade or relevant external quote or alternatively pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the volatility of the principal risk component of the financial instrumen t. For certain portfolios of financial instrumen ts that the Firm manages on the basis of net open risk e xposure, valuation adjustments are necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustmen ts are based on factors including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal mark et-size. • Unobservable parameter valuation adjustmen ts may be made when positions ar e valued using internally developed models that incorporate unobservable parameters – that is, parameters that must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Unobservable parameter valuation adjustmen ts are applied to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the valuation estimate pr ovided by the model. Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustmen ts to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm’s own creditworthiness, applying a consistent framework across the Firm. For more information on such adjustmen ts see Credit adjustments on page 212 of this Note Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined usin g valuation models that consider relevant transaction data such as maturity and use as inputs mark et-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs to those models. The Firm’s Model Risk function within the Firm’s Model Risk and Development Group, which in turn reports to the Chief Risk Officer, reviews and approves valuation models used by the Firm. Model reviews consider a number of factors about the model’s suitability for valuation of a particular product including whether it accurately reflects the characteristics and significant risks of a particular instrument; the selection and reliability of model inputs; consistency with models for similar products; the appropriateness of any model-related adjustments; and sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions that cannot be obser ved from the market. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and ma y perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. New significant valuation models, as well as material changes to existing models, are reviewed and approved prior to implementation except where specified conditions are met. The Model Risk function performs an annual Firmwide model risk assessmen t where developments in the product or market are considered in determining whether valuation models which ha ve already been reviewed need to be reviewed and approved again. Valuation Hierarchy A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liabilit y as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in ac tive markets, and inputs that ar e observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrumen t. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrumen t’s categorization within the v aluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Notes to consolidated financial statements 198 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The following table describes the valuation methodologies used b y the Firm to measure its more significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instrumen ts pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Product/instrument Valuation methodology, inputs and assumptions Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Securities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Level 2 • Derivative features. For further information refer to discussion on derivatives below. • Market rates for the respective maturity • Collateral Loans and lending-related commitments - wholesale Trading portfolio Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observed market prices (circumstances are limited) • Relevant broker quotes • Observed market prices for similar instruments Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following: • Yield • Lifetime credit losses • Loss severity • Prepayment speed • Servicing costs Loans held for investment and associated lending related commitments Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 3 • Credit spreads, derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating, and which take into account the difference in loss severity rates between bonds and loans • Prepayment speed Lending related commitments are valued similar to loans and r eflect the portion of an unused commitment expected, based on the Firm’s average portfolio historical experience, to become funded prior to an obligor default For information regarding the valuation of loans measur ed at collateral value, see Note 14 on pages 250-275 of this Annual Report. Loans - consumer Held for investment consumer loans, excluding credit card Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 3 • Discount rates (derived from primary origination rates and market activity) • Expected lifetime credit losses (considering expected and current default rates for existing portfolios, collateral prices, and economic environment expectations (i.e., unemployment rates)) • Estimated prepayments • Servicing costs • Market liquidity For information regarding the valuation of loans measur ed at collateral value, see Note 14 on pages 250-275 of this Annual Report. Credit card receivables Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Level 3 • Projected interest income and late fee revenue, funding, servicing and credit costs, and loan repayment rates • Estimated life of receivables (based on projected loan payment rates) • Discount rate - based on expected return on receivables • Credit costs - allowance for loan losses is considered a reasonable proxy for the credit cost based on the short- term nature of credit card receivables Conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold Fair value is based upon observable prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar c ollateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidit y. Predominantly level 2 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 199 Product/instrument Valuation methodology, inputs and assumptions Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Securities Quoted market prices are used where available. Level 1 In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observable market prices for similar securities • Relevant broker quotes • Discounted cash flows In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products: Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity • Credit spreads • Credit rating data Physical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data Level 1 or 2 Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives that are actively traded and valued using the exchange price, and over-the-counter contracts where quoted prices are available in an active market. Level 1 Derivatives valued using models such as the Black -Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a c ombination of models, that use observable or unobservable valuation inputs (e.g. plain vanilla options and interest rate and credit default swaps). Inputs include: Level 2 or 3 • Contractual terms includin g the period to maturity • Readily observable parameters including interest rates and volatility • Credit quality of the counterparty and of the Firm • Correlation levels In addition, the following specific inputs are used for the following derivatives that are valued based on models with significan t unobservable inputs: Structured credit derivatives specific inputs include: • CDS spreads and recovery rates • Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments (levels are modeled on a transaction basis and calibrated to liquid benchmark tranche indices) • Actual transactions, where available, are used to regularly recalibrate unobservable parameters Certain long-dated equity option specific inputs include: • Long-dated equity volatilities Certain interest rate and FX exotic options specific inputs include: • Interest rate correlation • Interest rate spread volatility • Foreign exchange correlation • Correlation between interest rates and foreign exchange rates • Parameters describing the evolution of underlyin g interest rates Certain commodity derivatives specific inputs include: • Commodity volatility Adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality (credit valuation adjustments or “CVA”), and the Firms own creditworthiness (debit valuation adjustmen ts or “DVA”), see page 212 of this Note.

2011, included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $119.4 billion and $122.4 billion respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related. (b) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included within trading loans were $26.4 billion and $20.1 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the in tent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $17.4 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $4.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is a term defined in U.S . GAAP as an amount not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the v alue of the inventory. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 203 Therefore, market approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted f or changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, see Note 6 on pages 218–227 of this Annual Report. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period pr esented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not y et purchased (short positions) when the lon g and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”). (e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables abo ve, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Therefore, the balances reported in the fair value hierarchy table are gross of any counterparty netting adjustments. However, if the Firm were to net such balances within level 3, the reduction in the level 3 derivative receivable and payable balances would be $8.4 billion and $11.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively; this is exclusive of the netting benefit associated with cash c ollateral, which would further reduce the level 3 balances. (f) Private equity instruments represent investments within the Corporate/Private Equity segment. The cost basis of the private equity investment portfolio totaled $8.4 billion and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (g) Includes investments in hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds that do not ha ve readily determinable fair v alues. The Firm uses net asset value per share when measuring the fair value of these investments. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of these investments were $4.9 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, in level 2, and $3.8 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in level 3. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the year ended December 31, 2012, $113.9 billion of settled U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities were transferred from level 1 to level 2. While the U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities market remains highly liquid and tr ansparent, the transfer reflects greater market price differentiation between settled securities based on certain underlying loan specific factors. There were no significant transfers from level 2 to level 1 for the year ended December 31, 2012, and no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the year ended December 31, 2012, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $1.2 billion of derivative payables based on increased observability of certain structured equity derivatives; and $1.8 billion of long-term debt due to a decrease in valuation uncertainty of certain equity structured notes. For the year ended December 31, 2011, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $2.6 billion of long-term debt due to a decrease in valuation uncertainty of certain structured notes. All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the reporting period. During 2012 the liquidity for certain collateralized loan obligations increased and price transparency improved. Accordingly, the Firm incorporated a revised valuation model into its valuation process for CLOs to better calibrate to market data where available. The Firm began to verify fair value estimates from this model to independen t sources during the fourth quarter of 2012. Although market liquidity and price transparency have improved, CLO market prices were not yet considered materially observable and therefore CLOs remained in level 3 as of December 31, 2012. The change in the valuation process did not have a significant impact on the fair value of the Firm’s CLO positions. Notes to consolidated financial statements 204 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Level 3 valuations The Firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated usin g significant unobservable inputs (level 3). For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair v alue for individual financial instruments, see pages 196–200 of this Note. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgmen t. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significan t unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair v alue for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in derivin g valuation inputs — including, but not limited to, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Finally, management judgment must be applied to assess the appr opriate level of valuation adjustmen ts to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters, where relevant. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instrumen ts, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instrumen ts, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classif y an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instrumen ts typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table . In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instrumen ts using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input r ange does not reflect the level of input uncertainty, instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. F or example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors , or strike prices. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is bein g used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather , they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instrumen ts within the range of characteristics. The input r ange and weighted average values will therefore vary from period to period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(b) The unobservable inputs and associated input r anges for approximately $1.3 billion of credit derivative receivables and $1.2 billion of credit derivative payables with underlyin g mortgage risk have been included in the inputs and r anges provided for commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans. (c) Approximately 16% of instruments in this category include price as an unobservable input. This balance includes certain securities and illiquid tr ading loans, which are generally valued using comparable prices and/or yields for similar instrumen ts. (d) CLOs are securities backed by corporate loans. At December 31, 2012, $27.9 billion of CLOs were held in the available–for–sale (“ AFS”) securities portfolio and $2.1 billion were included in asset -backed securities held in the tr ading portfolio. Substantially all of the securities ar e rated “ AAA”, “ AA” and “ A”. The reported range of credit spreads increased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012, while the reported ranges of other unobservable parameters decreased. This was primarily due to the F irm incorporating a revised valuation model for CLOs, which uses a different combination of valuation parameters as compared with the old model. The chan ge did not have a significant impact on the fair value of the Firm’s CLO positions. (e) Long-term debt, other borrowed funds, and deposits include struc tured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instrumen ts containing embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair v alue of structured notes is predominantly based on the derivative features embedded within the instrumen ts. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) The range has not been disclosed due to the wide r ange of possible values given the diverse nature of the underlying investments. Notes to consolidated financial statements 206 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the in terrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input, and where relationships exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline). Such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual r elationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply . In addition, the following discussion provides a description of attributes of the underlyin g instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Discount rates and spreads Yield – The yield of an asset is the in terest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, w ould result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualiz ed return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrumen t. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security or CLO primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlyin g mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, loan to value ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For CLOs, credit spread reflects the market’s implied risk premium based on several factors including the subordination of the investment, the credit quality of underlying borrowers, the specific terms of the loans within the CLO structure, as well as the supply and demand of the instrument. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the oblig ation. Performance rates of underlying collateral in collateralized obligations (e.g., MBS, CLOs, etc.) Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal r epayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par . Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool-to- collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borr ower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstandin g collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlyin g collateral have high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the struc ture of the securitization itself . Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security or a CLO investment depends on a host of factors relating to the underlying obligations (i.e., mortgages or loans). For mortgages, this includes the loan-to- value ratio, the nature of the lender’s charge over the property and various other instrumen t-specific factors. For CLO investments, loss severity is driven by the characteristics of the underlying loans including the seniority of the loans and the type and amount of any security provided by the obligor . JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 207 Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables (e.g., how the change in one variable influences the change in the other). Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity and foreign exchange) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter . When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter . An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an incr ease in correlation, in isolation, w ould generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Correlation inputs between risks within the same asset class ar e generally narrower than those between underlying risks across asset classes. In addition the r anges of credit correlation inputs tend to be narrower than those affecting other asset classes. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlyin g risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly , the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3, the equity, foreign exchange and interest rate correlation inputs used in estimatin g fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the r ange presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an incr ease in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlyin g the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3, the equity and interest rate volatility inputs used in estimatin g fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the r ange presented, while commodities volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range. EBITDA multiple – EBITDA multiples refer to the input (often derived from the value of a comparable company) that is multiplied by the historic and/ or expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of a company in order to estimate the company’s value. An increase in the EBITDA multiple, in isolation, net of adjustmen ts, would result in an increase in a fair value measurement. Net asset value – Net asset value is the total value of a fund’s assets less liabilities. An incr ease in net asset value would result in an increase in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheet amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instrumen ts classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. When a determination is made to classif y a financial instrumen t within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table belo w include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instrumen ts using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 211 Level 3 analysis Consolidated Balance Sheets changes Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 4.4% of total Firm assets at December 31, 2012. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2011, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measur ed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 212 of this Annual Report. For the year ended December 31, 2012 Level 3 assets were $99.1 billion at December 31, 2012, reflecting a decrease of $14.3 billion from December 31, 2011, due to the following: • $11.8 billion decrease in gross derivative receivables, predominantly driven by a $10.6 billion decrease from the impact of tightening reference entity credit spreads and risk reductions of credit derivatives and $1.6 billion decrease due to fluctuation in foreign exchange rates; • $7.3 billion decrease in trading assets – debt and equity instruments, predominantly driven by sales and settlements of ABS, trading loans, and corporate debt securities. The decreases above are partially offset by: • $3.1 billion increase in asset-backed AFS securities, predominantly driven by purchases of CLOs. Gains and Losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 207–210 of this Annual Report. 2012 • $1.3 billion of net gains on trading assets - debt and equity instruments, largely driven by tightening of credit spreads and fluctuation in foreign exchange rates; and • $1.1 billion of net gains on derivatives, driven by $6.9 billion of net gains predominantly on interest rate lock commitments due to increased volumes and lower interest rates, partially offset by $4.5 billion of net losses on credit derivatives largely as a result of tightening of reference entity credit spreads. 2011 • $7.1 billion of losses on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report; and • $6.1 billion of net gains on derivatives, related to declining interest rates and widening of reference entity credit spreads, partially offset by losses due to fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. 2010 • $2.3 billion of losses on MSRs; For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report; and • $1.0 billion gain in private equity largely driven by gains on investments in the portfolio. Notes to consolidated financial statements 212 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Credit adjustments When determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record adjustments to the Firm’s estimates of fair value in order to reflect the counterparty credit quality and Firm’s own creditworthiness: • Credit valuation adjustmen ts (“CVA”) are taken to reflect the credit quality of a counterparty in the valuation of derivatives. CVA adjustments are necessary when the market price (or parameter) is not indicativ e of the credit quality of the counterparty. As few classes of derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, derivative positions are predominantly valued using models that use as their basis obser vable market parameters. An adjustment is necessary to reflect the credit quality of each derivative counterparty to arrive at fair value. The adjustment also takes into account contractual factors designed to reduce the Firm’s credit exposure to each counterparty, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. • Debit valuation adjustmen ts (“DVA”) are taken to reflect the credit quality of the Firm in the valuation of liabilities measur ed at fair value. The methodology to determine the adjustmen t is generally consistent with CVA and incorporates JPMorgan Chase’s credit spread as observed through the credit default swap (“CDS”) market. The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity, reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated. December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 Derivative receivables balance (net of derivatives CVA) $ 74,983 $ 92,477 Derivatives CVA(a) (4,238) (6,936) Derivative payables balance (net of derivatives DVA) 70,656 74,977 Derivatives DVA (830) (1,420) Structured notes balance (net of structured notes DVA)(b)(c) 48,112 49,229 Structured notes DVA (1,712) (2,052) (a) Derivatives CVA, gross of hedges, includes results managed by the credit portfolio and other lines of business within the C orporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”). (b) Structured notes are recorded within long-term debt, other borrowed funds or deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending upon the tenor and legal form of the note. (c) Structured notes are measured at fair value based on the Firm’s election under the fair value option. For further information on these elections, see Note 4 on pages 214–216 of this Annual Report. The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Credit adjustments: Derivative CVA(a) $ 2,698 $ (2,574) $ (665) Derivative DVA (590) 538 41 Structured notes DVA(b) (340) 899 468 (a) Derivatives CVA, gross of hedges, includes results managed by the credit portfolio and other lines of business within the CIB. (b) Structured notes are measured at fair value based on the Firm’s election under the fair value option. For further information on these elections, see Note 4 on pages 214–216 of this Annual Report. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis At December 31, 2012 and 2011, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, comprised predominantly of loans. At December 31, 2012, $667 million and $4.4 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At December 31, 2011, $369 million and $4.9 billion of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at December 31, 2012 and 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3. Of the $5.1 billion of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $4.0 billion related to residential real estate loans at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3, as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation v alues. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 22% to 66%, with a weighted average of 29%. The total change in the value of assets and liabilities f or which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, related to financial instruments held at those dates were losses of $1.6 billion, $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively; these losses were predominantly associated with loans. The chan ges reported for the year ended December 31, 2012, included the impact of charge-offs recognized on residential real estate loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as described in Note 14 on page 259 of this Annual Report. For further information about the measur ement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans wher e the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 on pages 250–275 of this Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 213 Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair v alue of certain financial instrumen ts, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair v alue. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included in the following table. However, certain financial instrumen ts and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of these disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures provided in the following table include only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s assets and liabilities. For example, the Firm has developed long-term relationships with its customer s through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this Note . Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instrumen ts that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks; deposits with banks; federal funds sold; securities pur chased under resale agreements and securities borr owed with short-dated maturities; short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable; commercial paper; federal funds purchased; securities loaned and sold under r epurchase agreements with short-dated maturities; other borr owed funds; accounts payable; and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S . GAAP requires that the fair value for deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted. The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair v alues at December 31, 2012 and 2011, of financial assets and liabilities that ar e not carried on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value (i.e. excluding financial instrumen ts which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2012, information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instrumen ts within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significan t assumptions used to estimate their fair v alue, see pages 196–200 of this Note. 2012 2011 Estimated fair value hierarchy December 31, (in billions) Carrying value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value Carrying value Estimated fair value Financial assets Cash and due from banks $ 53.7 $ 53.7 $ — $ — $ 53.7 $ 59.6 $ 59.6 Deposits with banks 121.8 114.1 7.7 — 121.8 85.3 85.3 Accrued interest and accounts receivable 60.9 — 60.3 0.6 60.9 61.5 61.5 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 272.0 — 272.0 — 272.0 213.1 213.1 Securities borrowed 108.8 — 108.8 — 108.8 127.2 127.2 Loans, net of allowance for loan losses(a) 709.3 — 26.4 685.4 711.8 694.0 693.7 Other 49.7 — 42.7 7.4 50.1 49.8 50.3 Financial liabilities Deposits $ 1,187.9 $ — $ 1,187.2 $ 1.2 $ 1,188.4 $ 1,122.9 $ 1,123.4 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 235.7 — 235.7 — 235.7 206.7 206.7 Commercial paper 55.4 — 55.4 — 55.4 51.6 51.6 Other borrowed funds 15.0 — 15.0 — 15.0 12.3 12.3 Accounts payable and other liabilities 156.5 — 153.8 2.5 156.3 166.9 166.8 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 62.0 — 57.7 4.4 62.1 64.7 64.9 Long-term debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 218.2 — 220.0 5.4 225.4 222.1 219.5 (a) Fair value is typically estimated usin g a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlyin g loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair v alue and carrying value of a financial asset or liabilit y is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’ s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; futur e loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is gener ally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see page 198 of this Note. Notes to consolidated financial statements 214 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair v alue of the Firm’s wholesale lending- related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated. 2012 2011 Estimated fair value hierarchy December 31, (in billions) Carrying value(a) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value Carrying value(a) Estimated fair value Wholesale lending-related commitments $ 0.7 $ — $ — $ 1.9 $ 1.9 $ 0.7 $ 3.4 (a) Represents the allowance for wholesale lending-related commitments. Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which are recognized at fair value at the inception of guarantees. The Firm does not estimate the fair v alue of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notic e as permitted by law. For a further discussion of the v aluation of lending-related commitments, see page 198 of this Note. Trading assets and liabilities Trading assets include debt and equit y instruments owned by JPMorgan Chase (“long” positions) that ar e held for client market-making and client-driven activities, as well as for certain risk management activities, certain loans managed on a fair value basis and for which the Firm has elected the fair value option, and physical commodities inventories that are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Trading liabilities include debt and equit y instruments that the Firm has sold to other parties but does not own (“short” positions). The Firm is obligated to purchase instruments at a future date to cover the short positions. Included in trading assets and trading liabilities are the reported receivables (unrealized gains) and payables (unrealized losses) related to derivatives. Trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of securities sold but not y et purchased (short positions) when the lon g and short positions have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures numbers (“CUSIPs”). Trading assets and liabilities – average balances Average trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.

Note 4 – Fair value option The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unr ecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value. Elections Elections were made by the Firm to: • Mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences in the measurement basis of elected instruments (for example, certain instruments elected were previously accounted for on an accrual basis) while the associated risk managemen t arrangements are accounted for on a fair value basis; • Eliminate the complexities of applying certain accounting models (e.g., hedge accounting or bifurcation accounting for hybrid instruments); and/or • Better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. Elections include the following: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis. • Securities financing arrangements with an embedded derivative and/or a maturity of greater than one year. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 215 • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument. • Certain investments that receive tax credits and other equity investments acquired as part of the Washington Mutual transaction. • Structured notes issued as part of CIB’s client-driven activities. (Structured notes are financial instrumen ts that contain embedded derivatives.) • Long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts wher e the underlying assets are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instrumen ts that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table . 2012 2011 2010 December 31, (in millions) Principal transactions Other income Total changes in fair value recorded Principal transactions Other income Total changes in fair value recorded Principal transactions Other income Total changes in fair value recorded Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 161 $ — $ 161 $ 270 $ — $ 270 $ 173 $ — $ 173 Securities borrowed 10 — 10 (61) — (61) 31 — 31 Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans 513 7 (c) 520 53 (6) (c) 47 556 (2) (c) 554 Loans reported as trading assets: Changes in instrument- specific credit risk 1,489 81 (c) 1,570 934 (174) (c) 760 1,279 (6) (c) 1,273 Other changes in fair value (183) 7,670 (c) 7,487 127 5,263 (c) 5,390 (312) 4,449 (c) 4,137 Loans: Changes in instrument-specific credit risk (14) — (14) 2 — 2 95 — 95 Other changes in fair value 676 — 676 535 — 535 90 — 90 Other assets — (339) (d) (339) (49) (19) (d) (68) — (263) (d) (263) Deposits(a) (188) — (188) (237) — (237) (564) — (564) Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements (25) — (25) (4) — (4) (29) — (29) Other borrowed funds(a) 494 — 494 2,986 — 2,986 123 — 123 Trading liabilities (41) — (41) (57) — (57) (23) — (23) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs (166) — (166) (83) — (83) (12) — (12) Other liabilities — — — (3) (5) (d) (8) (9) 8 (d) (1) Long-term debt: Changes in instrument-specific credit risk(a) (835) — (835) 927 — 927 400 — 400 Other changes in fair value(b) (1,025) — (1,025) 322 — 322 1,297 — 1,297 (a) Total changes in instrument-specific credit risk related to structured notes were $(340) million, $899 million, and $468 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These totals include adjustmen ts for structured notes classified within deposits and other borr owed funds, as well as long-term debt. (b) Structured notes are debt instruments with embedded deriv atives that are tailored to meet a client’s need. The embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Although the risk associated with the struc tured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the inc ome statement impact of such risk management instruments. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 216 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which a fair value election was made The following describes how the gains and losses included in earnings during 2012, 2011 and 2010, which were attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the chan ges in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread. • Resale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowed agreements and securities lendin g agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustmen t for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements. Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. 2012 2011 December 31, (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Loans(a) Nonaccrual loans Loans reported as trading assets $ 4,217 $ 960 $ (3,257) $ 4,875 $ 1,141 $ (3,734) Loans 116 64 (52) 820 56 (764) Subtotal 4,333 1,024 (3,309) 5,695 1,197 (4,498) All other performing loans Loans reported as trading assets 44,084 40,581 (3,503) 37,481 32,657 (4,824) Loans 2,211 2,099 (112) 2,136 1,601 (535) Total loans $ 50,628 $ 43,704 $ (6,924) $ 45,312 $ 35,455 $ (9,857) Long-term debt Principal-protected debt $ 16,541 (c) $ 16,391 $ (150) $ 19,417 (c) $ 19,890 $ 473 Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA 14,397 NA NA 14,830 NA Total long-term debt NA $ 30,788 NA NA $ 34,720 NA Long-term beneficial interests Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA $ 1,170 NA NA $ 1,250 NA Total long-term beneficial interests NA $ 1,170 NA NA $ 1,250 NA (a) There were no performing loans which were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-pr otected notes. Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturit y of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturit y, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. (c) Where the Firm issues principal-pr otected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflected as the remaining contractual principal is the final principal payment at maturity. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.5 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(75) million and $(5) million, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 217 Note 5 – Credit risk concentrations Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geogr aphic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolio to assess potential concentration risks and to obtain collateral when deemed necessary. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are evaluated primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. In the wholesale por tfolio, risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual customer basis. Managemen t of the Firm’s wholesale exposure is accomplished through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, use of master netting agreements, and collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product (e.g., option adjustable rate mortgages (“ ARMs”)), industry segment (e.g., commercial real estate) or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high loan-to-value ratios results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishin g its allowance for loan losses. Customer receivables representing primarily margin loans to prime and retail brokerage clients of $23.8 billion and $17.6 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are included in the table below. These margin loans are generally over-collateralized through a pledge of assets maintained in clients’ brokerage accounts and are subject to daily minimum collateral requirements. In the event that the collateral value decreases, a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account. If additional collateral is not provided by the client, the client’s positions may be liquidated by the Firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices, the Firm does not hold any reserves for credit impairment on these receivables as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale-r elated credit exposure by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. 2012 2011 Credit exposure On-balance sheet Off-balance sheet(c) Credit exposure On-balance sheet Off-balance sheet(c) December 31, (in millions) Loans Derivatives Loans Derivatives Total consumer, excluding credit card(a) $ 352,889 $ 292,620 $ — $ 60,156 $ 370,834 $ 308,427 $ — $ 62,307 Total credit card 661,011 127,993 — 533,018 662,893 132,277 — 530,616 Total consumer 1,013,900 420,613 — 593,174 1,033,727 440,704 — 592,923 Wholesale-related Real estate 76,198 60,740 1,084 14,374 67,594 54,684 1,155 11,755 Banks and finance companies 73,318 26,651 19,846 26,821 71,440 29,392 20,372 21,676 Healthcare 48,487 11,638 3,359 33,490 42,247 8,908 3,021 30,318 Oil and gas 42,563 14,704 2,345 25,514 35,437 10,780 3,521 21,136 State and municipal governments 41,821 7,998 5,138 28,685 41,930 7,144 6,575 28,211 Consumer products 32,778 9,151 826 22,801 29,637 9,187 1,079 19,371 Asset managers 31,474 6,220 8,390 16,864 33,465 6,182 9,458 17,825 Utilities 29,533 6,814 2,649 20,070 28,650 5,191 3,602 19,857 Retail and consumer services 25,597 7,901 429 17,267 22,891 6,353 565 15,973 Central government 21,223 1,333 11,232 8,658 17,138 623 10,813 5,702 Metals/mining 20,958 6,059 624 14,275 15,254 6,073 690 8,491 Transportation 19,827 12,763 673 6,391 16,305 10,000 947 5,358 Machinery and equipment manufacturing 18,504 6,304 592 11,608 16,498 5,111 417 10,970 Technology 18,488 3,806 1,192 13,490 17,898 4,394 1,310 12,194 Media 16,007 3,967 973 11,067 11,909 3,655 202 8,052 All other(b) 299,243 120,173 15,631 163,439 285,318 110,718 28,750 145,850 Subtotal 816,019 306,222 74,983 434,814 753,611 278,395 92,477 382,739 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 6,961 6,961 — — 4,621 4,621 — — Receivables from customers and other 23,648 — — — 17,461 — — — Total wholesale-related 846,628 313,183 74,983 434,814 $ 775,693 $ 283,016 92,477 382,739 Total exposure(d) $ 1,860,528 $ 733,796 $ 74,983 $ 1,027,988 $ 1,809,420 $ 723,720 $ 92,477 $ 975,662 (a) As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, credit exposure for total consumer , excluding credit card, includes receivables from customers of $113 million and $100 million, respectively.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 218 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 6 – Derivative instruments Derivative instruments enable end-users to modify or mitigate exposure to credit or market risks. Counterparties to a derivative contract seek to obtain risks and r ewards similar to those that could be obtained from purchasing or selling a related cash instrument without having to exchange upfront the full purchase or sales price. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Customers use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative transactions or by purchasing or selling other financial instrumen ts that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. The Firm also seeks to earn a spread between the client derivatives and offsetting positions, and from the remaining open risk positions. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages its market risk exposures using various derivative instruments. Interest rate contracts are used to minimize fluctuations in earnings that are caused by changes in interest rates. Fixed- rate assets and liabilities appr eciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly , interest income and expense increases or decreases as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities r esetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains or losses on the deriv ative instruments that are related to such assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability in earnings. The Firm generally uses interest rate swaps, forwards and futures to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with c ertain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar . As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or f orecasted revenue or expense increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the deriv ative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or f orecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities contracts are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Also in the commodities portfolio, electricity and natural gas futures and forwards contracts are used to manage price risk associated with ener gy-related tolling and load- serving contracts and investments. The Firm uses credit derivatives to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lendin g- related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see the discussion in the Cr edit derivatives section on pages 226–227 of this Note. For more information about risk managemen t derivatives, see the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 224 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 222–224 of this Note . Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives are required to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the r elated cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the tr ansaction has been designated and qualifies f or hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges ar e reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 220–227 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. For further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes, see Notes 3 and 4 on pages 196–214 and 214–216, respectively, of this Annual Report. Derivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge ac counting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased credit default swaps used to manage the credit risk of loans and lendin g-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the e xposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 219 prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as r egression analysis, as well as nonstatistical methods includin g dollar- value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documen ted at least quarterly. Any hedge ineffectiveness (i.e., the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated deriv ative instrument does not exactly offset the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk) must be reported in current-period earnings. If it is determined that a deriv ative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustmen t to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and for interest-bearing instruments is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net in terest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and f oreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in OCI and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily in terest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the v alue of the derivative recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“ AOCI”) is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that ar e discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses foreign currency hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar . For foreign currency qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in the translation adjustmen ts account within AOCI. The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosur e category.

For more information on volumes and types of credit derivative contracts, see the Credit derivatives discussion on pages 226–227 of this Note. (b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts. While the notional amoun ts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments. Synthetic credit portfolio The synthetic credit portfolio is a portfolio of index credit derivatives, including short and long positions, that was held by CIO. On July 2, 2012, CIO transferred the synthetic credit portfolio, other than a portion that aggregated to a notional amount of approximately $12 billion, to CIB. The positions making up the portion of the synthetic credit portfolio retained by CIO on July 2, 2012, were effectively closed out during the third quarter of 2012.

Gains and losses w ere recorded in net interest income. The current presentation excludes accrued interest. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to chan ges in foreign currency rates, were recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (c) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (d) Included $(3.1) billion, $4.9 billion and $278 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of revenue related to certain foreign exchange trading derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. (e) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated deriv ative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk . (f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time values. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 223 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gains and losses w ere recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily net in terest income, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. (c) The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. In 2010, the Firm reclassified a $25 million loss from AOCI to earnings because the Firm determined that it w as probable that forecasted interest payment cash flows related to certain wholesale deposits w ould not occur. (d) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulativ e gain or loss on the designated deriv ative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk . Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $32 million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2012, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 8 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities. Notes to consolidated financial statements 224 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Net investment hedge gains and losses The following tables present hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pr etax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) 2012 2011 2010 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Excluded components recorded directly in income(a) Effective portion recorded in OCI Excluded components recorded directly in income(a) Effective portion recorded in OCI Excluded components recorded directly in income(a) Effective portion recorded in OCI Contract type Foreign exchange derivatives $ (306) $ (82) $ (251) $ 225 $ (139) $ (30) Foreign currency denominated debt — — — 1 — 41 Total $ (306) $ (82) $ (251) $ 226 $ (139) $ 11 (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on chan ges in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during 2012, 2011 and 2010. Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes The following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of deriv atives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that ar e used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lendin g exposures, AFS securities, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities related contracts and investments. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 5,353 $ 8,084 $ 4,987 Credit(b) (175) (52) (237) Foreign exchange(c) 47 (157) (64) Commodity(d) 94 41 (48) Total $ 5,319 $ 7,916 $ 4,638 (a) Primarily relates to interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risks associated with the mor tgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRs. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and sin gle- name credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk arising from certain AFS securities. These deriv atives do not include the synthetic credit portfolio or credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, both of which are included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other deriv atives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to hedges of the foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated liabilities. Gains and losses w ere recorded in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Primarily relates to commodity derivatives used to mitigate energy price risk associated with ener gy-related contracts and investments. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions fr om the Firm’s market-making activities, includin g the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives (including the synthetic credit portfolio) that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk managemen t categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 7 on pages 228–229 of this Annual Report for information on principal tr ansactions revenue. Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features In addition to the specific mark et risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that deriv ative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk. The amount of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 225 While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries ’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a downgrade and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal c ourse of business at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Derivative payables containing downgrade triggers December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables(a) $ 40,844 $ 39,316 Collateral posted(a) 34,414 31,473 (a) The current period presentation excludes contracts with downgrade triggers that were in a net receivable position. Prior period amoun ts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“ JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at December 31, 2012 and 2011, related to derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be trig gered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a do wngrade below the lowest current rating provided by major rating agencies. Liquidity impact of derivative downgrade triggers 2012 2011 December 31, (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Additional portion of net derivative payable to be posted as collateral upon downgrade $ 1,012 $ 1,664 $ 1,460 $ 2,054 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(a) 857 1,270 1,054 1,923 (a) Amounts represent fair value of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. The following tables show the carrying value of derivative receivables and payables after netting adjustments, and adjustments for collateral held (including cash, U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds) and transferred as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Impact of netting adjustments on derivative receivables and payables Derivative receivables Derivative payables December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Gross derivative fair value $ 1,662,380 $ 1,884,499 $ 1,639,558 $ 1,837,256 Netting adjustment – offsetting receivables/payables(a) (1,508,244) (1,710,523) (1,508,244) (1,710,523) Netting adjustment – cash collateral received/paid(a) (79,153) (81,499) (60,658) (51,756) Carrying value on Consolidated Balance Sheets $ 74,983 $ 92,477 $ 70,656 $ 74,977 Total derivative collateral Collateral held Collateral transferred December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2012 2011 Netting adjustment for cash collateral(a) $ 79,153 $ 81,499 $ 60,658 $ 51,756 Liquid securities and other cash collateral(b) 13,658 21,807 21,767 19,439 Additional liquid securities and cash collateral(c) 22,562 17,613 9,635 10,824 Total collateral for derivative transactions $ 115,373 $ 120,919 $ 92,060 $ 82,019 (a) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. (b) Represents cash collateral received and paid that is not subjec t to a legally enforceable master netting agreement, and liquid securities collateral held and transferred. (c) Represents liquid securities and cash c ollateral held and transferred at the initiation of deriv ative transactions, which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair v alue of the transactions move, as well as collateral held and transferred related to contracts that have non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted, and collateral that the Firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. These amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the tables above, because, at an individual counterparty level, the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. Notes to consolidated financial statements 226 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instrumen ts whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlyin g instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user , the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lendin g exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and to manage the cr edit risk arising from certain AFS securities and from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. For more information on the synthetic credit portfolio, see the discussion on page 220 of this Note . Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. Credit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are OTC derivative contracts. Single- name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the br oader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index comprises a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a ne w underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrumen t of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a referenced entity. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. For a further discussion of credit-related notes, see Note 16 on pages 280–291 of this Annual Report. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlyin g reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 227 The Firm does not use notional amoun ts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such deriv atives.

(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional and fair v alue amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 228 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 7 – Noninterest revenue Investment banking fees This revenue category includes advisory and equity and debt underwriting fees. Underwriting fees are recognized as revenue when the Firm has rendered all services to the issuer and is entitled to collect the fee from the issuer , as long as there are no other contingencies associated with the fee. Underwriting fees are net of syndicate expense; the Firm recognizes credit arrangement and syndication fees as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed and the fee has been earned. The following table presents the components of investment banking fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Underwriting Equity $ 1,026 $ 1,181 $ 1,589 Debt 3,290 2,934 3,172 Total underwriting 4,316 4,115 4,761 Advisory 1,492 1,796 1,429 Total investment banking fees $ 5,808 $ 5,911 $ 6,190 Principal transactions Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instrumen ts, private equity investments, and physical commodities used in mark et-making and client- driven activities. In addition, principal tr ansactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk managemen t activities disclosed separately in Note 6, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair v alue hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk managemen t purposes, primarily to mitig ate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk but as to which qualifying hedge accounting is not applied, and (c) certain derivatives related to market-making activities and other. See Note 6 on pages 218–227 of this Annual Report for information on the income statement classification of gains and losses on derivatives. The following table presents principal transactions revenue by major underlying type of risk exposures. This table does not include other types of revenue, such as net interest income on trading assets, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Trading revenue by risk exposure Interest rate(a) $ 3,922 $ (873) $ (199) Credit(b) (5,460) 3,393 4,543 Foreign exchange 1,436 1,154 1,896 Equity 2,504 2,401 2,275 Commodity(c) 2,363 2,823 889 Total trading revenue 4,765 8,898 9,404 Private equity gains/(losses)(d) 771 1,107 1,490 Principal transactions(e) $ 5,536 $ 10,005 $ 10,894 (a) Includes a pretax gain of $665 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, reflecting the recovery on a Bear Stearns-related subordinated loan. (b) Includes $5.8 billion of losses incurred by CIO from the synthetic credit portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and $449 million of losses incurred by CIO from the retained index credit derivative positions for the three months ended September 30, 2012; and losses incurr ed by CIB from the synthetic credit portfolio. (c) Includes realized gains and losses and unrealized losses on physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value), subject to any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, and gains and losses on commodity derivatives and other financial instruments that are carried at fair value through income. Commodity derivatives are frequently used to manage the Firm’s risk exposure to its physical commodities inventories. Gains/(losses) r elated to commodity fair value hedges were $(1.4) billion, $(1.1) billion and $528 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (d) Includes revenue on private equity investments held in the Private Equity business within Corporate/Private Equity, as well as those held in other business segments. (e) Principal transactions revenue included DVA related to structured notes and derivative liabilities measur ed at fair value in CIB. DVA gains/(losses) were $(930) million, $1.4 billion, and $509 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Lending- and deposit-related fees This revenue category includes fees from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, deposit-related fees in lieu of compensating balances, cash management-related activities or transactions, deposit accounts and other loan-servicing activities. These fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 229 Asset management, administration and commissions This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services, insurance premiums and commissions, and other products. These fees are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Performance-based fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets, are accrued and recognized at the end of the performance period in which the target is met. The following table presents components of asset management, administration and commissions. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Asset management Investment management fees $ 6,309 $ 6,085 $ 5,632 All other asset management fees 792 605 496 Total asset management fees 7,101 6,690 6,128 Total administration fees(a) 2,135 2,171 2,023 Commission and other fees Brokerage commissions 2,331 2,753 2,804 All other commissions and fees 2,301 2,480 2,544 Total commissions and fees 4,632 5,233 5,348 Total asset management, administration and commissions $ 13,868 $ 14,094 $ 13,499 (a) Includes fees for custody , securities lending, funds services and securities clearance. Mortgage fees and related income This revenue category primarily reflects CCB’s Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing revenue, including: fees and income derived from mortgages originated with the intent to sell; mortgage sales and servicing including losses related to the repurchase of previously-sold loans; the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRs; and r evenue related to any residual interests held from mortgage securitizations. This r evenue category also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments for mortgage loans held-for-sale, as well as changes in fair value for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of CCB mortgage servicing rights are reported in mortgage fees and related income. Net interest income from mortgage loans, and securities gains and losses on AFS securities used in mortgage-related risk management activities, are recorded in interest income and securities gains/(losses), respectively. For a further discussion of MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report. Card income This revenue category includes interchange income from credit and debit cards and net fees earned from processing credit card transactions for merchants. Card income is recognized as earned. Annual fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized on a straight- line basis over a 12-month period. Expense related to rewards programs is recorded when the rewards are earned by the customer and netted against interchange income. Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous affinity organizations and co-brand partners (collectively, “partners”), which grant the Firm exclusive rights to market to the members or customers of such partners. These partners endorse the credit card programs and provide their mailing lists to the Firm, and they may also conduct marketing activities and provide awards under the various credit card programs. The terms of these agreements generally range from three to 10 years. The Firm typically makes incentive payments to the partners based on new account originations, charge volumes and the cost of the partners’ marketing activities and awards. Payments based on new account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs. Payments to partners based on charge volumes are deducted from interchange income as the related revenue is earned. Payments based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as noninterest expense. Other income Included in other income is operating lease income of $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $971 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 230 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 8 – Interest income and Interest expense Interest income and interest expense is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and classified based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability. Interest income and interest expense includes the curr ent-period interest accruals for financial instrumen ts measured at fair value, except for financial instrumen ts containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instrumen ts that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Interest income Loans $ 35,832 $ 37,098 $ 40,388 Securities 7,939 9,215 9,540 Trading assets 9,039 11,142 11,007 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 2,442 2,523 1,786 Securities borrowed (3) (c) 110 175 Deposits with banks 555 599 345 Other assets(a) 259 606 541 Total interest income 56,063 61,293 63,782 Interest expense Interest-bearing deposits 2,655 3,855 3,424 Short-term and other liabilities(b) 1,788 2,873 2,364 Long-term debt 6,062 6,109 5,848 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 648 767 1,145 Total interest expense 11,153 13,604 12,781 Net interest income 44,910 47,689 51,001 Provision for credit losses 3,385 7,574 16,639 Net interest income after provision for credit losses $ 41,525 $ 40,115 $ 34,362 (a) Largely margin loans. (b) Includes brokerage customer payables. (c) Negative interest income for the year ended December 31, 2012, is a result of increased client-driven demand for certain securities combined with the impact of low interest rates; the offset of this matched book activity is reflected as lower net interest expense reported within short-term and other liabilities. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 231 Note 9 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans The Firm’s defined benefit pension plans and its other postretirement employee benefit (“OPEB”) plans (collectively the “Plans”) are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP for retirement benefits. Defined benefit pension plans The Firm has a qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit pension plan that pr ovides benefits to substan tially all U.S. employees. The U.S. plan employs a cash balance formula in the form of pay and interest credits to determine the benefits to be provided at retirement, based on eligible compensation and years of service. Employees begin to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of service, and benefits generally vest after three years of service. The Firm also offers benefits through defined benefit pension plans to qualifying employees in certain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/ or years of service. It is the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in amoun ts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate at this time an y contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2013. The 2013 contributions to the non-U.S . defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $40 million of which $36 million are contractually required. JPMorgan Chase also has a number of defined benefit pension plans that are not subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The most significant of these plans is the Ex cess Retirement Plan, pursuant to which certain employees previously earned pay credits on compensation amounts above the maximum stipulated by law under a qualified plan; no further pay credits are allocated under this plan. The Ex cess Retirement Plan had an unfunded projected benefit obligation in the amount of $276 million and $272 million, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Effective March 19, 2012, pursuant to the WaMu Global Settlement, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. became the sponsor of the WaMu Pension Plan. This plan ’s assets were merged with and into the JPMorgan Chase Retirement Plan effective as of December 31, 2012. Defined contribution plans JPMorgan Chase currently provides two qualified defined contribution plans in the U.S . and other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations, all of which ar e administered in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The most significan t of these plans is The JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (the “401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. The 401(k) Savings Plan allows employees to make pretax and Roth 401(k) contributions to tax -deferred investment portfolios. The JPMorgan Chase Common Stock Fund, which is an investment option under the 401(k) Savings Plan, is a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan. The Firm matches eligible emplo yee contributions up to 5% of benefits-eligible compensation (e.g., base pay) on an annual basis. Employees begin to receive matching contributions after completing a one-year-of-service requirement. Employees with total annual cash compensation of $250,000 or more are not eligible for matching contributions. Matchin g contributions vest after three years of service for employees hired on or after May 1, 2009. The 401(k) Savings Plan also permits discretionary profit-sharing contributions by participating companies for certain employees, subject to a specified vesting schedule. OPEB plans JPMorgan Chase offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and postretirement medical benefits to qualifying U.S. employees. These benefits vary with the length of service and the date of hire and provide for limits on the Firm’s share of covered medical benefits. The medical and lif e insurance benefits are both contributory. Postretirement medical benefits also are offered to qualifying U.K. employees. JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. OPEB obligation is funded with corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) ma y be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. The U.K. OPEB plan is unfunded.

(b) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $418 million and $426 million, respectively, of U.S. plan assets included participation rights under participating annuity contracts. (c) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, defined benefit pension plan amoun ts not measured at fair value included $137 million and $50 million, respectively, of accrued receivables, and $310 million and $245 million, respectively, of accrued liabilities, for U.S. plans; and $47 million and $56 million, respectively, of accrued receivables, and $46 million and $69 million of accrued liabilities, respectively, for non-U.S. plans. (d) Does not include any amounts attributable to the W aMu Pension Plan. (e) Includes an unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $31 million and $33 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the U.K. plan. Gains and losses For the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans, fair v alue is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan par ticipants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan is curr ently nine years. In addition, prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan when the prior service cost is first recognized. The average remaining amortization period for current prior service costs is six years. For the Firm’s OPEB plans, a calculated v alue that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. This value is referred to as the market related value of assets. Amortization of net gains and losses, adjusted f or gains and losses not yet recognized, is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market related value of assets. Any excess is amortized over the average future service period, which is currently four years; however, prior service costs are amortized over the average years of service remaining to full eligibility age, which is currently three years.

U.S. Non-U.S. Year ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Actual rate of return: Defined benefit pension plans 12.66% 0.72% 12.23% 7.21 - 11.72% (4.29)-13.12% 0.77-10.65% OPEB plans 10.10 5.22 11.23 NA NA NA Plan assumptions JPMorgan Chase’s expected long-term rate of return for U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan assets is a blended average of the investment advisor’s projected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the various asset classes, weighted by the asset allocation. R eturns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical r eturns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spr ead (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields. Other asset -class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. Consideration is also given to current market conditions and the short- term portfolio mix of each plan; as a result, in 2012 the Firm generally maintained the same expected return on assets as in the prior year. For the U.K. defined benefit pension plans, which r epresent the most significant of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, procedures similar to those in the U.S . are used to develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. The e xpected long-term rate of return on U.K. plan assets is an a verage of projected long-term returns for each asset class. The return on equities has been selected by reference to the yield on long-term U.K. government bonds plus an equity risk premium above the risk-free rate. The expected return on “ AA” rated long-term corporate bonds is based on an implied yield for similar bonds. The discount rate used in determinin g the benefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans w as selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows; such portfolios are derived from a broad-based universe of high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. In years in which these hypothetical bond portfolios generate excess cash, such excess is assumed to be reinvested at the one-year forward rates implied by the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve published as of the measur ement date. The discount rate for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan r epresents a rate implied from the yield curve of the year-end iBoxx £ corporate “ AA” 15-year-plus bond index.

The 2013 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets and U.S . OPEB plan assets are 7.50% and 6.25%, respectively, unchanged from 2012. For 2013, the initial health car e benefit obligation trend assumption has been set at 7.00%, and the ultimate health car e trend assumption and the year to reach the ultimate rate remains at 5.00% and 2017, respectively, unchanged from 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the interest crediting rate assumption and the assumed r ate of compensation increase remained at 5.00% and 4.00%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense is sensitive to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the disc ount rate. With all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets would result in an increase of approximately an aggregate $35 million in 2013 U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense. A 25-basis point decline in the discount rate for the U.S. plans would result in an increase in 2013 U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan e xpense of approximately an aggregate $19 million and an increase in the related benefit obligations of approximately an aggregate $272 million. A 25-basis point decrease in the interest crediting rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan would result in a decrease in 2013 U.S. defined benefit pension expense of approximately $25 million and a decrease in the related projected benefit obligations of approximately $116 million. A 25-basis point decline in the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans would result in an increase in the 2013 non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense of approximately $14 million. Investment strategy and asset allocation The Firm’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets ar e held in trust and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities, real estate, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments (e.g., hedge funds, private equity, real estate and real assets). Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets ar e held in various trusts and are also invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securities. Assets of the Firm’s COLI policies, which are used to partially fund the U.S. OPEB plan, are held in separate accounts with an insurance company and are invested in equity and fixed income index funds. The investment policy for the Firm’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets is to optimiz e the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals usin g a global portfolio of various asset classes div ersified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer . Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. Periodically the Firm performs a comprehensive analysis on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan asset allocations, inc orporating projected asset and liability data, which focuses on the short- and long-term impact of the asset allocation on cumulativ e pension expense, economic cost, present value of contributions and funded status. Currently, approved asset allocation ranges are: U.S. equity 15% to 35%, international equity 15% to 25%, debt securities 10% to 30%, hedge funds 10% to 30%, and real estate, real assets and private equity 5% to 20%. Asset allocations are not managed to a specific tar get but seek to shift asset class allocations within these stated ranges. Investment strategies incorporate the economic outlook and the anticipated implications of the macroeconomic environment on the various asset classes while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity for the plan. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and Notes to consolidated financial statements 236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report asset managers, as well as other factors that impact the portfolio, which is rebalanced when deemed necessary. For the U.K. defined benefit pension plans, which r epresent the most significant of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the assets are invested to maximize returns subject to an appropriate level of risk relative to the plans’ liabilities. In order to reduce the volatility in returns relative to the plans’ liability profiles, the U.K. defined benefit pension plans’ largest asset allocations ar e to debt securities of appropriate durations. Other assets, mainly equity securities, are then invested for capital appreciation, to provide long-term investment growth. Similar to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, asset allocations and asset managers for the U.K. plans are reviewed regularly and the portfolio is rebalanced when deemed necessary. Investments held by the Plans include financial instrumen ts which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investment instruments. Additionally , the investments in each of the common/collective trust funds and registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instrumen ts. As of December 31, 2012, assets held by the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include JPMor gan Chase common stock, except in connection with investments in third-party stock-index funds. The plans hold investments in funds that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion for U.S. plans and $220 million and $194 million for non-U.S. plans, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation of the fair v alues of total plan assets at Dec ember 31 for the years indicated, as well as the respective approved range/target allocation by asset category, for the Firm’s U.S. and non- U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

Under the terms of the L TIP , as of December 31, 2012, 283 million shares of common stock are available for issuance through May 2015. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting stock-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the L TIP , plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “L TI Plans,” and such plans c onstitute the Firm’s stock-based incentive plans. Restricted stock units (“RSUs ”) are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. RSUs are generally granted annually and generally vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and convert into shares of common stock at the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-car eer eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination, subject to post-employment and other restrictions based on age or service-related requirements. All of these awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation prior to vesting under certain specified circumstances. RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlyin g common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding and, as such, are considered participating securities as discussed in Note 24 on page 301 of this Annual Report. Under the L TI Plans, stock options and stock appr eciation rights (“SARs”) have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. The Firm typically awards SARs to certain key employees once per year; the Firm also periodically grants employee stock options and SARs to individual employees. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 grants of SARs to key employees vest ratably over five years (i.e., 20% per year) and contain clawback provisions similar to RSUs. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 grants of SARs contain full-career eligibility provisions. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight- line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without givin g consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the emplo yee’s full- career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee stock-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Firm settled all of its employee stock-based awards by issuing treasury shares. In January 2008, the Firm awarded to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer up to 2 million SARs. The terms of this award are distinct from, and more restrictive than, other equity grants regularly awarded by the Firm. Effective January 2013, the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors determined that, while all the requirements for vesting of these awards have been met, vesting should be deferred for a period of up to 18 months (i.e., up to July 22, 2014), to enable the Firm to make progress against the Firm’s strategic priorities and performance goals, including remediation relating to the CIO matter. The SARs, which have a 10-year term, will become exercisable no earlier than July 22, 2014, and have an exercise price of $39.83 (the price of JPMorgan Chase common stock on the date of grant). Vesting will be subject to a Board determination taking into consideration the extent of such progress and such other factors as it deems relevant. The expense related to this award is dependent on changes in fair value of the SARs through the date at which the award is finalized, and the cumulative expense is recognized ratably over the service period, which was initially assumed to be fiv e years but, effective in the first quarter of 2013, has been extended to six and one-half years. The Firm recognized $5 million, $(4) million and $4 million in compensation expense in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for this award. Notes to consolidated financial statements 242 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report RSUs, employee stock options and SARs activity Compensation expense for RSUs is measured based on the number of shar es granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for employee stock options and SARs, is measur ed at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously . The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, employee stock options and SARs activity for 2012. RSUs Options/SARs Year ended December 31, 2012 Number of shares Weighted- average grant date fair value Number of awards Weighted- average exercise price Weighted- average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in thousands, except weighted-average data, and where otherwise stated) Outstanding, January 1 166,631 $ 37.65 155,761 $ 40.58 Granted 59,646 35.73 14,738 35.70 Exercised or vested (79,062) 30.91 (18,675) 26.45 Forfeited (5,209) 40.22 (3,888) 38.07 Canceled NA NA (32,030) 40.10 Outstanding, December 31 142,006 $ 40.49 115,906 $ 42.44 5.5 $ 721,059 Exercisable, December 31 NA NA 70,576 45.87 4.2 420,713 The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $2.8 billion, $5.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. The weighted-average grant date per share fair value of stock options and SARs gr anted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $8.89, $13.04 and $12.27, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $283 million, $191 million and $154 million, respectively. Compensation expense The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Cost of prior grants of RSUs and SARs that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 1,810 $ 1,986 $ 2,479 Accrual of estimated costs of RSUs and SARs to be granted in future periods including those to full-career eligible employees 735 689 772 Total noncash compensation expense related to employee stock-based incentive plans $ 2,545 $ 2,675 $ 3,251 At December 31, 2012, approximately $909 million (pretax) of compensation cost related to unvested awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 0.9 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards to employees. Cash flows and tax benefits Income tax benefits related to stock-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, were $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The following table sets forth the cash received from the exercise of stock options under all stock -based incentive arrangements, and the actual income tax benefit realized related to tax deductions from the exercise of the stock options. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Cash received for options exercised $ 333 $ 354 $ 205 Tax benefit realized(a) 53 31 14 (a) The tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equiv alents paid on equity- classified share-based payment awards that are charged to retained earnings are recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on shar e-based payment awards. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 243 Valuation assumptions The following table presents the assumptions used to v alue employee stock options and SARs gr anted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, under the Black-Scholes valuation model. Year ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Weighted-average annualized valuation assumptions Risk-free interest rate 1.19% 2.58% 3.89% Expected dividend yield(a) 3.15 2.20 3.13 Expected common stock price volatility 35 34 37 Expected life (in years) 6.6 6.5 6.4 (a) In 2012 and 2011, the expected dividend yield was determined using forward- looking assumptions. In 2010 the expected dividend yield was determined using historical dividend yields. The expected volatility assumption is deriv ed from the implied volatility of JPMorgan Chase’s stock options.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 244 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 12 – Securities Securities are primarily classified as AF S or trading. Securities classified as tr ading assets are discussed in Note 3 on pages 196–214 of this Annual Report. Predominantly all of the AFS securities portfolio is held by CIO in connection with its asset -liability management objectives. At December 31, 2012, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the AFS portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon in ternal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’ s). AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments, are reported as net increases or decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The specific identification method is used to determine r ealized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in securities gains/ (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other-than-temporary impairment AFS debt and equity securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed as part of the Firm’s ongoing assessment of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). For most types of debt securities, the Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary when the Firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. For beneficial interests in securitizations that ar e rated below “ AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm considers an OTTI to have occurred when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. For AFS equity securities, the Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary if it is probable that the Firm will not recover its amortized cost basis. Potential OTTI is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlyin g collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and the Firm’s intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. For debt securities, the Firm recognizes OTTI losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In these circumstances the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities. When the F irm has the intent and ability to hold AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, it evaluates the expected cash flows to be received and determines if a credit loss exists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the cr edit loss is recognized in income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in OCI. The Firm’s cash flow evaluations take into account the factors noted above and expectations of relevant market and economic data as of the end of the r eporting period. For securities issued in a securitization, the F irm estimates cash flows considering underlying loan-level data and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these f eatures are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a cr edit loss exists. The Firm also performs other analyses to support its cash flow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios. For equity securities, OTTI losses are recognized in earnings if the Firm intends to sell the security. In other cases the Firm considers the relevant factors noted above, as well as the Firm’s intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and whether evidence exists to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value. Any impairment loss on an equity security is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. Realized gains and losses The following table presents realized gains and losses and credit losses that were recognized in income from AFS securities.

(b) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, w eighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal pr epayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities ma y differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. (c) Includes securities with no stated maturit y. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated duration, which reflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in the market, is approximately three years for agency residential mortgage-backed securities, two years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and four years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 249 Note 13 – Securities financing activities JPMorgan Chase enters into resale agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions (collectively, “securities financin g agreements”) primarily to financ e the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions, accommodate customers’ financing needs, and settle other securities obligations. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Securities borrowed and securities loaned tr ansactions are generally carried at the amoun t of cash collateral advanced or received. Where appropriate under applicable ac counting guidance, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financin g agreements are recorded in interest income and interest expense, respectively. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financin g agreements. For further information regarding the fair value option, see Note 4 on pages 214– 216 of this Annual Report. The securities financin g agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities pur chased under resale agreements; securities loaned or sold under r epurchase agreements; and securities borr owed on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instrumen ts containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. The following table details the Firm’s securities financin g agreements, all of which are accounted for as collateralized financings during the periods presented. December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 Securities purchased under resale agreements(a) $ 295,413 $ 235,000 Securities borrowed(b) 119,017 142,462 Securities sold under repurchase agreements(c) $ 215,560 $ 197,789 Securities loaned(d) 23,582 14,214 (a) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included resale agreements of $24.3 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively, accounted for at fair value. (b) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included securities borr owed of $10.2 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively, accounted for at fair value. (c) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included repurchase agreements of $3.9 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, accounted for at fair value. (d) At December 31, 2012, included securities loaned of $457 million accounted for at fair value. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2011. The amounts reported in the table above were reduced by $96.9 billion and $115.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, as a result of agreements in effect that meet the specified conditions for net presentation under applicable accounting guidance. JPMorgan Chase’s policy is to take possession, where possible, of securities purchased under resale agreements and of securities borrowed. The Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (primarily G7 go vernment securities, U.S. agency securities and agency MBS, and equities) that it has r eceived from its counterparties and either requests additional collateral or returns a portion of the collateral when appropriate in light of the market value of the underlying securities. Margin levels are established initially based upon the c ounterparty and type of collateral and monitored on an ongoing basis to protect against declines in collateral value in the event of default. JPMorgan Chase typically enters into master netting agreements and other collateral arrangements with its resale agreement and securities borrowed counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the purchased or borrowed securities in the event of a customer default. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices with respect to resale and securities borrowed agreements as described above, the Firm did not hold any reserves for credit impairment with respect to these agreements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financin g agreements, see Note 30 on pages 315–316 of this Annual Report. Notes to consolidated financial statements 250 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 14 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan w as credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than pur chased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value • PCI loans held-for-investment The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories: Loans held-for-investment (other than PCI loans) Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, are measured at the principal amoun t outstanding, net of the following: allowance for loan losses; net charge-offs; interest applied to principal (f or loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Interest income Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is in doubt, which for consumer loans, excluding credit card, is generally determined when principal or in terest is 90 days or more past due and collateral, if any, is insufficient to cover principal and interest. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum pa yment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or f or certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Consumer , excluding credit card, loans that are less than 90 days past due may be placed on nonaccrual status when there is evidence that full payment of principal and interest is in doubt (e.g., performing junior liens that are subordinate to nonperforming senior liens). Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this polic y typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or , if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. However, the Firm separately establishes an allo wance for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income on credit card loans. The allowance is established with a char ge to interest income and is reported as an offset to loans. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable losses on held-for-investment loans. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 15 on pages 276–279 of this Annual Report for further information on the Firm’s accounting polices for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans, other than risk -rated business bankin g, risk-rated auto and PCI loans, are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”). Residential real estate loans, non-modified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off at 180 days past due. In the second quarter of 2012, the Firm revised its policy to charge-off modified credit card loans that do not comply with their modified pa yment terms at 120 days past due rather than 180 days past due. Auto and student loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 251 Certain consumer loans will be char ged off earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: • A charge-off is recognized when a loan is modified in a TDR if the loan is determined to be c ollateral-dependent. A loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower’s operations, income or other resources. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event (e.g., bankruptcy) that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards. Residential real estate and auto loans are charged off when the loan becomes 60 days past due, or sooner if the loan is determined to be collateral-dependent. Credit card and scored business banking loans are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of the bankruptc y filing or other event. Student loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes 60 days past due after receiving notification of a bankruptc y. • Auto loans are written down to net realizable value upon repossession of the automobile and after a redemption period (i.e., the period during which a borrower may cure the loan) has passed. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on government- guaranteed loans. Wholesale loans, risk -rated business bankin g loans and risk- rated auto loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized, including situations where a loan is determined to be both impair ed and collateral- dependent. The determination of whether to r ecognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the F irm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the estimated net r ealizable value, the determination of the fair v alue of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted mark et prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwillin g to pay, the Firm obtains a broker’s price opinion of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every six months thereafter. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), generally, either through foreclosure or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower, the Firm obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the in terior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and in terior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation v alues as compared to the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and in terior appraisals, considering state- and product-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Held-for-sale loans are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or losses recognized at the time of sale. Held-for-sale loans are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Because held-for-sale loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. Notes to consolidated financial statements 252 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Loans at fair value Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. For these loans, the earned curr ent contractual interest payment is recognized in interest income. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s nonaccrual, allowance for loan losses, and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. See Note 4 on pages 214–216 of this Annual Report for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 196–214 and 214–216 of this Annual Report for further information on loans carried at fair v alue and classified as trading assets. PCI loans PCI loans held-for-investment are initially measured at fair value. PCI loans have evidence of credit deterioration since the loan’s origination date and ther efore it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Because PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes an estimate of futur e credit losses, no allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans is recorded at the acquisition date. See page 266 of this Note for information on accounting for PCI loans subsequent to their acquisition. Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; losses due to chan ges in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, see Note 15 on pages 276–279 of this Annual Report. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss-mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss, avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximiz e payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications ar e accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired until it matures, is repaid, or is otherwise liquidated, regardless of whether the borr ower performs under the modified terms. In certain limited cases, the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is at or abo ve the current market rate at the time of the restructuring. In such circumstances, and assuming that the loan subsequently performs under its modified terms and the Firm expects to collect all contractual principal and interest cash flows, the loan is disclosed as impair ed and as a TDR only during the year of the modification; in subsequen t years, the loan is not disclosed as an impair ed loan or as a TDR so long as repayment of the restructured loan under its modified terms is reasonably assured. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR ar e generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in man y cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans ma y be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (a) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (b) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is r easonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is curr ent at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Because loans modified in TDRs ar e considered to be impaired, these loans are measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset -specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR r emains subject to the asset-specific allowance methodology throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. For further discussion of the methodolog y used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance, see Note 15 on pages 276–279 of this Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 253 Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, buildings, and fixtures) and commercial and personal property (e.g., aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and initially r ecognized at fair value less costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer , excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk char acteristics of each loan class: Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(c) Residential real estate – excluding PCI • Home equity – senior lien • Home equity – junior lien • Prime mortgage, including option ARMs • Subprime mortgage Other consumer loans • Auto(b) • Business banking(b) • Student and other Residential real estate – PCI • Home equity • Prime mortgage • Subprime mortgage • Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial • Real estate • Financial institutions • Government agencies • Other (a) Includes loans reported in CCB and residential real estate loans reported in the AM business segmen t and in Corporate/Private Equity. (b) Includes certain business bankin g and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodolog y for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other c onsumer loan classes. (c) Includes loans reported in CIB, CB and AM business segmen ts and in Corporate/Private Equity.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 255 Consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business bankin g loans, and student and other loans, with a primar y focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens and mortgage loans with interest-only payment options to predominantly prime borrowers, as well as certain payment-option loans originated b y Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization. The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 Residential real estate – excluding PCI Home equity: Senior lien $ 19,385 $ 21,765 Junior lien 48,000 56,035 Mortgages: Prime, including option ARMs 76,256 76,196 Subprime 8,255 9,664 Other consumer loans Auto 49,913 47,426 Business banking 18,883 17,652 Student and other 12,191 14,143 Residential real estate – PCI Home equity 20,971 22,697 Prime mortgage 13,674 15,180 Subprime mortgage 4,626 4,976 Option ARMs 20,466 22,693 Total retained loans $ 292,620 $ 308,427 Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/ or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear that the borrower is likely either unable or unwillin g to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (gr eater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquenc y rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, includin g both non-PCI and PCI portfolios, the current estimated L TV ratio, or the combined L TV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally , LTV or combined L TV can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-L TV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit-quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borr ower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (660 or below) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borr ower with a high FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high L TV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high L TV ratio and a high FICO score. • For scored auto, scored business banking and student loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution pr ovides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events. • Risk-rated business bankin g and auto loans are similar to wholesale loans in that the primar y credit quality indicators are the risk rating that is assigned to the loan and whether the loans ar e considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit and Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information about borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations. For further information about risk -rated wholesale loan credit quality indicators, see page 271 of this Note. Residential real estate – excluding PCI loans The following table provides information by class for residential real estate – excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer , excluding credit card, portfolio segment. The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the F irm’s residential real estate – excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(b) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due but insured by U.S. government agencies, are excluded from nonaccrual loans. In predominately all cases, 100% of the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. These amounts are excluded from nonaccrual loans because reimbursement of insured and guaranteed amounts is proceeding normally. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, these balances included $6.8 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest because interest has been curtailed by the U.S. government agencies although, in predominantly all cases, 100% of the principal is still insur ed. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. (c) At December 31, 2012, included $1.7 billion of loans recorded in accordance with regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be reported as nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. This $1.7 billion consisted of $450 million, $440 million, $500 million, and $357 million for home equity - senior lien, home equity - junior lien, prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and subprime mortgages, respectively. Certain of these loans have previously been reported as performing TDRs (e.g., loans that were previously modified under one of the F irm’s loss mitigation programs and that have made at least six payments under the modified pa yment terms). (d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balanc e of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models usin g nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates inc orporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. (e) Junior lien represents combined L TV , which considers all available lien positions r elated to the property. All other products are presented without consideration of subordinate liens on the property. (f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (g) At both December 31, 2012 and 2011, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $15.6 billion. (h) Includes $1.2 billion of performing junior liens at December 31, 2012, that are subordinate to senior liens that ar e 90 days or more past due; such junior liens ar e now being reported as nonaccrual loans based upon regulatory guidance issued in the first quarter of 2012. Of the total, $1.1 billion were current at December 31, 2012. Prior periods have not been restated.

(b) The Firm manages the risk of HEL OCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the collateral does not support the loan amount. Home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) within the required amortization period and home equit y loans (“HELOANs”) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily beca use the fully- amortizing payment required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates pr oduced by the Firm’s delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 259 Impaired loans At December 31, 2012, the Firm reported, in accordance with regulatory guidance, $1.6 billion of residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. Pursuant to that guidance, these Chapter 7 loans were charged off to the net realizable value of the collateral, resulting in $747 million of charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2012. Prior periods were not restated for this policy change. Prior to September 30, 2012, the Firm’s policy was to charge down to net realizable value, and also to place on nonaccrual status, loans to borrowers who had filed for bankruptcy when such loans became 60 days past due; however, the Firm did not previously report Chapter 7 loans as TDRs unless otherwise modified under one of the F irm’s loss mitigation programs. The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impair ed loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 15 on pages 276–279 of this Annual Report.

(b) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $7.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of loans permanently modified subsequen t to repurchase from Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA ”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Services (“RHS”)) are not included in the table abo ve. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, the y are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. (c) At December 31, 2012, included $1.6 billion of Chapter 7 loans, consisting of $450 million of senior lien home equity loans, $448 million of junior lien home equity loans, $465 million of prime including option ARMs, and $245 million of subprime mortgages. Certain of these loans were previously reported as nonaccrual loans (e.g., based upon the delinquency status of the loan). (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The unpaid principal balanc e differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. (e) At December 31, 2012, included $2.7 billion of Chapter 7 loans, consisting of $596 million of senior lien home equity loans, $990 million of junior lien home equity loans, $713 million of prime, including option ARMs, and $379 million of subprime mortgages. (f) As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, nonaccrual loans included $2.9 billion and $886 million, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 260 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Loan modifications The global settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required the Firm to, among other things, provide approximately $500 million of refinancing relief to certain “underwater” borrowers under the Refi Program and approximately $3.7 billion of additional relief to certain borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program, including reductions of principal on first and second liens. The purpose of the Refi Program was to allow eligible borrowers who were current on their mortgage loans to refinance their existing loans; such borrowers were otherwise unable to do so because they had no equity or, in many cases, negative equity in their homes. Under the R efi Program, the interest rate on each refinanced loan could have been reduced either for the remaining life of the loan or for five years. The Firm reduced the interest rates on loans that it refinanced under the Refi Program for the remaining lives of those loans. The refinancings generally did not result in term extensions and accordingly, in that regard, were more similar to loan modifications than to traditional refinancings. The Firm continues to modify first and second lien loans under the Consumer Relief Program. These loan modifications are primarily expected to be executed under the terms of either the U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable (“MHA ”) programs (e.g., the Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”), the Second Lien Modification Program (“2MP”)) or one of the Firm’s proprietary modification programs. For further information on the global settlement, see Global settlement on servicing and origination of mortgages in Note 2 on page 195 of this Annual Report. Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 261 Nature and extent of modifications MHA, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/ or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At December 31, 2012, there were approximately 37,300 of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 9,000 senior lien home equity loans, 20,700 junior lien home equity loans, 3,800 prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 3,800 subprime mortgages.

The dollar amoun ts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the r eporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, pa yment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan r edefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated thr ough foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. Approximately 85% of the trial modifications appr oved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the HAMP program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications. The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At December 31, 2012, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that ha ve been modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that w ere completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months, are 25% for senior lien home equity, 20% for junior lien home equity, 14% for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 24% for subprime mortgages. Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of dischar ge. Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days past due at the time of dischar ge have ranged between approximately 10% and 40% in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of dischar ge. At December 31, 2012, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 19% of senior lien home equity, 12% of junior lien home equity, 45% of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 32% of subprime mortgages that were 30 days or more past due. At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs w ere 6 years for senior lien home equity, 7 years for junior lien home equity, 10 years for prime mortgage, including option ARMs and 8 years for subprime mortgage. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Certain of these loans were previously reported as nonaccrual loans (e.g., based upon the delinquency status of the loan). Financial effects of modifications and redefaults For auto loans, TDRs typically occur in connection with the bankruptcy of the borrower. In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness. Beginning September 30, 2012, Chapter 7 auto loans are also considered TDRs. For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short- term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also ma y include interest rate reductions. The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $42 million and $80 million, during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The balance of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $46 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. The corresponding amount for the year ended December 31, 2011 was insignificant. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business bankin g loans, when the loan is two payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business bankin g loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any. The following table provides information about the financial ef fects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans for the periods presented.

A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. With respect to the Washington Mutual transaction, all of the consumer loans were aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics. On a quarterly basis, the Firm estimates the total cash flo ws (both principal and interest) expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool. These estimates inc orporate assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect then-current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows (i.e., increased credit losses) trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus an y related foregone interest cash flows, discounted at the pool’s effective interest rate. Impairments are recognized through the provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) w ould first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. Disposals of loans — which may include sales of loans, receipt of payments in full by the borrower, or foreclosure — result in removal of the loans from the PCI portfolio. The Firm continues to modify certain PCI loans. The impact of these modifications is inc orporated into the Firm’s quarterly assessment of whether a probable and significant change in expected cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans. In evaluating the effect of modifications on expected cash flows, the Firm incorporates the effect of any foregone interest and also considers the potential for redefault. The Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are used to compute expected credit losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlyin g loans and certain assumptions about home pric es and unemployment based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to date based on actual redefaulted PCI modified loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the underlying loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amoun t is not reported on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying pools of loans. If the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on PCI loans were determined not to be reasonably estimable , no interest would be accreted and the loans would be reported as nonaccrual loans; however, since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans are reasonably estimable , interest is being accreted and the loans are being reported as performing loans. Charge-offs are not recorded on PCI loans until actual losses exceed the estimated losses that w ere recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at acquisition date. Actual losses in excess of the purchase accounting adjustment are charged off against the PCI allowance for credit losses. T o date, no charge-offs have been recorded for these consumer loans. The PCI portfolio affects the Firm’s results of operations primarily through: (i) contribution to net interest margin; (ii) expense related to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii) an y provision for loan losses. The PCI loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction were funded based on the interest rate characteristics of the loans. F or example, variable-rate loans were funded with variable-rate liabilities and fix ed- rate loans were funded with fixed-rate liabilities with a similar maturity profile. A net spread will be earned on the declining balance of the portfolio, which is estimated as of December 31, 2012, to have a remaining weighted-average life of 8 years.

(d) Refreshed FICO scores, which the Firm obtains at least quarterly, represent each borrower’s most recent credit score. Notes to consolidated financial statements 268 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Approximately 21% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs.

(b) Substantially all undrawn HELOCs within the revolving period have been closed. (c) Predominantly all of these loans have been modified into fixed-rate amortizing loans. The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except ratios) Total PCI 2012 2011 2010 Beginning balance $ 19,072 $ 19,097 $ 25,544 Accretion into interest income (2,491) (2,767) (3,232) Changes in interest rates on variable-rate loans (449) (573) (819) Other changes in expected cash flows(a) 2,325 3,315 (2,396) Balance at December 31 $ 18,457 $ 19,072 $ 19,097 Accretable yield percentage 4.38% 4.33% 4.35% (a) Other changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the Firm continues to refine its cash flow model and periodically updates model assumptions. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, other changes in expected cash flows were principally driven by the impact of modifications, but also r elated to changes in prepayment assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2010, other changes in expected cash flows were principally driven by changes in prepayment assumptions, as well as reclassification to the nonac cretable difference. Changes to prepayment assumptions change the expected remaining life of the portfolio, which drives changes in expected future interest cash collections. Such changes do not have a significant impact on the accretable yield percentage. The factors that most significan tly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equit y loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions. From the date of acquisition through 2011, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily r elated to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidation periods. Mor e recently, however, the Firm has observed loan liquidation periods start to shorten, thus increasing the accretable yield percentage. Certain events, such as extended or shortened loan liquidation periods, af fect the timing of expected cash flows and the accretable yield percentage, but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). While extended loan liquidation periods r educe the accretable yield percentage (because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer- than-expected period of time), shortened loan liquidation periods would have the opposite effect. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 269 Credit card loan portfolio The Credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due), as well as information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due). In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator , the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality. However, the distribution of such sc ores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio. Refreshed FICO score information for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the table belo w; FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology. The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s credit card loans.

(b) There were no impaired loans without an allo wance. (c) Represents credit card loans outstanding to borrowers enrolled in a credit card modification program as of the date presented. (d) Represents credit card loans that were modified in TDRs but that have subsequently reverted back to the loans’ pre-modification payment terms. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $341 million and $762 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre- modification payment terms of the loans due to nonc ompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The r emaining $232 million and $377 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed. The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Average impaired credit card loans $ 5,893 $ 8,499 $10,730 Interest income on impaired credit card loans 308 463 605 Loan modifications JPMorgan Chase may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm has short-term programs for borrowers who may be in need of temporary relief, and long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs. Modifications under lon g-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. Modifications under all short- and long-term programs typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Certain borrowers enrolled in a short-term modification program may be given the option to re-enroll in a long-term program. Substantially all modifications ar e considered to be TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. Assuming that the cardholder does not begin to perform in accordance with those payment terms, the loan continues to age and will ultimately be char ged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In addition, if a borrower successfully completes a short-term modification program, then the loan reverts back to its pre- modification payment terms. However, in most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit. The following table provides information regarding the nature and extent of modifications of cr edit card loans for the periods presented.

Year ended December 31, (in millions, except weighted-average data) 2012 2011 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 15.67% 16.05% Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 5.19 5.28 Loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(a) $ 309 $ 687 (a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that e xperienced a payment default in the period presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amoun ts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, pa yment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average expected default rate for modified credit card loans was 38.23% at December 31, 2012, and 35.47% at December 31, 2011. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 271 Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a v ariety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the probability of default (“PD”) and the loss given default (“LGD”). PD is the likelihood that a loan will not be r epaid at default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor oper ates. As of September 30, 2012, the Firm revised its definition of the criticized component of the wholesale portfolio to align with the banking regulators’ definition of criticiz ed exposures, which consists of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Prior periods ha ve been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Risk ratings generally represent ratings profiles similar to those defined by S&P and Moody’ s. Investment grade ratings range from “ AAA/Aaa” to “BBB-/Baa3.” Nonin vestment grade ratings are classified as noncriticiz ed (“BB+/Ba1 and B-/B3”) and criticized (“CCC+”/“Caa1 and below”), and the criticiz ed portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher probability of default than noncriticiz ed loans. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. See Note 5 on page 217 in this Annual Report for further detail on industry concentrations.

The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale por tfolio segment for the periods indicated. The r eal estate class primarily c onsists of secured commercial loans mainly to borr owers for multi- family and commercial lessor properties. Multifamily lendin g specifically finances apartment buildings. Commercial lessors receive financing specifically for real estate leased to retail, office and industrial tenan ts. Commercial construction and development loans represent financing for the construction of apartments, office and professional buildings and malls. Other real estate loans include lodgin g, real estate investment trusts (“REIT s”), single-family , homebuilders and other real estate.

(b) Includes loans to Financial institutions, Go vernment agencies and Other . Financial effects of modifications and redefaults Loans modified as TDRs ar e typically term or payment extensions and, to a lesser e xtent, deferrals of principal and/or interest on commercial and industrial and r eal estate loans. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the average term extension granted on loans with term or payment extensions was 1.1 years and 3.3 years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified durin g these periods was 3.6 years and 4.5 years, respectively. Wholesale TDR loans that r edefaulted within one year of the modification were $56 million and $96 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period. Notes to consolidated financial statements 276 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 15 – Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses covers the consumer , including credit card, portfolio segments (primarily scored); and wholesale (risk -rated) portfolio, and represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset -specific component, a formula- based component and a component related to PCI loans, as described below. Management also estimates an allowance for wholesale and consumer lending-related commitments using methodologies similar to those used to estimate the allowance on the underlying loans. During 2012, the Firm did not make any significant changes to the methodologies or policies used to determine its allo wance for credit losses; such policies are described in the following paragraphs. The asset-specific component of the allowance relates to loans considered to be impaired, which includes loans that have been modified in TDRs as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. T o determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger loans are evaluated individually , while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. Scored loans (i.e., consumer loans) are pooled by product type, while risk-rated loans (primarily wholesale loans) are segmented by risk rating. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are reported as an adjustment to the provision for loan losses. In certain cases, the asset-specific allowance is determined using an observable market price, and the allowance is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan’s fair value. Impaired collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell and therefore may not be subject to an asset- specific reserve as for other impaired loans. See Note 14 on pages 250–275 of this Annual Report for more information about charge-offs and collateral-dependent loans. The asset-specific component of the allowance for impaired loans that have been modified in TDRs incorporates the effects of foregone interest, if any, in the present value calculation and also incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan ’s expected cash flows, which considers the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, the F irm develops product- specific probability of default estimates, which ar e applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. F or credit card loans modified in TDRs, e xpected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification pr ogram. For wholesale loans modified in TDRs, e xpected losses incorporate redefaults based on management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. The formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation to provide for probable principal losses inher ent in performing risk-rated loans and all consumer loans, except for any loans restructured in TDRs and PCI loans. See Note 14 on pages 250–275 of this Annual Report for more information on PCI loans. For scored loans, the statistical calculation is per formed on pools of loans with similar risk char acteristics (e.g., product type) and generally computed by applying expected loss factors to outstanding principal balances over an estimated loss emergence period. The loss emergence period represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the ultimate realization of that loss (thr ough a charge-off). Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. Loss factors are statistically deriv ed and sensitive to changes in delinquency status, credit scores, collateral values and other risk factors. The Firm uses a number of different forecasting models to estimate both the PD and the loss severity, including delinquency roll rate models and credit loss severity models. In developing PD and loss severity assumptions, the Firm also considers known and anticipated changes in the economic environment, including changes in home prices, unemployment rates and other risk indicators. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 277 A nationally recognized home price index measure is used to estimate both the PD and the loss se verity on residential real estate loans at the metr opolitan statistical ar eas (“MSA ”) level. Loss severity estimates are regularly validated by comparison to actual losses recognized on defaulted loans, market-specific real estate appraisals and property sales activity. The economic impact of potential modifications of residential real estate loans is not included in the statistical calculation beca use of the uncertainty regarding the type and results of such modifications. For risk-rated loans, the statistical calculation is the pr oduct of an estimated PD and an estimated L GD. These factors are differentiated by risk rating and expected maturity. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor oper ates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and curr ent information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Emphasizin g one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned by the Firm to that loan. PD estimates ar e based on observable external through-the-cycle data, using credit- rating agency default statistics. L GD estimates are based on the Firm’s history of actual credit losses over more than one credit cycle. Management applies judgment within an established framework to adjust the results of applying the statistical calculation described abo ve. The determination of the appropriate adjustment is based on management’s view of uncertainties that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the loss factors and that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. For the scored loan portfolios, adjustments to the statistical calculation are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. Factors related to unemployment, home prices, borrower behavior and lien position, the estimated effects of the mortgage foreclosure-related settlement with federal and state officials and uncertainties regarding the ultimate success of loan modifications ar e incorporated into the calculation, as appropriate. For junior lien products, management considers the delinquency and/or modification status of any senior liens in determinin g the adjustment. In addition, for the risk-rated portfolios, any adjustments made to the statistical calculation also c onsider concentrated and deteriorating industries. Management establishes an asset -specific allowance for lending-related commitments that are considered impaired and computes a formula-based allowance for performing consumer and wholesale lendin g-related commitments. These are computed using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in future periods. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Controller of the Firm and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio).

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the principal beneficiar y of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instrumen ts with the JPMor gan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Line-of-Business Transaction Type Activity Annual Report page reference CCB Credit card securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased credit card receivables 281 Other securitization trusts Securitization of originated automobile and student loans 281–283 Mortgage securitization trusts Securitization of originated and purchased residential mortgages 281–283 CIB Mortgage and other securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgages, automobile and student loans 281–283 Multi-seller conduits Investor intermediation activities: Assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner and structures transactions to meet investor needs 284–285 Municipal bond vehicles 285–286 Credit-related note and asset swap vehicles 286–288 The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs, but to a lesser e xtent, as follows: • Asset Management: Sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AM earns a fee based on assets managed; the f ee varies with each fund’ s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial r esults of these entities. • Commercial Banking: CB makes investments in and provides lending to community development entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. In addition, CB provides financing and lending related services to certain client-sponsored VIEs. In general, CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. • Corporate/Private Equity: Corporate uses VIEs to issue trust pr eferred securities. See Note 21 on pages 297–299 of this Annual Report for further information. The Private Equity business, within Corporate/Private Equity, may be involved with entities that are deemed VIEs. However, the Firm’s private equity business is subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 288 of this Note. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 281 Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities Credit card securitizations The Card business securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans, primarily thr ough the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes ser vicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to an y related modifications and workouts. Additionally , the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated abo ve, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts ar e available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; the y are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the F irm’s other creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided in terest in the credit card trusts (which generally ranges from 4% to 12%). As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $15.8 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 28% and 22% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm also retained $362 million and $541 million of senior securities and $4.6 billion and $3.0 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (includin g automobile and student loans) primarily in its CIB and C CB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/ or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. Notes to consolidated financial statements 282 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The following table presents the total unpaid principal amoun t of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests, recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 289 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 289–290 of this Note f or information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

(b) Consists of securities back ed by commercial loans (predominantly real estate) and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables purchased from third parties. The Firm generally does not retain a residual interest in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization tr ansactions. (c) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation methodology. (d) The table above excludes the following: retained servicing (see Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report for a discussion of MSRs); securities retained from loans sales to U.S. government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage in terest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization en tities (See Note 6 on pages 218–227 of this Annual Report for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $131 million and $45 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012, and $110 million and $8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities. (e) Includes interests held in re-securitization tr ansactions. (f) As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, 74% and 68%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization in terests, which are carried at fair value, were risk- rated “ A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $170 million and $136 million of investment-grade and $171 million and $427 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts c onsisted of $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion of investment-grade and $164 million and $283 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 283 Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans originated or purchased by CCB, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and w orkouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a r esult, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests) in residential mortgage securitizations upon securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. See the table on page 288 of this Note f or more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations. The Firm does not consolidate a residential mortgage securitization (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial in terest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that c ould potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 288 of this Note f or more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the pr evious page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitiz es commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB ma y retain unsold senior and/ or subordinated interests in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but , generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“ controlling class”). See the table on page 288 of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. The Firm also securitizes automobile and student loans. The Firm retains servicing responsibilities for all originated and certain purchased student and automobile loans and has the power to direct the activities of these VIEs thr ough these servicing responsibilities. See the table on page 288 of this Note for more information on the consolidated student loan securitizations, and the table on the pr evious page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-securitization tr ansactions in which debt securities ar e transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both agency (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs, which may be backed by either residential or commercial mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is lar gely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re- securitization trusts. Durin g the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Firm transferred $10.0 billion, $24.9 billion and $33.9 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $286 million, $381 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs. Most re-securitizations with which the F irm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific clien t or group of clients are seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its client(s), considering the joint effort and decisions in establishin g the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; ther efore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. Notes to consolidated financial statements 284 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report In more limited circumstances, the Firm creates a re- securitization trust independen tly and not in conjunction with specific clients. In these circumstances, the Firm is deemed to have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust beca use of the decisions made durin g the establishment and design of the trust; therefore, the Firm consolidates the re- securitization VIE if the F irm holds an interest that could potentially be significant. Additionally , the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party securitizations and gener ally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust , either because it wasn’t involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third party sponsor and demonstr ates shared power over the creation of the trust; ther efore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm consolidated $76 million and $348 million, respectively, of assets, and $5 million and $139 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 288 of this Note for more information on the consolidated re- securitization transactions. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, total assets (includin g the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re- securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $4.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm held approximately $2.0 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $61 million and $14 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 282 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that purchase interests in, and make loans secured by, pools of receivables and other financial assets pursuant to agreements with customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their pur chases and loans through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper . The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instanc es, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and ar e typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller . The deal- specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper , each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it pr ovided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider , as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. See page 288 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 285 In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper , including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi- seller conduits. The Firm held $8.3 billion and $11.3 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm’s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm provides lending- related commitments to certain clients of the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded portion of these commitments was $10.8 billion at both December 31, 2012 and 2011, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 29 on pages 308–315 of this Annual Report. VIEs associated with investor intermediation activities As a financial intermediary, the Firm creates certain types of VIEs and also structures transactions with these VIEs, typically using derivatives, to meet investor needs. The Firm may also provide liquidity and other support. The risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other cr edit, market or liquidity risks to which the Firm is exposed. The principal types of VIEs for which the Firm is engaged in on behalf of clients are municipal bond vehicles, credit-related note vehicles and asset swap vehicles. Municipal bond vehicles The Firm has created a series of trusts that pr ovide short- term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments, and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to financ e their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates. In a typical transaction, the vehicle purchases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the pur chase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residual interests”). The maturity of each of the puttable floating-rate certificates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle, while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is typically longer. Holders of the puttable floating-rate certificates may “put,” or tender , the certificates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floating-rate certificates to another in vestor. A liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates. Upon termination of the v ehicle, proceeds from the sale of the underlyin g municipal bonds would first repay any funded liquidity facility or outstanding floating-rate certificates and the remaining amount, if any, would be paid to the residual interests. If the proceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not sufficient to repay the liquidity facility, in certain transactions the liquidity provider has recourse to the residual interest holders for reimbursement. Certain residual interest holders may be required to post collateral with the Firm, as liquidity provider , to support such reimbursement obligations should the market value of the municipal bonds decline . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. often serves as the sole liquidity provider , and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC serves as remarketing agent, of the puttable floating-rate certificates. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain termination events, which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider , an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate do wngrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the Firm’s exposure as liquidity provider is further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the residual interest holders. However, a downgrade of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s short-term rating does not affect the Firm’s obligation under the liquidit y facility. The long-term credit ratings of the puttable floating rate certificates are directly related to the credit ratings of the underlying municipal bonds, the credit rating of any insurer of the underlying municipal bond, and the Firm’s short-term credit rating as liquidity provider . A downgrade in any of these ratings would affect the rating of the puttable floating-rate certificates and could cause demand for these certificates by investors to decline or disappear . As remarketing agent, the Firm may hold puttable floating- rate certificates of the municipal bond v ehicles. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm held $893 million and $637 million, respectively, of these certificates on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The largest amount held by the Firm at any time during 2012 was $1.8 billion, or 8%, of the municipal bond vehicles’ aggregate outstanding puttable floating-rate certificates. The Firm did not have and continues not to have any intent to protect any residual interest holder from potential losses on any of the municipal bond holdin gs. Notes to consolidated financial statements 286 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The Firm consolidates municipal bond v ehicles if it owns the residual interest. The residual interest generally allows the owner to make decisions that significan tly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, primarily by directing the sale of the municipal bonds owned by the vehicle. In addition, the residual interest owners have the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm does not consolidate municipal bond vehicles if it does not own the residual interests, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. See page 288 of this Note for further information on consolidated municipal bond vehicles. The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at December 31, 2012 and 2011, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows. December 31, (in billions) Fair value of assets held by VIEs Liquidity facilities Excess/(deficit) (a) Maximum exposure Nonconsolidated municipal bond vehicles 2012 $ 14.2 $ 8.0 $ 6.2 $ 8.0 2011 13.5 7.9 5.6 7.9 Ratings profile of VIE assets(b) Fair value of assets held by VIEs Wt. avg. expected life of assets (years) Investment-grade Noninvestment- grade December 31, (in billions, except where otherwise noted) AAA to AAA- AA+ to AA- A+ to A- BBB+ to BBB- BB+ and below 2012 $ 1.6 $ 11.8 $ 0.8 $ — $ — $ 14.2 5.9 2011 1.5 11.2 0.7 — 0.1 13.5 6.6 (a) Represents the excess/(deficit) of the fair values of municipal bond assets available to repay the liquidity facilities, if drawn. (b) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings and is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis. Credit-related note and asset swap vehicles Credit-related note vehicles The Firm structures transactions with credit-related note vehicles in which the VIE pur chases highly rated assets, such as asset-backed securities, and enters into a credit derivative contract with the Firm to obtain exposure to a referenced credit which the VIE otherwise does not hold. The VIE then issues credit-linked notes (“CLNs”) with maturities predominantly ranging from one to ten years in order to transfer the risk of the referenced credit to the VIE’s investors. Clients and investors often prefer using a CLN vehicle since the CLNs issued by the VIE generally carry a higher credit rating than such notes would if issued directly by JPMorgan Chase. As a derivative counterparty in a credit-related note structure, the Firm has a senior claim on the collateral of the VIE and reports such derivatives on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The collateral purchased by such VIEs is largely investment-grade, with a significant amount being rated “ AAA.” The Firm divides its credit-related note structures broadly into two types: static and managed. In a static credit-related note structure, the CLNs and associated credit derivative contract either reference a single credit (e.g., a multi-national corporation), or all or part of a fixed portfolio of credits. In a managed credit- related note structure, the CLNs and associated credit derivative generally reference all or part of an actively managed portfolio of credits. An agreement exists between a portfolio manager and the VIE that giv es the portfolio manager the ability to substitute each referenced credit in the portfolio for an alternative credit. The Firm does not act as portfolio manager; its involvement with the VIE is generally limited to being a derivative counterparty. As a net buyer of credit protection, in both static and managed credit-related note structures, the Firm pays a premium to the VIE in return for the receipt of a payment (up to the notional of the derivative) if one or more of the credits within the portfolio defaults, or if the losses resulting from the default of reference credits exceed specified levels. The Firm does not provide any additional contractual financial support to the VIE. In addition, the Firm has not historically provided any financial support to the CLN vehicles over and above its contractual obligations. Since each CLN is established to the specifications of the in vestors, the investors have the power over the activities of that VIE that most significantly affect the performance of the CLN. Furthermore, the Firm does not generally have a variable interest that could potentially be significant. Accordingly, the Firm does not generally consolidate these credit-related note entities. As a derivative counterparty, the Firm has a senior claim on the collateral of the VIE and reports such derivatives on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Substantially all of the assets pur chased by such VIEs are investment-grade. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 287 Asset swap vehicles The Firm structures and executes transactions with asset swap vehicles on behalf of investors. In such transactions, the VIE purchases a specific asset or assets and then en ters into a derivative with the Firm in order to tailor the interest rate or foreign exchange currency risk, or both, according to investors’ requirements. Generally, the assets are held by the VIE to maturity, and the tenor of the derivatives would match the maturity of the assets. Investors typically invest in the notes issued by such VIEs in order to obtain exposure to the credit risk of the specific assets, as w ell as exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk that is tailor ed to their specific needs. The deriv ative transaction between the Firm and the VIE may include currency swaps to hedge assets held by the VIE denominated in f oreign currency into the investors’ local currency or interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of assets held by the VIE; to add additional interest rate exposure into the VIE in order to increase the return on the issued notes; or to c onvert an interest-bearing asset into a zero-coupon bond. The Firm’s exposure to asset swap vehicles is generally limited to its rights and obligations under the interest rate and/or foreign exchange derivative contracts. The Firm historically has not pr ovided any financial support to the asset swap vehicles over and above its contractual obligations. The Firm does not generally consolidate these asset swap vehicles, since the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant. As a derivative counterparty, the Firm has a senior claim on the collateral of the VIE and reports such derivatives on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Substantially all of the assets pur chased by such VIEs are investment-grade. Exposure to nonconsolidated credit-related note and asset swap VIEs at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was as follows. December 31, 2012 (in billions) Net derivative receivables Total exposure Par value of collateral held by VIEs(a) Credit-related notes Static structure $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 7.3 Managed structure 0.6 0.6 5.6 Total credit-related notes 1.1 1.1 12.9 Asset swaps 0.4 0.4 7.9 Total $ 1.5 $ 1.5 $ 20.8 December 31, 2011 (in billions) Net derivative receivables Total exposure Par value of collateral held by VIEs(a) Credit-related notes Static structure $ 1.0 $ 1.0 $ 9.1 Managed structure 2.7 2.7 7.7 Total credit-related notes 3.7 3.7 16.8 Asset swaps 0.6 0.6 8.6 Total $ 4.3 $ 4.3 $ 25.4 (a) The Firm’s maximum exposure arises through the derivatives executed with the VIEs; the exposure varies over time with changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The Firm relies on the collateral held by the VIEs to pay any amounts due under the derivatives; the vehicles are structured at inception so that the par value of the collateral is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts due under the derivative contracts. Notes to consolidated financial statements 288 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The Firm consolidated Firm-sponsored and third-party credit-related note vehicles with collateral fair values of $483 million and $231 million, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm consolidated these vehicles, because it held positions in these en tities that provided the Firm with control of certain vehicles. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at December 31, 2012 and 2011. VIEs sponsored by third parties VIE used in FRBNY transaction In conjunction with the Bear Stearns merger in June 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) took control, through an LLC formed for this purpose, of a portfolio of $30.0 billion in assets, based on the value of the portfolio as of March 14, 2008. The assets of the LLC were funded by a $28.85 billion term loan from the FRBNY and a $1.15 billion subordinated loan from JPMorgan Chase. The JPMorgan Chase loan was subordinated to the FRBNY loan and bore the first $1.15 billion of any losses of the portfolio. Any remaining assets in the portfolio after repayment of the FRBNY loan, repayment of the JPMorgan Chase loan and the expense of the LLC was for the account of the FRBNY . The extent to which the FRBNY and JPMor gan Chase loans were repaid depended on the value of the assets in the portfolio and the liquidation str ategy directed by the FRBNY . The Firm did not consolidate the LLC, as it did not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance. In June 2012, the FRBNY loan was repaid in full and in November 2012, the JPMorgan Chase loan was repaid in full. During the year ended December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase recognized a pretax gain of $665 million reflecting the recovery on the $1.15 billion subordinated loan plus contractual interest. Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities r elated to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

The Firm consolidated $3.3 billion and $4.1 billion of student loan securitization en tities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (d) Includes assets classified as cash, deriv ative receivables, AFS securities, and other assets within the C onsolidated Balance Sheets. (e) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the pr ogram types above are used to settle the liabilities of those en tities. The difference between total assets and total liabilities r ecognized for consolidated VIEs represents the Firm’s interest in the consolidated VIEs for each program type. (f) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued b y consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $35.0 billion and $39.7 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The maturities of the lon g-term beneficial interests as of December 31, 2012, were as follows: $11.9 billion under one year, $16.0 billion between one and five years, and $7.1 billion over five years, all respectively. (g) Includes liabilities classified as ac counts payable and other liabilities in the C onsolidated Balance Sheets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 289 Supplemental information on loan securitizations The Firm securitizes and sells a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the F irm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when the ac counting criteria for a sale are met. Those criteria are: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations ac counted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue. Securitization activity The following tables provide information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization. 2012 2011 2010 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except rates)(a) Residential mortgage(d)(e) Commercial and other(f)(g) Residential mortgage(d)(e) Commercial and other(f)(g) Residential mortgage(d)(e) Commercial and other(f)(g) Principal securitized $ — $ 5,421 $ — $ 5,961 $ 35 $ 2,237 All cash flows during the period: Proceeds from new securitizations(b) $ — $ 5,705 $ — $ 6,142 $ 36 $ 2,369 Servicing fees collected 662 4 755 4 968 4 Purchases of previously transferred financial assets (or the underlying collateral)(c) 222 — 772 — 321 — Cash flows received on interests 185 163 235 178 319 143 (a) Excludes re-securitization tr ansactions. (b) Proceeds from commercial mortgage securitizations w ere received in the form of securities. Durin g 2012, $5.7 billion of commercial mortgage securitizations were classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. During 2011, $4.0 billion and $2.1 billion of commercial mortgage securitizations were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. During 2010, $2.2 billion and $172 million of residential and commercial mortgage securitizations were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. (c) Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from off–balance sheet, nonconsolidated entities – for example, loan repurchases due to representation and warranties and servicer clean-up calls (d) Includes prime, Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes sales for which the Firm did not securitiz e the loan (including loans sold to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). (e) There were no residential mortgage securitizations durin g 2012 and 2011. (f) Includes commercial and student loan securitizations . (g) Key assumptions used to measur e retained interests originated durin g the year included weighted-average life (in years) of 8.8, 1.7 and 7.1 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, and weighted-average discount rate of 3.6%, 3.5% and 7.7% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities In addition to the amoun ts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and pur chased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “ Agencies”). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization b y the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans and excess mortgage servicing rights through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the F irm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser . See Note 29 on pages 308–315 of this Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-r elated indemnifications. See Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights. Notes to consolidated financial statements 290 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and third-party-sponsored securitization entities. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Carrying value of loans sold(a) $ 180,097 $ 150,632 $ 156,615 Proceeds received from loan sales as cash $ 1,270 $ 2,864 $ 3,887 Proceeds from loan sales as securities(b) 176,592 145,340 149,786 Total proceeds received from loan sales(c) $ 177,862 $ 148,204 $ 153,673 Gains on loan sales(d) 141 133 212 (a) Predominantly to U.S. government agencies. (b) Predominantly includes securities fr om U.S. government agencies that are generally sold shortly after receipt. (c) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. Gains on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (d) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material br eaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 29 on pages 308–315 of this Annual Report, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $15.6 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been r epurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominately all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally , real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and r eal estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and reimbursement is proceeding normally. For additional information, refer to Note 14 on pages 250–275 of this Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase’s interest in securitized assets held at fair value The following table outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair v alue, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, of certain of the Firm’s retained interests in nonconsolidated VIEs (other than MSRs), that ar e valued using modeling techniques. The table also outlines the sensitivities of those fair v alues to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in assumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 291–295 of this Annual Report. Commercial and other December 31, (in millions, except rates and where otherwise noted)(a) 2012 2011(d) JPMorgan Chase interests in securitized assets(b) $ 1,488 $ 1,585 Weighted-average life (in years) 6.1 1.0 Weighted-average discount rate(c) 4.1% 59.1% Impact of 10% adverse change $ (34) $ (45) Impact of 20% adverse change (65) (76) (a) The Firm’s interests in prime mortgage securitizations w ere $341 million and $555 million, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These include retained interests in Alt-A loans and re- securitization transactions. The Firm’s interests in subprime mortgage securitizations were $68 million and $31 million, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Additionally , the Firm had interests in option ARM mortgage securitizations of $23 million at December 31, 2011. (b) Includes certain investments acquired in the secondary market but predominantly held for investment purposes. (c) Incorporates the Firm’s weighted-average loss assumption. (d) The prior period has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions gener ally cannot be extrapolated easily, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the chan ge in fair value may not be linear . Also, in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In r eality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another , which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The abo ve sensitivities also do not r eflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 291 Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitiz ed financial assets, in which the F irm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Note 17 – Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following. December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Goodwill $ 48,175 $ 48,188 $ 48,854 Mortgage servicing rights 7,614 7,223 13,649 Other intangible assets: Purchased credit card relationships $ 295 $ 602 $ 897 Other credit card-related intangibles 229 488 593 Core deposit intangibles 355 594 879 Other intangibles 1,356 1,523 1,670 Total other intangible assets $ 2,235 $ 3,207 $ 4,039 Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate , indicate there may be impairment. The goodwill associated with each business c ombination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed by the Firm’s Operating Committee. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segmen ts. December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Consumer & Community Banking $ 31,048 $ 30,996 $ 31,018 Corporate & Investment Bank 6,895 6,944 6,958 Commercial Banking 2,863 2,864 2,866 Asset Management 6,992 7,007 7,635 Corporate/Private Equity 377 377 377 Total goodwill $ 48,175 $ 48,188 $ 48,854 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Balance at beginning of period(a) $ 48,188 $ 48,854 $ 48,357 Changes during the period from: Business combinations 43 97 556 Dispositions (4) (685) (19) Other(b) (52) (78) (40) Balance at December 31,(a) $ 48,175 $ 48,188 $ 48,854 (a) Reflects gross goodwill balances as the Firm has not recognized any impairment losses to date. (b) Includes foreign currency translation adjustmen ts and other tax - related adjustments. The net reduction in goodwill from 2010 to 2011 was predominantly due to AM’s sale of its investment in an asset manager . Impairment testing Goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2012 or 2011, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during 2012, 2011 or 2010. The goodwill impairmen t test is performed in two steps. In the first step, the current fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value (including goodwill), then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value (including goodwill), then a second step is performed. In the second step, the implied current fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined b y comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step one) to the fair value of the net assets of the r eporting unit, as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. The resulting implied current fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied current fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. If the Notes to consolidated financial statements 292 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report carrying value of goodwill is less than its implied curr ent fair value, then no goodwill impairmen t is recognized. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated equity plus goodwill capital as a proxy for the carrying amounts of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairmen t testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of equit y to the Firm’s lines of business, which takes into consideration the capital the business segment would require if it were operating independently, incorporating sufficient capital to address regulatory capital requirements (including Basel III), economic risk measures and capital levels for similarly rated peers. Proposed line of business equity levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated equity is further reviewed on a periodic basis and updated as needed. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. The models project cash flows for the forecast period and use the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal v alues. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts, which include the estimated ef fects of regulatory and legislative changes (including, but not limited to the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the CARD Act, and limitations on non- sufficient funds and overdraft fees), and which are reviewed with the Operating Committee of the Firm. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricin g Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or managemen t’s forecasts and assumptions). T o assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk char acteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firms’ overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow models are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the general reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. Management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair value of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (a) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (b) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the firmwide le vel that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (c) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. While no impairment of goodwill was recognized, the Firm’s mortgage lending business in CCB remain at an elevated risk of goodwill impairmen t due to its exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of this business is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities), and the amoun t of equity capital required. In addition, the earnin gs or estimated cost of equity of the Firm’s capital markets businesses could also be affected by regulatory or legislative changes. The assumptions used in the disc ounted cash flow valuation models were determined using management’s best estimates. The cost of equity reflected the related risks and uncertainties, and was evaluated in comparison to relevant market peers. Deterioration in these assumptions c ould cause the estimated fair v alues of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline , which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights Mortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair v alue of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 293 The fair value of MSRs is sensitiv e to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (i.e., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of deriv atives and securities to manage chan ges in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2012 2011 2010 Fair value at beginning of period $ 7,223 $ 13,649 $ 15,531 MSR activity Originations of MSRs 2,376 2,570 3,153 Purchase of MSRs 457 33 26 Disposition of MSRs (579) (e) — (407) Changes due to modeled amortization (1,228) (1,910) (2,386) Net additions and amortization 1,026 693 386 Changes due to market interest rates (589) (5,392) (2,224) Other changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions(a) (46) (1,727) (44) Total change in fair value of MSRs(b) (635) (7,119) (2,268) Fair value at December 31(c) $ 7,614 $ 7,223 $ 13,649 Change in unrealized gains/ (losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31 $ (635) $ (7,119) $ (2,268) Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income $ 3,783 $ 3,977 $ 4,484 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31 (in billions) $ 867 $ 910 $ 976 Servicer advances at December 31 (in billions)(d) $ 10.9 $ 11.1 $ 9.9 (a) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as costs to service, home prices, mortgage spreads, ancillary income, and assumptions used to deriv e prepayment speeds, as well as changes to the valuation models themselv es. (b) Includes changes related to commercial real estate of $(8) million, $(9) million and $(1) million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (c) Includes $23 million, $31 million and $40 million related to commercial real estate at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest to a trust, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlyin g loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these adv ances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. (e) Includes excess mortgage servicing rights transferred to an agency- sponsored trust in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). A portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired and has retained the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading assets. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the fair value of the MSR decreased by $6.4 billion. This decrease was predominately due to a decline in mark et interest rates, which resulted in a loss in fair v alue of $5.4 billion. These losses were offset by gains of $5.6 billion on derivatives used to hedge the MSR asset; these deriv atives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets separately from the MSR asset. Also contributing to the decline in fair value of the MSR asset was a $1.7 billion decrease related to revised cost to service and ancillary income assumptions incorporated in the MSR valuation. The increased cost to service assumptions reflect the estimated impact of higher servicing costs to enhance servicing processes, particularly loan modification and f oreclosure procedures, including costs to comply with Consent Orders entered into with banking regulators. The increase in the cost to service assumption contemplates significan t and prolonged increases in staffing levels in the core and default servicing functions. The decreased ancillary income assumption is similarly related to a reassessment of business practices in consideration of the Consent Orders and the existing industry-wide regulatory environment, which is broadly affecting market participants. Also in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Firm revised its OAS assumption and updated its pr oprietary prepayment model; these changes had generally offsetting effects. The Firm’s OAS assumption is based upon capital and r eturn requirements that the Firm believes a market participant would consider , taking into account factors such as the pending Basel III capital rules. C onsequently, the OAS assumption for the Firm’s portfolio increased by approximately 400 basis points and decreased the fair value of the MSR asset by approximately $1.2 billion. Since 2009, the Firm has continued to refine its proprietary prepayment model based on a number of mark et-related factors, including a downward trend in home prices, a general tightening of credit underwriting standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Firm further enhanced its proprietary prepayment model to incorporate: (i) the impact of the Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”) 2.0, and (ii) assumptions that will limit modeled r efinancings due to the combined influences of relatively strict underwriting standards and reduced levels of expected home price appreciation. In the aggregate, these refinements increased the fair value of the MSR asset by approximately $1.2 billion. The decrease in the fair value of the MSR results in a lower asset value that will amortize in future periods against contractual and ancillary fee income received in future periods. While there is expected to be higher levels of noninterest expense associated with higher ser vicing costs Notes to consolidated financial statements 294 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report in those future periods, there will also be less MSR amortization, which will ha ve the effect of increasing mortgage fees and related income. The amortization of the MSR is reflected in the tables above under “Changes due to modeled amortization.” The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Mortgage fees and related income Net production revenue: Production revenue $5,783 $ 3,395 $3,440 Repurchase losses (272) (1,347) (2,912) Net production revenue 5,511 2,048 528 Net mortgage servicing revenue Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 3,772 4,134 4,575 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to modeled amortization (1,222) (1,904) (2,384) Total operating revenue 2,550 2,230 2,191 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates (587) (5,390) (2,224) Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to inputs or assumptions in model(a) (46) (1,727) (44) Change in derivative fair value and other 1,252 5,553 3,404 Total risk management 619 (1,564) 1,136 Net mortgage servicing revenue 3,169 666 3,327 All other 7 7 15 Mortgage fees and related income $8,687 $ 2,721 $3,870 (a) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as costs to service, home prices, mortgage spreads, ancillary income, and assumptions used to deriv e prepayment speeds, as well as changes to the valuation models themselv es. The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair v alue of the Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair v alues to immediate adv erse changes in those assumptions, as defined belo w. December 31, (in millions, except rates) 2012 2011 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”) 13.04% 18.07% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (517) $ (585) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (1,009) (1,118) Weighted-average option adjusted spread 7.61% 7.83% Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change $ (306) $ (269) Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change (591) (518) CPR: Constant prepayment rate. The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with ca ution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions gener ally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the chan ge in fair value are often highly inter-related and may not be linear . In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without chan ging any other assumption. In r eality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another , which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 295 Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are recorded at their fair value upon completion of a business combination or certain other transactions, and generally represent the value of customer relationships or arrangements. Subsequently, the Firm’s intangible assets with finite liv es, including core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationships, and other in tangible assets, are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits of the intangible asset. The $972 million decrease in other intangible assets during 2012 was due to $957 million in amortization, which included a $214 million impairment write-off of purchased credit card relationships and other cr edit card-related intangibles, as projected cash flows associated with a non-str ategic credit card relationship within C CB had deteriorated. The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows. 2012 2011 Gross amount(a) Accumulated amortization(a) Net carrying value Gross amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying valueDecember 31, (in millions) Purchased credit card relationships $ 3,775 $ 3,480 $ 295 $ 3,826 $ 3,224 $ 602 Other credit card-related intangibles 850 621 229 844 356 488 Core deposit intangibles 4,133 3,778 355 4,133 3,539 594 Other intangibles(b) 2,390 1,034 1,356 2,467 944 1,523 (a) The decrease in the gross amount and accumulated amortization from December 31, 2011, was due to the removal of fully amortized assets. (b) Includes intangible assets of approximately $600 million consisting primarily of asset managemen t advisory contracts, which were determined to have an indefinite life and are not amortized. Amortization expense The following table presents amortization expense related to credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets.

The impairment test for a finite-lived intangible asset compares the undiscounted cash flows associated with the use or disposition of the in tangible asset to its carrying value. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows exceeds its carrying value, then no impairment charge is recorded. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized in amortization expense to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized in amortization expense for the difference. Notes to consolidated financial statements 296 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 18 – Premises and equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lif e of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimated useful lif e of the leased asset. JPMorgan Chase has recorded immaterial asset retirement obligations related to asbestos remediation in those cases where it has sufficient information to estimate the obligations’ fair value. JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 297 Note 21 – Long-term debt JPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in v arious currencies, although predominantly U.S. dollars, with both fixed and variable interest rates. Included in senior and subor dinated debt below are various equity-linked or other indexed instruments, which the Firm has elected to measure at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table is a summary of long-term debt carrying values (including unamortized original issue discount, valuation adjustmen ts and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by remaining contractual maturity as of December 31, 2012.

All long- term debt guaranteed under the TLG Program matured prior to December 31, 2012. (b) Included $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2011 that was guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLG Program. All long-term debt guaranteed under the TLG Program matured prior to December 31, 2012. (c) The interest rates shown are the range of contractual rates in effect at year-end, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated deriv ative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable . The use of these derivative instruments modifies the Firm’s exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table abo ve. Including the effects of the hedge accounting derivatives, the range of modified rates in effect at December 31, 2012, for total long-term debt was (0.76)% to 7.86%, versus the contractual range of 0.16% to 8.75% presented in the table above. The interest rate ranges shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value. (d) Included long-term debt of $48.0 billion and $23.8 billion secured by assets totaling $112.8 billion and $89.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amoun ts related to hybrid instruments. (e) Included $30.8 billion and $34.7 billion of outstanding structured notes accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (f) Included $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities was $3.0 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. (g) Included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion of outstanding structured notes accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $28.2 billion and $26.2 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (h) At December 31, 2012, long-term debt in the aggregate of $22.1 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMor gan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the r espective notes. (i) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matur es in each of the five years subsequent to 2012 is $31.3 billion in 2013, $35.8 billion in 2014, $32.0 billion in 2015, $28.0 billion in 2016 and $33.6 billion in 2017. Notes to consolidated financial statements 298 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.09% and 3.57% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 2.33% and 2.67% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, includin g both long-term debt and structured notes sold as part of the Firm’s market-making activities. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Guaranteed liabilities were $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on futur e borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price. Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities On July 12, 2012, JPMorgan Chase redeemed $9.0 billion, or 100% of the liquidation amoun t, of the following guaranteed capital debt securities (“ trust preferred securities”): JPMorgan Chase Capital XV , JPMorgan Chase Capital XVII, JPMorgan Chase Capital XVIII, JPMorgan Chase Capital XX, JPMorgan Chase Capital XXII, JPMor gan Chase Capital XXV , JPMorgan Chase Capital XXVI, JPMorgan Chase Capital XXVII, and JPMorgan Chase Capital XXVIII. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2012, reflected $888 million of pretax extinguishment gains related to adjustments applied to the cost basis of the redeemed trust preferred securities during the period they were in a qualified hedge accounting relationship. At December 31, 2012, the Firm had outstandin g 17 wholly-owned Delaware statutory business trusts (“issuer trusts”) that had issued guar anteed capital debt securities. The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Firm to the issuer trusts, totalin g $10.4 billion and $20.9 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in long-term debt, and in the table on the preceding page under the caption “ Junior subordinated debt” (i.e., trust preferred securities). The Firm also records the common capital securities issued b y the issuer trusts in other assets in its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The debentures issued to the issuer trusts by the Firm, less the common capital securities of the issuer trusts, qualified as T ier 1 capital as of December 31, 2012.

Note 23 – Common stock At December 31, 2012 and 2011, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0 billion shares of common stock with a par value of $1 per share. Common shares issued (newly issued or distributed fr om treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 301 Pursuant to the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program, the Firm issued to the U.S. Treasury a Warrant to purchase up to 88,401,697 shares of the Firm’s common stock, at an exercise price of $42.42 per share, subject to certain antidilution and other adjustmen ts. The U.S. Treasury exchanged the Warrant for 88,401,697 warrants, each of which was a warrant to purchase a share of the Firm’s common stock at an exercise price of $42.42 per share and, on December 11, 2009, sold the warrants in a secondary public offering for $950 million. The warrants are exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time until October 28, 2018. As part of its common equity repurchase program discussed below, during 2012 and 2011, the Firm repurchased 18,471,300 and 10,167,698 warrants, for $238 million and $122 million, respectively, which resulted in adjustments to capital surplus. The Firm did not repurchase any of the warrants during 2010. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 59,762,699 and 78,233,999 warrants remained outstandin g. On March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program, of which $8.95 billion was authorized for repurchase in 2011. On March 13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion common equity repurchase program, of which up to $12.0 billion was approved for repurchase in 2012 and up to an additional $3.0 billion is approved for repurchases through the end of the first quarter of 2013. Following the voluntary cessation of its common equity repurchase program in May 2012, the Firm resubmitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the 2012 CCAR process in August 2012. Pursuant to a non-objection received from the Federal Reserve on November 5, 2012, with respect to the resubmitted capital plan, the Firm is authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of common equity in the first quarter of 2013. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Firm repurchased (on a trade-date basis) 31 million, 229 million, and 78 million shares of common stock, for $1.3 billion, $8.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities, see Part II, Item 5: Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder mat ters and issuer purchases of equity securities, on pages 22–23 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2012 Form 10-K. The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Ex change Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity – for example, during internal trading “black-out periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the F irm is not aware of material nonpublic in formation. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 325 million unissued shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, director compensation plans, and the warrants sold by the U.S. Treasury as discussed above. Note 24 – Earnings per share Earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnin gs (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their r espective rights to receive dividends. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock -based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends durin g the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holder s of common stock; these unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Options issued under emplo yee benefit plans that ha ve an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS . The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2012 2011 2010 Basic earnings per share Net income $ 21,284 $ 18,976 $ 17,370 Less: Preferred stock dividends 653 629 642 Net income applicable to common equity 20,631 18,347 16,728 Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 754 779 964 Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 19,877 $ 17,568 $ 15,764 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,809.4 3,900.4 3,956.3 Net income per share $ 5.22 $ 4.50 $ 3.98 Diluted earnings per share Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 19,877 $ 17,568 $ 15,764 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,809.4 3,900.4 3,956.3 Add: Employee stock options, SARs and warrants(a) 12.8 19.9 20.6 Total weighted-average diluted shares outstanding(b) 3,822.2 3,920.3 3,976.9 Net income per share $ 5.20 $ 4.48 $ 3.96 (a) Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS (due to the an tidilutive effect) were options issued under emplo yee benefit plans and the warrants originally issued in 2008 under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program to purchase shares of the Firm’s common stock. The aggregate number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such options and warrants was 148 million, 133 million and 233 million for the full years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively. (b) Participating securities were included in the calculation of diluted EPS usin g the two-class method, as this computation was more dilutive than the calculation using the treasury stock method.

A OCI decreased by $129 million due to the adoption of the accounting guidance related to VIEs, as a result of the reversal of the fair value adjustments taken on retained AFS securities that were eliminated in consolidation; for further discussion see Note 16 on pages 280–291 of this Annual Report. AOCI decreased by $15 million due to the adoption of guidanc e related to credit derivatives embedded in certain of the Firm’s AFS securities; for further discussion see Note 6 on pages 218–227 of this Annual Report. (b) Represents the after-tax difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities accounted for as AFS. (c) The net change during 2010 was due primarily to the narr owing of spreads on commercial and non-agency MBS as well as on collateralized loan obligations; also reflects increased market value on pass-through MBS due to narrowing of spreads and other market factors. (d) Included after-tax unrealized losses not related to credit on debt securities f or which credit losses have been recognized in income of $(56) million and $(81) million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no such losses at December 31, 2012. (e) The net change for 2011 was due primarily to incr eased market value on agency MBS and municipal securities, par tially offset by the widening of spreads on non-U.S. corporate debt and the realization of gains due to portfolio repositioning. (f) The net change for 2012 was predominantly driven by increased market value on non-U.S. residential MBS, corporate debt securities and oblig ations of U.S. states and municipalities, par tially offset by realized gains.

JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liabilit y method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities f or book and tax purposes. A ccordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax r ates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amoun t the Firm expects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities ma y ultimately be different from those currently reported. The components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated Statements of Income were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. Income tax expense/(benefit) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Current income tax expense U.S. federal $ 3,225 $ 3,719 $ 4,001 Non-U.S. 1,782 1,183 2,712 U.S. state and local 1,496 1,178 1,744 Total current income tax expense 6,503 6,080 8,457 Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal 2,238 2,109 (753) Non-U.S. (327) 102 169 U.S. state and local (781) (518) (384) Total deferred income tax expense/ (benefit) 1,130 1,693 (968) Total income tax expense $ 7,633 $ 7,773 $ 7,489 Total income tax expense includes $200 million, $76 million and $485 million of tax benefits recorded in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, as a result of tax audit resolutions. The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders’ equity and certain tax benefits associated with the Firm’s employee stock-based compensation plans. The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stockholders’ equity resulted in a decrease of $1.9 billion in 2012, and increases of $927 million and $1.8 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnin gs of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time . During 2012, as part of JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing review of the business requirements and capital needs of certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and their associated U.S . parent, the Firm determined that the undistributed earnin gs of certain of its subsidiaries would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. This determination resulted in the establishmen t of deferred tax liabilities and the r ecognition of an income tax expense of $80 million associated with prior y ears’ undistributed earnings. Based on JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing review of the business requirements and capital needs of its non-U.S . subsidiaries, combined with the formation of specific strategies and steps taken to fulfill these requirements and needs, the Firm has determined that the undistributed earnings of certain of its subsidiaries w ould be indefinitely reinvested to fund current and future growth of the related businesses. As management does not intend to use the earnings of these subsidiaries as a sour ce of funding for its U.S. operations, such earnings will not be distributed to the U.S. in the foreseeable future. For 2012, pretax earnings of approximately $3.1 billion were generated and will be indefinitely reinvested in these subsidiaries. A t December 31, 2012, the cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings in these subsidiaries approximated $25.1 billion. If the Firm were to record a deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, the amount would be approximately $5.7 billion at December 31, 2012. Tax expense applicable to securities g ains and losses for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $822 million, $617 million, and $1.1 billion, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 304 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report A reconciliation of the applicable statutor y U.S. income tax rate to the effective tax rate for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, is presented in the following table. Effective tax rate Year ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Increase/(decrease) in tax rate resulting from: U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit 1.6 1.6 3.6 Tax-exempt income (2.9) (2.1) (2.4) Non-U.S. subsidiary earnings(a) (2.4) (2.3) (2.2) Business tax credits (4.2) (4.0) (3.7) Other, net (0.7) 0.9 (0.2) Effective tax rate 26.4% 29.1% 30.1% (a) Includes earnings deemed to be reinvested indefinitely in non-U.S . subsidiaries. Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measur ed for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significan t components of deferred tax assets and liabilities ar e reflected in the following table as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Deferred taxes December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 Deferred tax assets Allowance for loan losses $ 8,712 $ 10,689 Employee benefits 4,308 4,570 Accrued expenses and other(a) 12,393 11,183 Non-U.S. operations 3,537 2,943 Tax attribute carryforwards 1,062 1,547 Gross deferred tax assets(a) 30,012 30,932 Valuation allowance (689) (1,303) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance(a) $ 29,323 $ 29,629 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation and amortization(a) $ 2,563 $ 2,799 Mortgage servicing rights, net of hedges (a) 5,336 4,396 Leasing transactions(a) 2,242 2,348 Non-U.S. operations 3,582 2,790 Other , net(a) 4,340 2,520 Gross deferred tax liabilities(a) 18,063 14,853 Net deferred tax assets $ 11,260 $ 14,776 (a) The prior period has been revised to conform with the current presentation. JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2012, in connection with U.S. federal and state and local net oper ating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2012, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $1.5 billion; the state and local net operating loss carryforward was approximately $269 million; and the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward was approximately $525 million. If not utilized, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and the state and local net operating loss carryforward will expire between 2027 and 2030; and the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward will expire in 2022. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2012, was due to losses associated with non-U.S . subsidiaries. During 2012, the valuation allowance decreased by $614 million largely related to the realization of state and local tax benefits. At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $7.2 billion, $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, of which $4.2 billion, $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that w ould be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that significan t changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months. JPMorgan Chase does not expect that any changes over the next 12 months in its gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits caused by such audits would result in a significant change in its annual effective tax rate. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 305 Unrecognized tax benefits Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Balance at January 1, $ 7,189 $ 7,767 $ 6,608 Increases based on tax positions related to the current period 680 516 813 Decreases based on tax positions related to the current period — (110) (24) Increases based on tax positions related to prior periods 234 496 1,681 Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods (853) (1,433) (1,198) Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (50) (16) (74) Decreases related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations (42) (31) (39) Balance at December 31, $ 7,158 $ 7,189 $ 7,767 After-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties r elated to income tax liabilities r ecognized in income tax expense were $147 million, $184 million and $(54) million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, in addition to the liabilit y for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, for income tax- related interest and penalties. JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many states throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of significan t income tax examinations of JPMor gan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 306 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 27 – Restrictions on cash and intercompany funds transfers The business of JPMor gan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”) is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The Bank is a member of the U.S . Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S . are insured by the FDIC. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of reserve balances deposited by the Firm’s bank subsidiaries with v arious Federal Reserve Banks was approximately $5.6 billion and $4.4 billion in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans ar e secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans to the Firm or to other affiliates are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined b y the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of all such loans is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The principal sources of JPMorgan Chase’s income (on a parent company-only basis) are dividends and interest from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and the other banking and nonbanking subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Super visory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries that ar e banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bankin g organization. At January 1, 2013, JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, $18.4 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2013 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year. In compliance with rules and regulations established b y U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash in the amount of $25.1 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively, and securities with a fair v alue of $0.7 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively, were segregated in special bank accounts for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers. In addition, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm had other restricted cash of $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, primarily representing cash reserves held at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes. Note 28 – Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital r equirements, including well-capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A. There are two categories of risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders’ equity, perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust pr eferred securities, less goodwill and c ertain other adjustmen ts. Tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, subordinated long-term debt and other instrumen ts qualifying as Tier 2 capital, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Risk- weighted assets (“RW A”) consist of on– and off–balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On–balance sheet assets are risk- weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off–balance sheet assets, such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, and derivatives, are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on–balance sheet credit-equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on– balance sheet assets. Risk -weighted assets also incorporate a measure for the market risk related to applicable tr ading assets–debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories ar e then aggregated to determine total risk -weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the F ederal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total capital to risk -weighted assets, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. Banking subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 307 The following table presents the regulatory capital, assets and risk -based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011. These amounts are determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and/or OCC. The following table reflects an adjustment to RWA to reflect regulatory guidance regarding a limited number of mark et risk models used for certain positions held by the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. during the first half of 2012, including the synthetic credit portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the adjustment to RWA decreased substantially as a result of regulatory approval of certain market risk models and a reduction in related positions.

If these securities were excluded from the calculation at December 31, 2012, Tier 1 capital would be $149.8 billion and $111.2 billion, respectively, and the Tier 1 capital ratio would be 11.8% and 10.2%, respectively. At December 31, 2012, Chase Bank USA, N.A. had no trust preferred securities. (b) Includes off–balance sheet risk-weighted assets at December 31, 2012, of $304.5 billion, $297.1 billion and $16 million, and at December 31, 2011, of $301.1 billion, $291.0 billion and $38 million, for JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., respectively. (c) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculatin g the leverage ratio, include total quarterly average assets adjusted for unrealized gains/(losses) on securities, less deductions for disallowed goodwill and other intangible assets, investments in certain subsidiaries, and the total adjusted carr ying value of nonfinancial equity investments that are subject to deductions from Tier 1 capital.

Note: Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upw ard for deferred tax liabilities, which ha ve resulted from both nontaxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from nontaxable business combinations totalin g $291 million and $414 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Note 29 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instrumen ts represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale contracts, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 15 on pages 276–279 of this Annual Report for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instrumen ts, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notic e as permitted by law. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. Also, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (b) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included credit enhancements and bond and commercial paper liquidity commitments to U.S. states and municipalities, hospitals and other non-pr ofit entities of $44.5 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively. These commitments also include liquidity facilities to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs; f or further information, see Note 16 on pages 280–291 of this Annual Report. (c) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included unissued standb y letters of credit commitments of $44.4 billion and $44.1 billion, respectively. (d) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, JPMorgan Chase held collateral relating to $42.7 billion and $41.5 billion, respectively, of standby letters of credit; and $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of other letters of credit. (e) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $165.1 billion and $186.3 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral comprises primarily cash and securities issued b y governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies. (f) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the amount of commitments related to forward-starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borr owing agreements were $13.2 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borr owing agreements with regular-way settlement periods were $21.7 billion and $25.5 billion, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (g) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included unfunded commitments of $370 million and $789 million, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $1.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, to other equity investments. These commitments included $333 million and $820 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3 on pages 196–214 of this Annual Report. In addition, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a mark et risk basis of $4.5 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. (h) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative- related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. Notes to consolidated financial statements 310 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financin gs in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearin g organizations. Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged and acquisition finance activities, which were $8.8 billion and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 196–214 and 214–216 respectively, of this Annual Report. In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as clearing and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to intra- day credit risk of the cash borr owers, usually broker- dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. For the three months ended December 31, 2012, the tri-party repurchase daily balances averaged $409 billion. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lendin g indemnifications, certain indemnification agr eements included within thir d-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For certain types of guarantees, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an of fsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. For indemnifications provided in sales agreements, a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guar antee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liabilit y is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification e xpires). Any contingent liability that exists as a result of issuing the guarantee or indemnification is r ecognized when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable . The contingent portion of the liability is not recognized if the estimated amoun t is less than the carrying amount of the liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). The recorded amounts of the liabilities r elated to guarantees and indemnifications at December 31, 2012 and 2011, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 311 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financin gs, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $649 million and $698 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $284 million and $319 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending- related commitments, and $365 million and $379 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset. The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standb y letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit 2012 2011 December 31, (in millions) Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Other letters of credit Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Other letters of credit Investment-grade(a) $ 77,081 $ 3,998 $ 78,884 $ 4,105 Noninvestment-grade(a) 23,848 1,575 23,015 1,281 Total contractual amount $ 100,929 (b) $ 5,573 $ 101,899 (b) $ 5,386 Allowance for lending-related commitments $ 282 $ 2 $ 317 $ 2 Commitments with collateral 42,654 1,145 41,529 1,264 (a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings which generally correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’ s. (b) At December 31, 2012 and 2011, included unissued standb y letters of credit commitments of $44.4 billion and $44.1 billion, respectively. Advised lines of credit An advised line of credit is a revolving credit line which specifies the maximum amoun t the Firm may make available to an obligor , on a nonbinding basis. The borrower receives written or oral advice of this facility. The Firm may cancel this facility at any time by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notic e as permitted by law. Securities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s securities lending program, customers’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arr angements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lendin g agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. T o minimize its liability under these indemnification agr eements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid c ollateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate . Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending customer with the cash equivalent thereof. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees In addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that r equire the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the futur e. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less. Derivative guarantees also include contracts such as stable value derivatives that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value derivatives, commonly referred to as “stable value wraps”, are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio and are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to terminate the contract under certain conditions. Notes to consolidated financial statements 312 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Derivative guarantees are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in trading assets and trading liabilities. The total notional v alue of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $61.7 billion and $75.6 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substan tially lower percentage of the notional amoun t; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $26.5 billion and $26.1 billion and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $122 million and $555 million and derivative receivables of $80 million and $98 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 on pages 218–227 of this Annual Report. Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into reverse repurchase agreements and securities borr owing agreements that settle at a future date. At settlement, these commitments require that the Firm advance cash to and accept securities from the counterparty. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a deriv ative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until settlement date. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the amount of commitments related to forward starting reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements were $13.2 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively. Commitments related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and securities borr owing agreements with regular way settlement periods were $21.7 billion and $25.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In connection with the Firm’s loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs and other loan sale and priv ate- label securitization tr ansactions, as described in Note 16 on pages 280–291 of this Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/ or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material br eaches of these representations and warranties. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balanc e of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense. Subsequent to the Firm’s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of W ashington Mutual from the FDIC in September 2008, the Firm resolved and/or limited certain current and future repurchase demands for loans sold to the GSEs by Washington Mutual, although it r emains the Firm’s position that such obligations remain with the FDIC receivership. As of December 31, 2012, the Firm believes that it has no remaining exposure related to loans sold by Washington Mutual to the GSEs. There have been generalized allegations, as well as specific demands, that the Firm repurchase loans sold or deposited into private-label securitizations (includin g claims from insurers that have guaranteed certain obligations of the securitization trusts). Although the F irm encourages parties to use the contractual repurchase process established in the governing agreements, these private-label repurchase claims have generally manifested themselves through threatened or pending litigation. Accordingly, the liability related to repurchase demands associated with all of the private-label securitizations is separ ately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 31 on pages 316– 325 of this Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 313 To estimate the Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, the Firm considers: (i) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase demands, (ii) estimated probable future repurchase demands considering information about file requests, delinquent and liquidated loans, r esolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and the Firm’s historical experience, (iii) the potential ability of the Firm to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands (“cure rate”), (iv) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement, or indemnification, (v) the Firm’s potential ability to recover its losses from third-party originators, and (vi) the terms of agreements with certain mortgage insurers and other parties. Based on these factors, the Firm has recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $2.8 billion and $3.6 billion, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities net of probable recoveries from third-party originators of $441 million and $577 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability is intended to cover losses associated with all loans pr eviously sold in connection with loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs, regardless of when those losses occur or how they are ultimately resolved (e.g., repurchase, make-whole payment). The liability related to all repurchase demands associated with priv ate-label securitizations is separ ately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firm’s established methodology for computing its recorded mortgage repurchase liability — including the amount of probable future demands from the GSEs (based on both historical e xperience and the Firm’s expectations about the GSEs futur e behavior), the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, and recoveries from third parties — require application of a significan t level of management judgment. While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its mortgage repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 2012, are reasonably possible. The Firm believes the estimate of the range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of its established r epurchase liability, is from $0 to approximately $0.9 billion at December 31, 2012. This estimated range of reasonably possible loss considers the Firm’s GSE-related exposure based on an assumed peak to trough decline in home prices of 40%, which is an additional 10 percentage point decline in home prices beyond the Firm’s current assumptions (which w ere derived from a nationally recognized home price index). Although the Firm does not consider a further decline in home prices of this magnitude lik ely to occur, such a decline could increase the levels of loan delinquencies, which ma y, in turn, increase the level of repurchase demands from the GSEs and potentially result in additional r epurchases of loans at greater loss severities; each of these factors could affect the Firm’s mortgage repurchase liability. The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented. Summary of changes in mortgage repurchase liability(a) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Repurchase liability at beginning of period $ 3,557 $ 3,285 $ 1,705 Realized losses(b) (1,158) (1,263) (1,423) Provision for repurchase losses(c) 412 1,535 3,003 Repurchase liability at end of period $ 2,811 $ 3,557 $ 3,285 (a) All mortgage repurchase demands associated with priv ate-label securitizations ar e separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. (b) Includes principal losses and ac crued interest on repurchased loans, “make-whole” settlements, settlements with claimants, and certain related expense. Make-whole settlements were $524 million, $640 million and $632 million, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (c) Includes $112 million, $52 million and $47 million of provision related to new loan sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 314 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstandin g principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations ar e predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the unpaid principal balanc e of loans sold with recourse totaled $9.3 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $141 million and $148 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors, the Firm may enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that require the Firm to make a payment to them in the event of a change in tax law or an adverse interpretation of tax law. In certain cases, the contract also may include a termination clause, which would allow the Firm to settle the contract at its fair value in lieu of making a payment under the indemnification cla use. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a thir d party (“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies sof tware licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the F irm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arr angements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Credit card charge-backs Chase Paymentech Solutions, Card’s merchant services business and a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is a global leader in payment processing and merchant acquiring. Under the rules of Visa USA, Inc., and MasterCard International, JPMor gan Chase Bank, N.A., is liable primarily for the amount of each processed credit card sales transaction that is the subject of a dispute between a cardmember and a merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardmember’s favor, Chase Paymentech will (through the cardmember’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardmember and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Chase Paymentech is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Chase Paymentech will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardmember . Chase Paymentech mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or by obtaining other security. However, in the unlikely event that: (1) a merchant ceases operations and is unable to deliver products, services or a refund; (2) Chase Paymentech does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant to provide customer refunds; and (3) Chase Paymentech does not have sufficient financial resources to provide customer refunds, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., would be liable for the amount of the transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2012, Chase Paymentech incurred aggregate credit losses of $16 million on $655.2 billion of aggregate volume processed, and at December 31, 2012, it held $203 million of collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2011, Chase Paymentech incurred aggregate credit losses of $13 million on $553.7 billion of aggregate volume processed, and at December 31, 2011, it held $204 million of collateral. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Chase Paymentech incurred aggregate credit losses of $12 million on $469.3 billion of aggregate volume processed, and at December 31, 2010, it held $189 million of collateral. The Firm believes that, based on historical experience and the collateral held by Chase Paymentech, the fair value of the Firm’s charge back-related obligations, which are representative of the payment or performance risk to the Firm, is immaterial. Exchange and clearinghouse guarantees The Firm is a member of several securities and futur es exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member . Such obligations vary with different organizations. These oblig ations may be limited to members who dealt with the defa ulting member or to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to a member’s guarantee fund, or , in a few cases, the obligation may be unlimited. It is difficult to estimate the F irm’s maximum exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm clears transactions on behalf of its clien ts through various clearinghouses, and the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients on such trades. The Firm mitigates its exposure to loss in the event of a client default by requiring that clients provide appropriate amounts of margin at the inception and throughout the life of the transaction, and can cease the provision of clearing services JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 315 if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. It is difficult to estimate the F irm’s maximum exposure under such transactions, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries ar e included on the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain debt of its subsidiaries, includin g both long-term debt and structured notes sold as part of the Firm’s market-making activities. These guarantees are not included in the table on page 309 of this Note. For additional information, see Note 21 on pages 297–299 of this Annual Report. Note 30 – Commitments, pledged assets and collateral Lease commitments At December 31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for banking purposes, and for energy-related tolling service agreements. Certain leases contain renewal options or escalation clauses providing for increased rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, or they require the Firm to perform restoration work on leased premises. No lease agreement imposes restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. The following table presents required future minimum rental payments under operating leases with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31, 2012. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2013 $ 1,788 2014 1,711 2015 1,571 2016 1,431 2017 1,318 After 2017 6,536 Total minimum payments required(a) 14,355 Less: Sublease rentals under noncancelable subleases (1,732) Net minimum payment required $ 12,623 (a) Lease restoration obligations are accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and are not reported as a required minimum lease payment. Total rental expense was as follows. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Gross rental expense $ 2,212 $ 2,228 $ 2,212 Sublease rental income (288) (403) (545) Net rental expense $ 1,924 $ 1,825 $ 1,667 Pledged assets At December 31, 2012, assets were pledged to collateralize repurchase and other securities financin g agreements, maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, includin g to secure borrowings and public deposits. Certain of these pledged assets ma y be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial instrumen ts owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm had pledged $291.7 billion and $270.3 billion, respectively, of financial instruments it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets ar e used to settle the liabilities of those en tities. See Note 16 on pages 280– 291 of this Annual Report for additional information on assets and liabilities of c onsolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financin g activities and long-term debt, see Note 13 on page 249, and Note 21 on pages 297–299, respectively, of this Annual report. The significant components of the Firm’s pledged assets were as follows. December 31, (in billions) 2012 2011 Securities $ 110.1 $ 134.8 Loans 207.2 198.6 Trading assets and other 155.5 122.8 Total assets pledged $ 472.8 $ 456.2 Notes to consolidated financial statements 316 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Collateral At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Firm had accepted assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $825.7 billion and $742.1 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $546.8 billion and $515.8 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. Note 31 – Litigation Contingencies As of December 31, 2012, the Firm and its subsidiaries ar e defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class member s. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self- regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitr ation or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in e xcess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $6.1 billion at December 31, 2012. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm’s best estimate of such losses f or those cases for which such estimate can be made . For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm’s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numer ous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Auction-Rate Securities Investigations and Litigation. Beginning in March 2008, several regulatory authorities initiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerning possible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities (“ ARS”). The market for many such securities had frozen and a significant number of auctions for those securities began to fail in February 2008. The Firm, on behalf of itself and affiliates, agreed to a settlement in principle with the Ne w York Attorney General’s Office which provided, among other things, that the Firm would offer to purchase at par certain ARS purchased from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Chase Investment Services Corp. and Bear , Stearns & Co. Inc. by individual investors, charities and small- to medium-siz ed businesses. The Firm also agreed to a substantively similar settlement in principle with the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida and the North American Securities A dministrators Association (“NASAA”) Task Force, which agreed to recommend approval of the settlement to all remaining states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Firm has finalized the settlement agreements with the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida. The settlement agreements provide for the payment of penalties totalin g $25 million to all states and territories. T o date, final consent agreements have been reached with all but three of NASAA’s members. The Firm also was named in two putative antitrust class actions. The actions allege that the Firm, along with numerous other financial institution def endants, colluded to maintain and stabilize the ARS market and then to withdraw their support for the ARS market. In January 2010, the District Court dismissed both actions. An appeal is pendin g in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering. In January 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co. entered into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. entered into a Consent Order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) relating principally to JPMor gan Chase & Co.’s and such banks’ policies, procedures and controls relating to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering requirements. The Firm neither admitted nor denied the regulatory agencies’ findings in the orders. Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters. The Bear Stearns Companies LLC (formerly The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.) (“Bear Stearns”), certain current or former subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, including Bear Stearns Asset Managemen t, Inc. (“BSAM”) and Bear , Stearns & Co. Inc., and certain individuals formerly employed by Bear Stearns are named defendants (collectively the “Bear Stearns defendants”) in multiple civil actions and arbitrations relating to alleged JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 317 losses resulting from the failure of the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the “High Grade Fund”) and the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the “Enhanced Leverage Fund”) (collectively the “Funds”). BSAM served as investment manager for both of the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands “feeder funds” that invested substantially all their assets, dir ectly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are in liquidation. There are currently three civil actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Funds. One of these actions involves a derivative lawsuit brought on behalf of purchasers of partnership interests in the U.S. feeder fund to the Enhanced Leverage Fund, alleging that the Bear Stearns defendants mismanaged the Funds. This action seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages based on alleged investor losses. The parties have reached an agreement to settle this derivative action, pursuant to which BSAM would pay a maximum of approximately $18 million. In April 2012, the District Court granted final approval of this settlement. In May 2012, objectors representing certain interests in the U.S. feeder fund filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the District Court’s final approval of the settlement. That appeal is currently pending. The second pending action, brought by the Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feeder funds, makes allegations similar to those asserted in the derivative lawsuits related to the U.S. feeder funds. This action alleges net losses of approximately $700 million and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The parties recently reached an agreement in principle to resolve the litigation contingent on the execution of a written settlement agreement. The third action was brought by Bank of America and Banc of America Securities LL C (together “BofA ”) alleging breach of contract, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with a $4 billion securitization in May 2007 known as a “CDO-squared,” for which BSAM served as collateral manager . This securitization w as composed of certain collateralized debt obligation holdings that were purchased by BofA from the Funds. BofA currently seeks damages up to approximately $540 million. Motions for summary judgment are pending. Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters. Various shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Bear Stearns between December 14, 2006, and March 14, 2008 (the “Class Period”). The actions alleged that the defendants issued materially false and misleadin g statements regarding Bear Stearns’ business and financial results and that, as a result of those false statemen ts, Bear Stearns’ common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. In November 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval of a $275 million settlement. Bear Stearns, former members of Bear Stearns’ Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns’ former executive officers have also been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative and class action suit which is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securities laws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, and indemnification and contribution in connection with the losses sustained b y Bear Stearns as a result of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common stock. Certain individual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of Bear Stearns common stock while in possession of material nonpublic in formation. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amoun t. The District Court dismissed the action in January 2011, and plaintiffs have appealed. The appeal has been withdr awn pursuant to a stipulation that giv es plaintiffs until March 1, 2013 to reinstate. CIO Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to a consolidated shareholder class action, a consolidated class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA ”), shareholder derivative actions, shareholder demands and government investigations relating to losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). The Firm has received requests for documents and information in connection with governmental inquiries and investigations by Congress, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the UK Financial Services Authority, the State of Massachusetts and other government agencies. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations. Four putative class actions alleging violations of Sections 10 (b) and 20(a) of the Securities Ex change Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Firm’s common stock. The cases were consolidated, lead plaintiffs were appointed pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed in November 2012 that defines the putativ e class as purchasers of the Firm’s common stock between February 24, 2010 and May 21, 2012. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that the Firm and certain current and former officers made false or misleading statements concerning CIO’s role, the Firm’s risk management practices and the Firm’s financial results, as well as in connection with the disclosur e of losses in the synthetic credit portfolio in 2012. Separately, two putative class actions were filed on behalf of participants who held the Firm’s common stock in the Firm’s retirement plans. These actions assert claims under ERISA for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the Firm, certain affiliates and certain current and former directors Notes to consolidated financial statements 318 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report and officers in connection with the managemen t of those plans. The complaints generally allege that defendants breached the duty of prudence by allowing investment in the Firm’s common stock when they knew or should have known that such stock was unsuitable for the plans and that the Firm and certain current and former officers made false or misleading statements concerning the Firm’s financial condition. These actions have been consolidated, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed in December 2012 which alleges a class period of Dec ember 20, 2011 to July 12, 2012. The consolidated amended complaint contains allegations similar to those in the original complaints, but now asserts claims only on behalf of participants in the Firm’s 401(k) Savings Plan. Four shareholder derivative actions have also been filed, purportedly on behalf of the Firm, against certain of the Firm’s current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. These actions generally allege that defendants failed to exercise adequate oversight over CIO and to manage the risk of CIO ’s trading activities, which allegedly led to CIO ’s losses. Two of these four actions have been consolidated, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed in December 2012. An amended complaint in one of the other derivative actions was filed in January 2013. The consolidated securities ac tion, consolidated ERISA action and the consolidated shareholder derivative action are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, while the two other derivative actions are pending in New York State court. In October 2012, defendants moved to dismiss one of the two shareholder derivative actions pending in New York State court on the ground that plaintiff failed to make a demand on the Firm’s Board of Directors or adequately allege demand futility, as required by applicable Delaware law. Defendants have not yet responded to the complaints in any of the other actions. In January 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co. entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Consent Order with the OCC arising out of the Federal Reserve’s and the OCC’s reviews of the CIO, including the synthetic credit portfolio previously held by the CIO. The Consent Orders relate to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm. Many of the actions required by the Consent Orders have already been, or are in the process of being, implemented by the Firm. City of Milan Litigation and Criminal Investigation. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the “ City”) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (together , “JPMorgan Chase”) in the District Court of Milan. The proceedings relate to (a) a bond issue by the City in June 2005 (the “Bond”), and (b) an associated sw ap transaction, which was subsequently restructured on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2007 (the “Swap”). The City seeks damages and/ or other remedies against JPMorgan Chase (among others) on the grounds of alleged “fraudulent and deceitful acts” and alleged breach of advisory obligations in connection with the Swap and the Bond, together with related swap transactions with other counterparties. The Firm has entered into a settlement agreement with the City to resolve the City’s civil proceedings. In March 2010, a criminal judge directed four current and former JPMorgan Chase personnel and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as well as other individuals and three other banks) to go forward to a full trial that started in May 2010. The verdict, rendered in December 2012, acquitted two of the JPMorgan Chase personnel and found the other two guilty of aggravated fraud with sanctions of prison sentences (that were automatically suspended under applicable law), fines and a ban from dealing with Italian public bodies for one year. In addition, JPMorgan Chase (along with other banks involved) was found liable for breaches of Italian administr ative law, fined €1 million and was ordered to forfeit its profit from the transaction, which totaled €24.7 million. JPMorgan Chase and the individuals plan to appeal the verdict, and none of the sanctions will take effect until all appeal avenues have been exhausted. Enron Litigation. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in two lawsuits seeking damages arising out of the Firm’s banking relationships with Enr on Corp. and its subsidiaries (“Enr on”). Motions to dismiss ar e pending in both of these lawsuits: an individual ac tion by Enron investors and an action by an Enron counterparty. A number of actions and other proceedings against the Firm previously were resolved, including a class action lawsuit captioned Newby v. Enron Corp. and adversary proceedings brought by Enron’s bankruptcy estate. FERC Matters. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) is investigating the Firm’s bidding practices in certain organized power markets. Additionally , in November 2012, the FERC issued an Order suspending a JPMorgan Chase energy subsidiary’s market-based rate authority for six months commencing on April 1, 2013, based on its finding that statements concerning discovery obligations made in submissions related to the FERC investigation violated FERC rules regarding misleading information. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of putativ e class action complaints relating to interchange in several federal courts. The complaints allege, among other claims, that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain other banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. All cases were consolidated in the United S tates District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings. In October 2012, Visa, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated and various United States financial institution defendants, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 319 Chase Bank, N.A., Chase Bank USA, N.A., Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC and certain predecessor institutions, en tered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) to resolve the claims of the U.S. merchant and retail association plaintiffs (the “Class Plaintiffs”) in the multi- district litigation. In November 2012, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement Agreement, which provides for, among other things, a cash payment of $6.05 billion to the Class Plaintiffs (of which the Firm’s share is approximately 20%), and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. The Settlement Agreement also provides for modifications to each cr edit card network’s rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. The rule modifications became ef fective in January 2013. The Settlement Agreement is subject to final approval by the Court. Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending three pending cases that allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. were inappropriately invested in securities back ed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs claim that JPMor gan Investment Management is liable for losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. In the case filed by Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and the case filed by Ambac Assurance UK Limited in New York state court, discovery is proceeding on claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence. The third case, filed by CMMF LLP in New York state court, asserts claims under New York law for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Trial of the CMMF action was completed in February 2013, and the Court’s decision is pending. Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Committee”) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $8.6 billion in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI’s bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s collateral requests hastened LBHI’ s bankruptcy. The Firm moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint in its entirety, and also moved to transfer the litigation from the Bankruptcy Court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In April 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued a decision granting in part and denying in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint seeking avoidance of the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008. The Court denied the Firm’s motion to dismiss as to the other claims, includin g claims that allege intentional misconduct. In September 2012, the District Court denied the transfer motion without prejudice to its renewal in the future, but stated that any trial would likely have to be conducted before the District Court. The Firm also filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion in claims (the “Clearing Claims”) against the estate of Lehman Brothers Inc. (“LBI”), LBHI’ s broker-dealer subsidiary. These claims have been paid in full, subject to the outcome of the litigation. Discovery is ongoing. LBHI and the Committee have filed an objection to the deficiency claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to the Clearing Claims, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for such claims in a commercially reasonable manner . The Firm responded to LBHI’s objection in November 2011. Discovery is ongoing. LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been C hapter 11 debtors have filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm has not yet responded to the amended deriv atives complaint and objection, and discovery has not begun. LIBOR Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, CFTC, SEC, and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission, UK Financial Services Authority, Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and bankin g associations around the world. The documents and information sought relate primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR ”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The F irm is cooperating with these inquiries. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class ac tions filed in various United States District Courts in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later , defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S . dollar LIBOR, Y en LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted Notes to consolidated financial statements 320 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report in loans, derivatives or other financial instrumen ts whose values are impacted by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Y en LIBOR, or Euroyen TIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seekin g treble damages. In 2011, a number of class actions were filed against LIBOR panel banks, includin g the Firm, asserting various federal and state law claims relating to the alleged manipulation of U.S. dollar LIBOR. These purported class actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United S tates District Court for the Southern District of New York before District Judge Buchwald, who appointed interim lead counsel for three proposed classes: (i) direct purchasers of U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instrumen ts in the over- the-counter market; (ii) purchasers of U.S. dollar LIBOR- based financial instrumen ts on an exchange; and (iii) purchasers of debt securities that pa y an interest rate linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The defendants moved to dismiss all claims in these three putative class actions and three related individual actions pending before the Court. The Court has not yet ruled on the defendants’ motions to dismiss. Since April 2012, a number of additional U.S . dollar LIBOR putative class actions and individual ac tions have been filed in various courts. Defendants have moved to transfer each of these cases to the consolidated action pending in the Southern District of New York. To date, all but three of these actions have been transferred. The actions that have been transferred are stayed until the Court rules on the defendants’ pending motions to dismiss. The Firm also has been named as a def endant in a purported class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which seeks to bring claims on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased or sold exchange-traded Euroyen futures and options contracts. The plaintiff has been granted leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, and defendants will have 60 days after the filing of that amended pleadin g to respond. Madoff Litigation. JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by the trustee (the “Trustee”) for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“Madoff”). The Trustee has served an amended complaint in which he has asserted 28 causes of action against JPMorgan Chase, 20 of which seek to avoid certain transfers (direct or indirect) made to JPMorgan Chase that are alleged to have been preferential or fraudulent under the federal Bankruptcy Code and the New York Debtor and Creditor Law. The remaining causes of action involve claims for, among other things, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, contribution and unjust enrichment in connection with Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. The complaint asserts common law claims that purport to seek approximately $19 billion in damages, together with bankruptc y law claims to recover approximately $425 million in transfers that JPMorgan Chase allegedly received directly or indirectly from Bernard Madoff’s brokerage firm. In October 2011, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted JPMorgan Chase’s motion to dismiss the common law claims asserted by the Trustee, and returned the remaining claims to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings. The Trustee appealed this decision and or al argument on the appeal was held in November 2012. The Firm is awaiting the Court’s decision. Separately, J.P. Morgan Trust Company (Cayman) Limited, JPMorgan (Suisse) SA, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Bear Stearns Alternativ e Assets International Ltd., J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp., J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA, and J.P. Morgan Markets Limited (formerly Bear Stearns International Limited) ha ve been named as defendants in lawsuits presently pending in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation pr oceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together , “Fairfield”), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions are based on theories of mistake and restitution, among other theories, and seek to recover payments made to defendants by the funds totaling approximately $155 million. Pursuant to an agreement with the Trustee, the liquidators of Fairfield have voluntarily dismissed their ac tion against J.P. Morgan Securities plc without pr ejudice to refiling. The other actions remain outstanding. In addition, a purported class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc to an already- pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The Court dismissed these complaints and plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm is a defendant in five other Madoff-related actions pending in New York state court and one purported class action in federal District Court in New York. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The Firm has moved to dismiss both the state and federal actions. The Firm is also responding to various governmental inquiries concerning the Madoff matter. MF Global. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was named as one of several defendants in a number of putativ e class action lawsuits brought by former customers of MF Global in federal District Courts in New York, Illinois and Montana. The lawsuits have been consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The actions alleged, among other things, that the Firm aided and abetted MF Global’s alleged misuse of customer money and breaches of fiduciary duty and was unjustly enriched by the transfer of certain customer segregated funds by MF Global. The Firm has entered into a tolling agreement with counsel for the customer class plain tiffs JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 321 and an individual plain tiff, pursuant to which the plaintiffs have agreed not to pursue any such claims against the Firm in these actions for so long as the tolling agreement remains in effect. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one of several defendants in a number of purported class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global’s publicly traded securities, including the securities issued pursuant to MF Global’s June 2010 secondary offering of common stock and February 2011 and August 2011 convertible note offerings. The actions have been consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In August 2012, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which asserts violations of the Securities A ct of 1933 against the underwriter defendants and alleges that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global’s financial position, in ternal controls and risk management, as such topics relate to its exposure to European sovereign debt. Defendants moved to dismiss in October 2012. Those motions remain pending. In June 2012, the Securities Investor Protection Act (“SIPA”) Trustee issued a Report of the Trustee’s Investigation and Recommendations, and stated that he is c onsidering potential claims against the Firm with respect to certain transfers identified in the Report. Discussions regarding possible resolution of potential SIPA Trustee claims and customer claims against the Firm are ongoing. The Firm has responded to and continues to respond to inquiries from the CFTC, SEC, SIPA Trustee and Bankruptcy Trustee concerning MF Global. Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Mortgage-Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates, Bear Stearns and affiliates and Washington Mutual affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their v arious roles as issuer , originator or underwriter in MBS offerings. These cases include purported class action suits, actions by individual purchasers of securities or by trustees for the benefit of purchasers of securities, an action by the New York State Attorney General and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of securities offerings. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the offering documents for securities issued by numerous securitization trusts c ontained material misrepresentations and omissions, includin g with regard to the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination. Ther e are currently pending and tolled investor claims involving approximately $170 billion of such securities. In addition, and as described below, there are pending and threatened claims by monoline insurers and by and on behalf of trustees that involve some of these and other securitizations. In the actions against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter of its own MBS offerings), three purported class actions are pending against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, and/ or certain of their affiliates and current and former employees, in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Motions to dismiss have been largely denied in these cases, although in c ertain cases defendants have sought to appeal aspects of the decision, and they are in various stages of litigation. A settlement of a fourth purported class action that is pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against Washington Mutual affiliates, WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp. and WaMu Capital Corp. and certain former officers or directors of WaMu Asset Acceptance Corp., has received final court approval. In addition to class actions, the Firm is also a defendant in individual actions brought against certain affiliates of JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as issuers (and, in some cases, as underwriters) of MBS. These actions involve claims by or to benefit various institutional investors and governmental agencies. These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the United States and are in various stages of litigation. In actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification fr om the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now defunct, such as in pending cases where the Firm has been named involving affiliates of IndyMac Bancorp. A settlement of a purported class action involving Thornburg Mortgage MBS offerings that was pending against the Firm has received preliminary court approval. The Firm may also be contractually obligated to indemnify underwriters in certain deals it issued. EMC Mortgage LLC (formerly EMC Mortgage Corporation) (“EMC”), an indirect subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and certain other JPMorgan Chase entities currently are defendants in nine pending actions commenced by bond insurers that guaranteed payments of principal and interest on certain classes of 19 different MBS offerings. These actions are pending in federal and state courts in New York and are in various stages of litigation. Certain JPMorgan Chase entities, in their capacities as alleged suc cessors in interest to Bear Stearns and EMC, have been named as defendants in a civil suit filed by the New York State Attorney General in New York state court in connection with Bear Stearns’ due diligence and quality control practices relating to MBS. The Firm or its affiliates are defendants in actions brought by trustees or master servicers of various MBS trusts and others on behalf of the purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. The first action was commenced by Deutsche Bank National T rust Company, acting as trustee for various Notes to consolidated financial statements 322 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report MBS trusts, against the Firm and the FDIC based on MBS issued by Washington Mutual Bank and its af filiates; that case is described in the W ashington Mutual Litigations section below. The other actions are at various initial stages of litigation in the New York and Delaware state courts, including actions brought by MBS trustees, each specific to one or more MBS transactions, against EMC and/ or JPMorgan Chase. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans, as well as indemnification of at torneys’ fees and costs and other remedies. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-r elated litigation, and the Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased such securities that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims. In addition, the F irm has received several demands by securitization trustees that threaten litigation, as well as demands by investors directing or threatening to direct trustees to investigate claims or bring litigation, based on purported obligations to repurchase loans out of securitization trusts and alleged servicing deficiencies. These include but ar e not limited to a demand from a law firm, as counsel to a group of purchasers of MBS that purport to have 25% or more of the voting rights in as many as 191 different trusts sponsored by the Firm or its affiliates with an original principal balanc e of more than $174 billion (excluding 52 trusts sponsored by Washington Mutual, with an original principal balanc e of more than $58 billion), made to various trustees to investigate potential repurchase and servicing claims. Further, there have been repurchase and servicing claims made in litigation against trustees not affiliated with the Firm, but involving trusts that the Firm sponsored. In April 2012, the New York state court granted the Firm’s motion to dismiss a shar eholder complaint against the Firm and two affiliates, members of the boards of directors thereof and certain employees, asserting claims based on alleged wrongful actions and inactions relating to residential mortgage originations and securitizations. The plaintiff has appealed the order. A second shareholder complaint has been filed in New York state court against current and former members of the Firm’s Board of Directors and the Firm, as nominal defendant, alleging that the Board allowed the Firm to engage in wrongful conduct regarding the sale of residential MBS and failed to implement adequate internal controls to prevent such wrongdoing. In addition to the above-described litigation, the Firm has also received, and responded to, a number of subpoenas and informal requests for information from federal and state authorities concerning mortgage-related matters, including inquiries concerning a number of transactions involving the Firm and its affiliates’ origination and purchase of whole loans, underwriting and issuance of MBS, treatment of early payment defaults, potential breaches of securitization representations and warranties, reserves and due diligence in connection with securitizations. In November 2012, the Firm settled with the SEC over its investigations of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Acceptance Corporation I relating to delinquency disclosures, and of Bear Stearns entities and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC relating to disclosures concerning settlements of claims against originators involving loans included in a number of Bear S tearns securitizations. Pursuant to the settlement, the named entities, without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering certain relief, including an injunction and the payment of approximately $296.9 million in disgorgement, penalties and interest. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia approved the settlement and entered the judgment in January 2013. The Firm continues to respond to other MBS-related regulatory inquiries. Mortgage Foreclosure-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorneys General of Massachusetts and New York have separately filed lawsuits against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry’s electronic mortgage registry. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the Massachuset ts action and the Firm has moved to dismiss the New York action. Six purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Firm relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. Two of the class actions have been dismissed with pr ejudice and one settled on an individual basis. Of the r emaining active actions, two are in the discovery phase and a motion to dismiss is pending in the remaining action. Additionally , a purported class action brought against Bank of America involving an EMC loan has been dismissed. Two shareholder derivative actions have been filed in New York Supreme Court against the Firm’s Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. These actions seek declaratory relief and damages. In July 2012, the Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the first-filed action and gave plaintiff 45 days in which to file an amended complaint. In October 2012, the Court entered a stipulated order consolidating the actions and staying all proceedings pending the plaintiffs’ decision whether to file a consolidated complaint after the Firm completes its response to a demand submit ted by one of the plaintiffs under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Civil Division of the United S tates Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm’s compliance with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration’s Direct Endorsement Program. The Firm is cooperating in that investigation. On January 7, 2013, the Firm announced that it and a number of other financial institutions en tered into a JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 323 settlement agreement with the OCC and the Federal Reserve providing for the termination of the Independen t Foreclosure Review programs that had been required under the Consent Orders with such banking regulators relating to each bank’s residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. Under this set tlement, the Firm will make a cash payment of $753 million into a settlement fund for distribution to qualified borr owers. The Firm has also committed an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure prevention actions under the settlement, which will be fulfilled through credits given to the Firm for modifications, short sales and other types of borrower relief. Municipal Derivatives Investigations and Litigation. Purported class action lawsuits and individual ac tions have been filed against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, as well as numerous other providers and brokers, alleging antitrust violations in the mark et for financial instrumen ts related to municipal bond offerings referred to collectively as “municipal derivatives.” In July 2011, the Firm settled with federal and state governmental agencies to resolve their investigations into similar alleged conduct. The municipal derivatives actions were consolidated and/ or coordinated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In December 2012, the District Court granted final approval of a settlement calling for payment of approximately $43 million. Certain class members opted out of the settlement, including 27 plaintiffs named in individual ac tions already pending against JPMorgan. In addition, civil actions have been commenced against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. In November 2009, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC settled with the SEC to resolve its investigation into those transactions. Following that settlement, the County filed an action against the Firm and several other defendants in Alabama state court. An action on behalf of a purported class of sewer rate payers has also been filed in Alabama state c ourt. The suits allege that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The complaints also allege that the Firm concealed these third- party payments and that, but for this concealment, the County would not have entered into the transactions. The Court denied the Firm’s motions to dismiss the c omplaints in both proceedings. In November and December 2011, the County filed notices of bankruptcy with the trial court in each of the cases and with the Alabama Supr eme Court stating that it was a Chapter 9 Debtor in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Subsequently, the portion of the sewer rate payer action involving claims against the Firm was removed by certain defendants to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In its order finding that removal of this action was proper, the District Court referred the action to the District’s Bankruptcy Court, where the action remains pending. Limited discovery has taken place in the County’s action and additional disc overy may take place in 2013. In September 2012, a group of purported creditors of the County initiated an adversary proceeding and filed a purported class action complaint alleging that certain warrants were issued unlawfully and were thus null and void and seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the Firm and other defendants involved in the Jefferson County financing transactions. The Firm, along with a number of other defendants, moved to dismiss the complaint in November 2012. Plaintiffs subsequently agreed to dismiss their tort claims seeking damages and are solely pursuing their claims relating to the validity of the warrants. The motion to dismiss these claims r emains pending. Two insurance companies that guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on warrants issued by the County have filed separate actions against the Firm in New York state court. Their complaints assert that the Firm fraudulently misled them into issuing insurance based upon substantially the same alleged conduct described above and other alleged non-disclosur es. One insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of nearly $1.2 billion and seeks unspecified damages in e xcess of $400 million as well as unspecified punitiv e damages. The other insurer claims that it insur ed an aggregate principal amount of more than $378 million and seeks recovery of $4 million allegedly paid under the policies to date as w ell as any future payments and unspecified punitiv e damages. In December 2010, the court denied the Firm’s motions to dismiss each of the complaints. The Firm has filed a cross- claim and a third party claim against the County for indemnity and contribution. The County moved to dismiss, which the court denied in August 2011. In consequence of its November 2011 bankruptcy filing, the County has asserted that these actions are stayed. In February 2012, one of the insurers filed a motion for a declaration that its action is not stayed as against the Firm or, in the alternative, for an order lifting the stay as against the Firm. The Firm and the County opposed the motion, which remains pending. Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage Litigation. The Firm is defending one purported and three certified class actions, all pending in federal courts in California, which assert that several JPMorgan Chase entities violated the f ederal Truth in Lending Act and state unfair business practice statutes in failing to provide adequate disclosur es in Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage (“ ARM”) loans regarding the resetting of introductory interest rates and that negative amortization was certain to occur if a borrower made the minimum monthly payment. With respect to the former Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns defendants who purchased Option ARM loans from third-party originators, plaintiffs allege that those entities aided and abet ted the original lenders’ alleged violations. Classes have been certified in three of the actions. In one of the certified class actions, the Firm has moved for decertification of the class and f or summary Notes to consolidated financial statements 324 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report judgment. The Firm was unsuccessful in seeking permission to appeal the remaining class certification decisions. Overdraft Fee/Debit Posting Order Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been named as a defendant in several purported class actions relating to its practices in posting debit card transactions to customers’ deposit accounts. Plaintiffs allege that the Firm improperly re-ordered debit card transactions from the highest amount to the lowest amount before processing these transactions in order to generate unwarranted overdraft fees. Plaintiffs contend that the Firm should have processed such transactions in the chronological order in which they were authorized. Plaintiffs seek the disgorgement of all overdraft fees paid to the Firm by plaintiffs since approximately 2003 as a result of the re-ordering of debit card transactions. The claims against the Firm have been consolidated with numer ous complaints against other national banks in multi-Distric t litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Firm reached an agreement to settle this matter in exchange for the Firm paying $110 million and agreeing to change certain overdraft fee practices. In December 2012, the Court granted final approval of the settlement. Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptc y proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid, on fraudulent transfer and preference grounds, certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMor gan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees and the parties have agreed to stay the action brought by the Receiver until after the Bankruptcy Court rules on the pending motions. Securities Lending Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in a putative class action asserting ERISA and other claims pendin g in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought by participants in the Firm’s securities lending business. The action concerns investments of approximately $500 million in Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Court granted the Firm’s motion to dismiss all claims in April 2012. The plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, and the Firm’s motion to dismiss this c omplaint is pending. Discovery has been stayed until the Firm’s motion to dismiss is decided. Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual’ s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National T rust Company, initially against the FDIC, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agr eements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual, Inc. (“WMI”) subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities f or alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. The District Court denied as premature motions by the Firm and the FDIC that sough t a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank’s claims. Discovery is underway. In addition, JPMor gan Chase was sued in an action originally filed in state court in Texas (the “Texas Action”) by certain holders of WMI common stock and debt of WMI and Washington Mutual Bank who seek unspecified damages alleging that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at a price that was allegedly too low. The Texas Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which ultimately gr anted JPMorgan Chase’s and the FDIC’s motions to dismiss the c omplaint, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court’s dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. Plaintiffs, who sue now only as holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt following their voluntary dismissal of claims br ought as holders of WMI common stock and debt, have filed an amended complaint alleging that JPMorgan Chase caused the closure of Washington Mutual Bank and damaged them by causing their bonds issued by Washington Mutual Bank, which had a total face value of $38 million, to lose substantially all of their value. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs’ claim that the Firm tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs’ bond contracts with Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closur e. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries ar e named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 325 is probable that such liabilit y has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The F irm evaluates its outstandin g legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Firm incurred $5.0 billion, $4.9 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, of litigation expense. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the futur e. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or wher e the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impac t related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial c ondition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMor gan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, dependin g on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. Notes to consolidated financial statements 326 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Note 32 – International operations The following table presents income statement-related and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business tr ansactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the clien t, the location from which the client relationship is managed, or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions ar e consistent with the allocations used f or the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 33 on pages 326–329 of this Annual Report.

Note 33 – Business segments The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. Ther e are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the pr oducts and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial in formation is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, on pages 76–77 of this Annual Report. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, see Business Segment Results on pages 78–79 of this Annual Report. Business segment changes Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2012, the Firm’s business segments have been reorganized as follows: Retail Financial Services and Card Services & Auto (“Card”) business segments were combined to form one business segment called Consumer & Community Banking (“CCB”), and Investment Bank and Treasury & Securities Services JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report 327 business segments were combined to form one business segment called Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”). Commercial Banking (“CB”) and Asset Management (“ AM”) were not affected by the aforementioned changes. A technology function supporting online and mobile bankin g was transferred from Corporate/Private Equity to the CCB business segment. This transfer did not materially affect the results of either the CCB business segment or Corporate/ Private Equity. The business segment information that follows has been revised to reflect the business reorganization retroactive to January 1, 2010.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 328 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2012 Annual Report Segment results The following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results for 2012, 2011 and 2010 on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; this non-GA AP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). Effective January 1, 2012, the Firm revised the capital allocated to each of its businesses, r eflecting additional refinement of each segment’s Basel III Tier 1 common capital requirements.

Client investment managed accounts: Assets actively managed by Chase Wealth Management on behalf of clients. The percentage of managed accounts is calculated by dividing managed account assets by total client investment assets. Contractual credit card charge-off: In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Ex amination Council policy, credit card loans are charged off at the earlier of: (i) the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or (ii) within 60 days from receiving notification about a specific event (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower). Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a thir d party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay by, or certain restructurings of the debt of, the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a cr edit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISD A”) Determinations Committee, comprised of 10 sell-side and fiv e buy-side ISDA member firms. Credit cycle: A period of time over which credit quality improves, deteriorates and then improves again (or vice versa). The duration of a credit cycle can vary from a couple of years to several years. CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e., Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security and is assigned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor’s.

LLC: Limited Liability Company. Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the L TV as of a certain date. The current estimated L TV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical ar ea (“MSA ”) level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised Glossary of Terms 334 loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all lien positions related to the property. Combined L TV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial r esults that includes reclassifications to pr esent revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segmen t and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of an y one contract. Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt -A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amoun t or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significan tly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans ar e subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans to customers with one or more high risk characteristics, includin g but not limited to: (i) unr eliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high L TV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. MSR risk management revenue: Includes changes in the fair value of the MSR asset due to mark et-based inputs, such as interest rates and volatility, as well as updates to assumptions used in the MSR valuation model; and deriv ative valuation adjustments and other , which represents changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to offset the impact of changes in the market-based inputs to the MSR v aluation model. Multi-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class. NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. Net charge-off rate: Represents net charge-offs (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NM: Not meaningful. Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equiv alents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock -based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends durin g the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holder s of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnin gs (distributed and undistributed) ar e allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Personal bankers: Retail branch office personnel who acquire, retain and expand new and existing customer relationships by assessing customer needs and recommending and selling appropriate banking products and services. Portfolio activity: Describes changes to the risk profile of existing lending-related exposures and their impact on the allowance for credit losses from changes in customer profiles and inputs used to estimate the allo wances. Pre-provision profit: Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to gener ate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Pretax margin: Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by Glossary of Terms 335 measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which managemen t evaluates the performance of AM against the performance of their respective competitors. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instrumen ts, private equity investments, and physical commodities used in mark et making and client-driven activities. In addition, Principal tr ansactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities includin g: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specified risk management purposes, primarily to mitig ate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives, including the synthetic credit portfolio. Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with FASB guidance. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Real assets: Real assets include investments in productive assets such as agricultur e, energy rights, mining and timber properties and exclude raw land to be developed for real estate purposes. Real estate investment trust (“REIT”): A special purpose investment vehicle that provides investors with the ability to participate directly in the ownership or financing of real-estate related assets by pooling their capital to purchase and manage income property (i.e., equity REIT) and/ or mortgage loans (i.e., mortgage REIT). REIT s can be publicly-or privately-held and they also qualify for certain favorable tax considerations. Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the wholesale lines of business. Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”): Risk-weighted assets consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and w eighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the estimated cr edit risk associated with the obligor or c ounterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on- balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk - weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable tr ading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk - weighted assets. Sales specialists: Retail branch office and field personnel, including Business Bankers, Relationship Managers and Loan Officers, who specialize in marketing and sales of various business banking products (i.e., business loans, letters of credit, deposit accounts, Chase Paymentech, etc.) and mortgage products to existing and new clients. Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the in tention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment. Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the r elated mortgage and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion. U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations: Obligations of agencies originally established or char tered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified b y the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury. Value-at-risk (“VaR”): A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment. Washington Mutual transaction: On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain of the assets of the bankin g operations of Washington Mutual Bank (“Washington Mutual”) from the FDIC.
