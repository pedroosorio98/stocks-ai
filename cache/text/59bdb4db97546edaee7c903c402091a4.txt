JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER 2010 NET INCOME OF $3.3 BILLION, OR $0.74 PER SHARE, ON REVENUE1 OF $28.2 BILLION  Investment Bank generated strong net income and Fixed Income Markets revenue - Ranked #1 in Global Investment Banking Fees - Credit costs were a benefit of $462 million, driven by repayments and loan sales  Solid results from other businesses, includi ng Asset Management, Commercial Banking and Retail Banking  Consumer credit trends for Chase portfolios showed improvement in delinquencies - Card Services credit costs included $1.0 billion reserve reduction - Home Lending credit costs included $1.2 billion reserve increase for Washington Mutual credit-impaired portfolios  Corporate results included $1.0 billion in trading and securities gains and $2.3 billion in additional litigation reserves, including those for mortgage-related matters  Balance sheet remained very strong: Tier 1 Capital of $131.4 billion, or 11.5%, and Tier 1 Common 1 of $104.0 billion, or 9.1% (estimated)  More than $145 billion in new credit provided during the quarter, with continued focus on preventing foreclosures: - 4.0 million new card, home equity, mortgage and auto loans - Small-business credit originations of $2.1 billion across all businesses - 64,000 permanent mortgage modifications approved during the quarter; more than 750,000 modifications offered and nearly 185,000 approved since beginning of 2009 New York, April 14, 2010 – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported first-quarter 2010 net income of $3.3 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Earnings per share were $0.74, compared with $0.40 in the first quarter of 2009. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter: “The Firm’s net income of $3.3 billion reflected another strong quarter for the I nvestment Bank, particularly in Fixed Income Markets, and continued solid pe rformance across Asset Management, Commercial Banking and Retail Banking. Unfortunately, these good results were partially offset by high losses in the consumer credit portfolios.” Regarding the balance sheet, Dim on said: “Our first-quarter earni ngs generated additional capital, resulting in a very strong Tier 1 Capital rati o of 11.5% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.1%. Total J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 firmwide credit reserves were more than $39 billion, or 5.6% of total loans 1. We continued to see delinquencies stabilize, and in so me cases improve, in our credit portfolios. Ultimately, the health of these portfolios will track the health of the economy.” Dimon further remarked: “We have continued to contribute to the economic recovery of small businesses and communities. Building on the efforts of the Obama Administration, we expanded our own efforts to support small businesses, la unching an initiative to increase small-business lending to $10 billion by the end of 2010. During th e quarter, we extended more than $2.1 billion in new small-business credit, with Business Banking originations nearly doubling from last year. As a company, we also aim to employ more people and create new jobs across the country and around the world, with plans to add nearly 9,000 new employees in the U.S. alone. “Our efforts to prevent foreclosures have produced significant results. Since the beginning of 2009, we have offered approximately 750,000 trial m odifications to struggling homeowners, of which nearly 25% were approved for permanen t modification. We approved 64,000 modifications during this quarter alone, a 146 % increase from last quarter. In addition, we recently announced our participation in the U.S. Government’s s econd-lien mortgage progr am known as 2MP. While these modification programs are complex to impl ement and take time to build momentum, we are beginning to see success and believe they could ultimately prevent millions of foreclosures.” Looking ahead to the remainder of 2010, Dimon concluded: “While the economy still faces challenges, there have been cl ear and broad-based improvements in underlying trends. We believe these improvements will continue and are hopeful they will gather momentum, resulting in a strong recovery. Regardless of the economic tre nds, our company continues to invest for the future, building a better franchise for our clients and customers.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts w ith the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: (a) for each line of business and the Firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis; and (b) for Card Services and the Firm as a whole, certain reclassification adjustments for periods prior to January 1, 2010 that assumed credit card loans securitized by Card Services remained on the Consolidated Balance Sh eet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance that required the Firm to consolidate its firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. As a result, reported and managed basis are equivalent for periods beginning after January 1, 2010. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 13 .

These results reflected strong net revenue, par ticularly in Fixed Income Markets, and a benefit from the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $8.3 billion, compared with $8.4 billion in the prior y ear. Investment banking fees increased by 5% to $1.4 billion, consisting of debt underwriting f ees of $728 million (up 23%), equity underwriting fees of $413 million (up 34%), and advisory fees of $305 million (down 36%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.5 b illion, compared with $4.9 billion in the prior year, reflecting strong results ac ross most products. Equity Markets revenue was $1.5 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the prior year, refl ecting solid client reve nue and strong trading results. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $53 million. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $462 million, compared with an expense of $1.2 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected lower loan balances, driven by repayments and loan sales. The allowance for lo an losses to end-of-period loans retained was 4.9%, compared with 7.0% in the prior year. The d ecline in the allowance ratio was due largely to the consolidation of asset-backed commercial paper conduits in accordance with new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2010. Net char ge-offs were $697 million, compared with $36 million in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were $2.7 billion, up by $946 million from the prior year and down by $763 million from the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $4.8 billion, flat to th e prior year, as lower performance-based compensation expense was largely offset by incr eased litigation reserves, including those for mortgage-related matters.

Discussion of Results: Retail Financial Services repor ted a net loss of $131 million, co mpared with net income of $474 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $7.8 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion, or 12%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $5.0 billion, down by $214 million, or 4%, reflecting the impact of lower loan and deposit balances, partially offset by a shift to wider-spread deposit product s. Noninterest revenue was $2.8 billion, down by $845 million, or 23%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income. The provision for credit losses was $3.7 billion, a decrease of $144 million from the prior year and $496 million from the prior quarter. Economic pressure on consumers continued to drive losses for the mortgage and home equity portfolios. The provi sion included an addition of $1.2 billion to the allowance for loan losses for further estimated deterioration in the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired portfolios. The prior-year and prior-quarter provisions included additions to the allowance for loan losses of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Home equity net charge- offs were $1.1 billion (4.59% net charge-off rate 1), compared with $1.1 billion (3.93% net charge- off rate 1) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $457 million (13.43% net charge-off rate1), compared with $364 million (9.91% net charge-off rate 1) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $459 million (3.10% net charge-off rate 1), compared with $312 million (1.95% net charge-off rate1) in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $4.2 billion, an increase of $71 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Retail Banking reported net income of $898 million, an in crease of $35 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year. Net revenue was $4.3 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Net interest income benefited from a shift to wider-spread deposit pr oducts, largely offset by a dec line in time deposit balances. The decrease in noninterest revenue was driven by dec lining deposit-related fees, predominantly offset by an increase in debit card income. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 The provision for credit losses was $191 million, compared with $325 million in the prior year. The prior-year provision reflected a $150 million in crease in the allowance for loan losses for Business Banking. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, flat compared w ith the prior year, as efficiencies from the Washington Mutual integration offset increases in sales force and new branch builds. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Checking accounts totaled 25.8 million, up 3% from the prior year and flat compared with the prior quarter.  Average total deposits were $333.9 billion, down 3% from the prior year, due to the maturity of time deposits acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction, and up 1% from the prior quarter.  Deposit margin was 3.02%, compared with 2.85% in the prior year and 3.06% in the prior quarter.  Average Business Banking and other lo ans were $16.9 billio n, down 8% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter; originations were $905 million, up 96% from the prior year and 35% from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of credit cards decreased 16% from the prior year, but increased 8% from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of investment products increased 35% from the prior year partially driven by significantly increased sales in the Washington Mutual footprint, and increased 2% from the prior quarter.  Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit in tangibles) was 58%, compared with 58% in the prior year and 55% in the prior quarter.  Number of branches was 5,155, down 1% from the prior year and flat compared with the prior quarter. Mortgage Banking & Other Consumer Lending reported net income of $257 million, compared with $730 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower noninterest revenue and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by the lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $1.9 billion, down by $818 million, or 30%, from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by an increase in net interest income, reflecting the impact of higher auto loan ba lances and wider auto loan spreads. Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to lower MSR risk management results and lower mortgage production revenue, partially offset by higher mort gage operating income. MSR risk management results were $152 million, compared with $1.0 bill ion in the prior year. Mortgage production revenue was $1 million, compared with $481 million in th e prior year, as a result of an increase in losses from the repurchase of prev iously-sold loans, a decline in new originations and narrower spreads. Mortgage operating revenue, which represents loan servicing revenue net of other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, was $502 million, up by $353 million. The increase was driven by other changes in the fair value of the MSR asset, partially offset by lowe r servicing revenue as a result of lower third-party loans serviced. The provision for credit losses, predominantly relate d to the auto and student loan portfolios, was $217 million, compared with $405 million in the prior year. The prior-year provision reflected a $150 million increase in the allowance for loan losses for student loans. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, up by $109 milli on, or 10%, from the prior year, driven by default-related expense, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage insurance expense.

Real Estate Portfolios reported a net loss of $1.3 billion, co mpared with a net loss of $1.1 billion in the prior year. The deterioration was driven by lower net revenue an d the higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $1.5 billion, down by $246 million, or 14%, from the prior year. The decrease was predominantly driven by a decl ine in net interest income as a result of lower loan balances, reflecting portfolio run-off, as well as narrower loan spreads. The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, co mpared with $3.1 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected an addition of $1.2 billion to the allowance for loan losses for further estimated deterioration in the Washington Mutual prime and option ARM purchased credit- impaired portfolios. The prior-year provision wa s driven by an addition of $1.4 billion to the allowance for loan losses. (For further detail, see RFS discussion of the provision for credit losses.)

Discussion of Results: Card Services reported a net loss of $303 million, compared with a net loss of $547 million in the prior year. The improved results were driven by the lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. End-of-period managed loans were $149.3 billion, a decrease of $26.9 billion, or 15%, from the prior year and $14.2 billion, or 9%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans were $155.8 billion, a decrease of $27.6 bill ion, or 15%, from the prior year and $7.4 billion, or 5%, from the prior quarter. Managed net revenue was $4.4 billion, a decrease of $682 million, or 13%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.7 billion, down by $793 million, or 18%. The decrease was driven by lower average managed loan balances (including run-off from the Washi ngton Mutual portfolio), the impact of legislative changes, and a decrease d level of fees, partially offset by wider loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $758 million, an increase of $111 million, or 17%. The increase was driven by a prior-year write-down of securitiza tion interests, partially offset by run-off from the Washington Mutual portfolio.

The current-quarter provisio n included a reduction of $1.0 billion to the allowance for loan losses, refl ecting lower estimated losses, partially offset by continued high levels of charge-offs.

Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $488 billion, up by $139 billion, or 40%, due to the effect of higher market levels on custody and brokerage balances, and custody inflows in the Private Bank.

Effectiv e January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new acc ounting guidance that required the firm to consolidate its firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. As a result, re ported and managed basis are e quivalent for periods beginning after January 1, 2010. See notes on page 13 for further explana tion of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP ba sis was $27,671 million, $23,164 mi llion and $25,025 million for the first quarter of 2010, fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2009, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $3.3 billion, up by $1.2 billion, or 55%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by the lower provision for credit losses and higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $28.2 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 5%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.4 bil lion, up by $2.9 billion. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions revenue, including higher trading revenue and higher private equity gains (compared with losses in the prior year), partially offset by lower MSR risk management results. Net interest income was $13.8 billion, down by $1.7 billion, or 11%, largely driven by lower loan balances. Partially offsetting these declines we re wider loan spreads and higher investment portfolio net interest income. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 The provision for credit losses was $7.0 billi on, down by $3.1 billion, or 30%, from the prior-year managed provision. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained1 was 5.64%, compared with 4.53% in the pr ior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $7.2 billion, compar ed with $8.5 billion, reflecting a lower addition to the allowance for credit losses, partially offset by a higher provision related to net charge-offs across most consumer portfolios. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $7.0 billion, compared with $5.7 billion, resulting in managed net charge-off rates 1 of 6.61% and 4.90%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $236 million, compared with an expense of $1.5 billion, reflecting a reduction in the allowan ce for loan losses due to repayments and loan sales, partially offset by a higher provision relate d to net charge-offs. Wholesale net charge-offs were $959 million, compared with $191 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.84% and 0.32%, respectively, mainly related to continued weakness in commercial real estate. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $19.0 billion at Ma rch 31, 2010, up from the prior-year level of $14.7 billion and down from the prior quarter by $722 million. Noninterest expense was $16.1 billion, up by $2.8 b illion, or 21%, reflecting increased litigation reserves, including those for mortgage-related matters. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Tier 1 Capital ratios were 11.5% at March 31, 2010 (estimated), 11.1% at December 31, 2009, and 11.4% at March 31, 2009.  Tier 1 Common ratios were 9.1% at Ma rch 31, 2010 (estimated), 8.8% at December 31, 2009, and 7.3% at March 31, 2009.  Headcount was 226,623, an increase of 7,054, or 3%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. For 2010 and 2009, the Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue and net in terest income for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a tax- equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments th at receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comp arability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax- exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted the new accounting guidance for consolidating VIEs and consolidated the assets and liabilities of its firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. The income, expense and credit costs associated with these securitization activities are now recorded in the 2010 Consolidated Statements of Income in the same classifications as for credit card loans that were not securitized. As a result of the consolidation of the securitization trusts, reported and managed basis are equivalent for periods beginning after January 1, 2010. Prior to January 1, 2010 the Firm’s managed basis presentation al so included certain reclas sification adjustments that assumed credit card loans securitized by Card Services remained on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. JPMorgan Chase used this concept of managed basis prior to January 1, 2010 to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio as operations were funded and decisions were made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based on such managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoin g risk monitoring are used for both loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and secur itized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chas e retained the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; acco rdingly, the customer’s credit performance affects both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. JPMorgan Chase believed that this managed basis information was useful to investors, as it enabled them to understand both the credit risks associat ed with the loans reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. b. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes purchased credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm’s balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of purchased credit-impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses applicable to these loans was $2.8 billion at March 31, 2010. c. Tier 1 Common Capital (“Tier 1 Common ”) is defined as Tier 1 Capital less elements of capital not in the form of common equity – such as qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 Common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 Common along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benef its (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. e. TSS firmwide revenue includes ce rtain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business, mainly CB, RFS and AM, related to customers who are also customers of those lines of business. f. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (b) For further discussion of managed basis, see Note a. on page 13. (c) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (d) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equi ty less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the Firm's use of equity and to facilitate comparisons with competitors. (e) The Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital (“Tier 1 Common”) i s defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of capital not in the form of common equity – such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. (f) Estimated. (g) Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new FASB guidance which amended the accounting for the transfer of financial as sets and the consolidation of VIEs. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the Firm consolidated its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts, Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and certain other consumer loan securitization entities, primarily mortgage-related, adding $87.6 billion and $92.1 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, and decreasing stockholders' equity by $4.5 billion.
