Asset Management had its twentieth consecutive quarter of positive net long-term client flows and had record loan balances, up 20%.” Dimon continued: “We have growing confidence in the economy – consumers, corporations and middle market companies are in increasingly good financial shape and housing has turned the corner in most markets – and we are doing our part to support the recovery. JPMorgan Chase provided credit and raised capital of over $450 billion for our clients during the first quarter of 2014, which included $5 billion for U.S. small businesses.” Dimon concluded: “As I said in my letter to shareholders this week, we will dedicate extraordinary effort in 2014 adapting to the new global financial architecture, and we will continue to make significant progress on our control agenda.

See notes on page 12 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $22,993 million, $23,156 million, and $25,122 million for the first quarter of 2014, fourth quarter of 2013, and first quarter of 2013, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.3 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 11 revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $23.9 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 8%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, down $1.8 billion, or 12%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $10.9 billion, down $202 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower loan yields and lower trading and investment securities balances, predominantly offset by higher investment securities yields, lower long term debt and deposit interest expense. The provision for credit losses was $850 million, up $233 million from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $807 million, compared with $545 million in the prior year. The current- quarter consumer provision reflected a $449 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.1 billion reduction in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer allowance release primarily reflects lower estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.42% and 1.92%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $43 million, compared with $72 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $13 million, compared with net charge-offs of $35 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.02% and 0.05%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.75%, compared with 2.27% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.5 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $9.7 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. Noninterest expense was $14.6 billion, down $787 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation in CIB and lower mortgage production and servicing expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1 was 9.5%. Headcount was 246,994, a decrease of 8,904, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) and return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of TCE. TCE and ROTCE are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, as well as facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors. d. Tier 1 common capital and the Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules are each non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the supplemental leverage ratio (“SLR”) under Basel III rules is a non-GAAP financial measure. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on Tier 1 common and the Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and the SLR under Basel III rules, see Regulatory capital on pages 161-165 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. e. The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. • The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. • Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the Firm did not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business performance; however, the Firm continued to present these non-GAAP measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB in those prior periods. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Consumer & Community Banking allocated equity includes $3.0 billion of operational risk capital held at the Consumer & Community Banking level related to legacy mortgage servicing matters. c. Consumer & Business Banking deposit rankings are based on the Firm's and peer disclosures as of the fourth quarter of 2013. d. A household is a collection of individuals or entities aggregated together by name, address, tax identifier and phone. Consumer & Business Banking households are households that have a personal or business deposit, personal investment or business credit relationship with Chase. Reported on a one-month lag. e. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios, in production expense in Mortgage Production, and in core servicing expense in Mortgage Servicing. f. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the fourth quarter of 2013. g. Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of Asset Management against the performance of its peers. h. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.
