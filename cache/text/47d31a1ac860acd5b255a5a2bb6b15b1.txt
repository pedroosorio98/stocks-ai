See notes on page 12 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $22.5 billion, $24.2 billion, and $23.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, third quarter of 2014, and fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $4.9 billion, down $347 million from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 11 revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $23.6 billion, down $560 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $12.2 billion, down $788 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $11.3 billion, up $228 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting lower interest expense, higher loan balances and higher investment securities yields, largely offset by lower loan yields. The provision for credit losses was $840 million, compared with $104 million from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $946 million, compared with $65 million in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $250 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.2 billion reduction in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer allowance release primarily reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquency trends in the residential real estate portfolio and the impact of the sustained improvement in the economy on the credit card portfolio. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.28% and 1.44%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $106 million, compared with an expense of $39 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $26 million, compared with $22 million in the prior year, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 0.03% for both periods. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.55%, compared with 1.80% in the prior year. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans retained1, excluding credit card, was 106%, compared with 100% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.0 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $8.4 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively. Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $143 million, or 1%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower noninterest expense in Mortgage Banking, predominantly offset by higher noninterest expense in the Corporate & Investment Bank. The current quarter noninterest expense included approximately $1.1 billion of legal expense, compared with approximately $847 million of legal expense in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained, and the allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans retained, exclude the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) and return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TCE and ROTCE are meaningful to management, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, as well as facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors. d. Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital and the CET1 ratio under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the U.S. final SLR rule, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 161-165 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and on pages 73-77 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014. e. The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. • The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the impact of consolidated Firm- administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. • ROE for the fourth quarter 2014 is calculated excluding legal expense. • Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the Firm does not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business performance, with the exception of certain refinements to net FVA and DVA in the fourth quarter 2014; however, the Firm continues to present these non-GAAP measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB in those prior periods. • The change in Fixed Income Markets revenue excludes the revenue decline related to business simplification, including the sales of Physical Commodities and Global Special Opportunities Group businesses. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Additional notes on financial measures: a. Core loans include loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. b. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. c. Consumer & Community Banking 2014 allocated equity includes $3.0 billion of capital held at the Consumer & Community Banking level related to legacy mortgage servicing matters. d. Consumer & Business Banking deposit rankings are based on FDIC 2014 Summary of Deposits survey per SNL Financial. e. The credit and debit volume metric is based on Nilson data as of 2013. f. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates.

As of December 31, 2014, and September 30, 2014, the ratios presented are calculated under the Basel III Advanced Transitional Approach. See footnote (a) on page 11 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement for additional information on Basel III. CET1 capital under Basel III replaced Tier 1 common capital under Basel I. Prior to Basel III becoming effective on January 1, 2014, Tier 1 common capital under Basel I was a non-GAAP financial measure. For further discussion of Tier 1 common capital, see page 11 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (f) The increase in average VaR during the three months ended June 30, 2014 was due to a change in the MSR hedge position in Mortgage Banking in advance of an anticipated update to certain MSR model assumptions. When such updates were implemented, VaR decreased to prior levels. The MSR model and assumptions are continuously evaluated and periodically updated to reflect recent market behavior. Mortgage Banking average VaR was $3 million, $3 million, $20 million, $5 million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and $7 million and $12 million for full year 2014 and 2013, respectively. For information regarding CIB VaR, see Corporate and Investment Bank on page 24 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (g) Included unsecured long-term debt of $207.5 billion, $204.7 billion and $199.4 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. (h) Effective with the fourth quarter of 2014, the Firm changed the methodology it uses to allocate preferred stock dividends to the lines of business. Prior period amounts for net income/(loss) for each line of business were revised to conform with the current allocation methodology. The Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and consolidated results of operations were not affected by this reporting change. For further discussion, see page 2 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (i) Estimated. (j) On May 20, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.40 per share On May 21, 2013, the Board increased the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.38 per share.
