(NYSE: JPM) today reported s econd-quarter 2012 net income of $5.0 billion, compared with net income of $5.4 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings per share were $1.21, compared with $1.27 in the second quarter of 2011. The Firm’s return on tangible common equity 1 for the second quarter of 2012 was 15%, compared w ith 17% in the prior year. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on financial results: “Importantly, all of our client-driven businesses had solid perfo rmance. However, there were several significant items that affected the quarter’s results – some po sitively; some negatively. These included $4.4 billion of losses on CIO’s synthetic credit po rtfolio, $1.0 billion of securities gains in CIO an d a $545 million gain on a Bear Stearns-related first-l oss note, for which the Firm now expects full recovery. The Firm’s results also included $755 mil lion of DVA gains, reflecting adjustments for the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads which, as we have consistently said, do not reflect the underlying operations of the Firm. The Firm also re duced loan loss reserves by $2.1 billion, mostly for the mortgage and credit card portfolios. These reductions in reserves are based on the same methodologies we have used in the past – the good n ews is that these reductions reflected meaningful improvements in delinquencies and estimated losses in these portfolios. We continue to maintain strong reserves.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Dimon continued: “Since the end of the first quarte r, we have significantly reduced the total syntheti c credit risk in CIO – whether measured by notional a mounts, stress testing or other statistical methods. The reduction in risk has brought the portfolio to a scale that allowed us to transfer substantially a ll remaining synthetic credit positions to the Investm ent Bank ∗. The Investment Bank has the expertise, capacity, trading platforms and market franchise to effectively manage these positions and maximize economic value going forward. As a result of the tr ansfer, the Investment Bank’s Value-at-Risk and Risk Weighted Assets will increase, but we believe they will come down over time. Importantly, we have put most of this problem behind us and we can now focus our full energy on what we do best – serving our clients and communities around the world.” Commenting further on CIO, Dimon said: “CIO will no longer trade a synthetic credit portfolio and will focus on its core mandate of conservatively in vesting excess deposits to earn a fair return. CIO’ s $323 billion available-for-sale portfolio had $7.9 billion of net unrealized gains at the end of the quarter. This portfolio has an average rating of AA +, has a current yield of approximately 2.6%, and is positioned to help to protect the Firm against r apidly rising interest rates. In addition to CIO, w e have $175 billion in cash and deposits, primarily invested at central banks.” “The Firm has been conducting an extensive review o f what happened in CIO and we will be sharing our observations today. We have already completely overhauled CIO management and enhanced the governance standards within CIO. We believe these e vents to be isolated to CIO, but have taken the opportunity to apply lessons learned across the Fir m. The Board of Directors is independently overseeing and guiding the Company’s review, includ ing any additional corrective actions. While our review continues, it is important to note that no client was impacted.” Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: “Our f ortress balance sheet remained strong, ending the second quarter with a strong Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 10.3%. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 7.9% at the e nd of the second quarter, after the effect of the final Basel 2.5 rules and the Federal Reserve’s recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.” Dimon concluded: “Through the depth of the financia l crisis and through recent events, we have never stopped fulfilling our mission: to serve clie nts – consumers and companies – and communities around the globe. During the first half of 2012, we provided $130 billion of credit to consumers. Over the same period we provided nearly $10 billion of c redit to small businesses, the engine of growth for our economy, up 35% compared with the same period l ast year. For America’s largest companies, we raised or lent over $720 billion of capital in the first six months to help them build and expand around the world. Even in this difficult economy, we have added thousands of new employees across the country – over 62,000 since January 2008. In 2011, we founded the “100,000 Jobs Mission” – a partnership with 54 other companies to hire 100,000 U.S. veterans by the year 2020. We have hired more than 4,000 veterans since the beginning of 201 1, in addition to the thousands of veterans who already worked at our Firm. I am proud of JPMorgan Chase and what all of our employees do every day to serve our clients and communities in a first-class way.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is prese nted on a managed basis. For more information about managed b asis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 14. The following discussion compares the second quarters of 2012 and 2011 unless otherwise noted. ∗ For now, CIO will retain a portfolio of approximately $11 billion notional amount of mark-to-market positions as an economic hedge for certain credit exposures of the investment securiti es portfolio and tail risk for the portfolio. This long protection (i.e., short credit) is simple, transparent and easy to explain and will likely be reduced over time. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The decrease was driven by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior year. Net revenue was $4.5 billion, a decrease of $236 mi llion, or 5%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.3 billion, down $176 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by narrower loan spreads, partially offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower net charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $60 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher amortization of direc t loan origination costs, partially offset by highe r net interchange income. The provision for credit losses was $734 million, c ompared with $944 million in the prior year and $738 million in the prior quarter. The current-quar ter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a $751 million reduction in the allowance for loan lo sses due to lower estimated losses. The prior-year provision included a $1.0 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The Credit Card net charge- off rate 1 was 4.32%, down from 5.81% in the prior year and 4.37% in the prior quarter; and the 30+ day delinquency rate 1 was 2.13%, down from 2.98% in the prior year and 2 .55% in the prior quarter. The net charge-off rate for the quarter would have been 4.03%1 absent a policy change on restructured loans that do not comply with their modified payment term s. These loans will now charge-off when they are 120 days past due rather than 180 days past due. Th is change resulted in a one-time acceleration of $91 million in net charge-offs in the current quart er only, and a permanent reduction in the 30+ day delinquency rate which is 0.10% for the current qua rter. The one-time acceleration of net charge-offs is offset by a reduction in the allowance for loan los ses. The Auto net charge-off rate was 0.17%, up fro m 0.16% in the prior year and down from 0.28% in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, an increase o f $108 million, or 5%, from the prior year, due to additional expense related to a non-core product that is being exited.

(**) On July 13, 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported that it will be restating its previously-filed interim financial statements for the first quarter 2012. See note 3 on page 15. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.0 billion, down by $471 million, or 9%, from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower net revenue, largely o ffset by lower noninterest expense and a lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $22.9 billion, down by $4.5 billion, or 16%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $11.6 billion, down by $3.9 billion, or 25%, from the prior year, due to $4.4 billion of principal transactions losses from a portfolio held by CIO and lower investment banking fees, partiall y offset by higher mortgage fees and related income. Net interest income was $11.3 billion, down by $616 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as well as lower trading asset balances, higher financing costs associated with mortgage-backed securities, and the runoff of higher-yielding loans, largely offset by lower other borrowing and deposit costs. The provision for credit losses was $214 million, d own $1.6 billion, or 88%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $171 million, down $1.8 billion from the prior year. Th e decrease in the consumer provision reflected a $2.1 billion reduction of the related allowance for loa n losses predominantly related to the mortgage and cr edit card portfolios as delinquency trends improved and estimated losses declined, and to a lesser exte nt, a refinement of our incremental loss estimates with respect to certain borrower assistance program s. Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $2.3 billion, compared with $3.0 billion in the prior year, resul ting in net charge-off rates of 2.51% and 3.25%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit lo sses was $43 million compared with a benefit of $117 million. The current quarter provision primari ly reflected loan growth and other portfolio activi ty. Wholesale net charge-offs were $9 million, compared with $80 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.01% and 0.14%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of- period loans retained 1 was 2.74%, compared with 3.83% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $11.4 billion at June 30, 2012, down from the prior-year level of $13.4 billion and dow n from the prior-quarter level of $12.0 billion. Noninterest expense was $15.0 billion, down $1.9 bi llion, or 11% from the prior year driven by lower noncompensation expense. The prior year noninterest expense included a total of $2.3 billion for additional litigation expense, predominantly for mo rtgage-related matters, and expense for the estimated costs of foreclosure-related matters. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Basel I Tier 1 common ratio 1 was 10.3% at June 30, 2012, compared with 10.3% 4 at March 31, 2012, and 10.1% at June 30, 2011.  Headcount was 262,882, an increase of 12,787, or 5%. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a re ported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which i s a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definiti on of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results an d includes certain reclassifications to present tot al net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a f ully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAA P financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income ta x impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within inco me tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-o f-period loans excludes the following: loans accoun ted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-imp aired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan los ses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net cha rge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 bi llion, $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion at June 30, 20 12, March 31, 2012, and June 30, 2011, respectively. In IB, the ratio f or the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period l oans is calculated excluding the impact of consolidation of Firm-admin istered multi-seller conduits effective on January 1, 2010, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the IB’s allowance coverage. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represents common st ockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equit y less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable int angible assets (other than MSRs), net of related de ferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firm’ s earnings as a percentage of TCE. In management’s view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as ana lysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, and in facilitating comparisons with peers. d. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common di vided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is def ined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, i nvestors and analysts to assess and compare the qua lity and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm use s Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and mon itor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, th e Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Cap ital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III.” T he Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the F irm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the applic ation of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Fi rm may make in the future to its businesses as a re sult of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm’s estima tes of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolv e over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of furthe r rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a k ey measure to assess the Firm’s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in o rder to enable management, investors and analysts t o compare the Firm’s capital under the Basel III capital standard s with similar estimates provided by other financia l services companies. The Firm’s understanding of the Basel II I rules is based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies. e. In Card Services & Auto, supplemental information i s provided for Card Services, to provide more meani ngful measures that enable comparability with prior perio ds. The net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benef its (excluding performance-based incentives), and o ther noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics inc lude certain TSS product revenue and liability bala nces reported in other lines of business related to customers who ar e also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, ma nagement reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary , in management’s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax e xpense divided by total net revenue, which is, in m anagement’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective peers. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Com mercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general pu rpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of 1Q12. e. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commit ments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses refle cts loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking, Card Services & Auto and Commerci al Banking. The amount of credit provided to not-fo r-profit and government entities, including states, municipaliti es, hospitals and universities, represents that pro vided by the Investment Bank. 3.
