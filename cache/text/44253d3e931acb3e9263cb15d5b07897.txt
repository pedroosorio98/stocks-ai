These results include a benefit from credit reserve releases of $5.2 billion that we do not consider core or recurring profits. We believe our credit reserves of $26 billion are appropriate and prudent, all things considered.” Dimon continued: “In Consumer & Community Banking, consumer spending in our businesses has returned to pre-pandemic levels, up 14% versus the first quarter of 2019. We are also seeing good momentum in T&E with spend up more than 50% in March versus February. Home Lending originations were very strong, up 40%, with almost 75% of consumer mortgage applications completed digitally, but we expect this to slow with the recent rise in interest rates. Loan demand remained challenged as Card outstandings remain lower despite spend recovering to pre-COVID levels. Deposits were up 32% and investments were up 44%. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, we maintained our wallet share, Global IB fees were up 57% and Commercial Banking generated IB revenue over $1 billion. Corporate clients continued to access capital markets for liquidity and repay revolvers. In Asset & Wealth Management, continued strong investment performance, growth in new products and advisor hiring led to net inflows of $48 billion into long-term products. Also, AWM has seen strong and steady loan demand primarily to support business growth and mortgages.” Dimon added: “We continue to make significant investments in products, people, and technology, all while maintaining credit discipline and a fortress balance sheet. We are fully engaged in trying to help solve some of the world’s biggest issues, and we announced a commitment to finance and facilitate $200 billion in 2020 to drive action on climate change and advance sustainable development. We remain committed to using our resources to drive inclusive solutions to support our employees, customers, clients and the communities we serve through these trying times. In the quarter, we extended credit and raised capital of $804 billion, as well as funded approximately $10 billion under the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program, for consumers and clients of all sizes around the world.” Dimon concluded: “With all of the stimulus spending, potential infrastructure spending, continued Quantitative Easing, strong consumer and business balance sheets and euphoria around the potential end of the pandemic, we believe that the economy has the potential to have extremely robust, multi-year growth. This growth can benefit all Americans, particularly those who suffered the most during this pandemic. If all of the government programs are spent wisely and efficiently, focusing on actual outcomes, the benefits will be more widely shared, economic growth will be more sustainable and future problems, like inflation and too much debt, will be reduced.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 1Q21 results included: n $5.2 billion of credit reserve releases Firmwide ($1.28 increase in earnings per share (EPS)) n $550 million contribution to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation ($0.09 decrease in EPS) n Excluding significant items2: 1Q21 net income of $10.6 billion, or $3.31 per share and ROTCE of 21% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $2.8 billion, or $0.90 per share n $4.3 billion of common stock net repurchases in 1Q215, 9 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $82.31, up 8%; tangible book value per share 2 of $66.56, up 10% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 3 of $206 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 13.1%; Advanced ratio3 of 13.7% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 6.7%, and without the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasuries and Federal Reserve Bank deposits 5.5%.3 OPERATING LEVERAGE n 1Q21 reported expense of $18.7 billion; reported overhead ratio of 58%; managed overhead ratio2 of 57% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $804 billion of credit and capital10 raised in 1Q21 n $69 billion of credit for consumers n $4 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $300 billion of credit for corporations n $417 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $14 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities n $10 billion of loans under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program in 1Q21 JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Reggie Chambers (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the first quarter of 2021 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue of $33.1 billion was up 14%. Noninterest revenue was $20.1 billion , up 39%, driven by higher CIB Markets revenue, higher Investment Banking fees, and the absence of losses in Credit Adjustments and Other and markdowns on held- for-sale positions in the bridge book 13 recorded in the prior year. Net interest income was $13.0 billion , down 11%, predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth. Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion , up 12%, predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expense and continued investments. The increase in expense also included a $550 million contribution to the Firm’s Foundation. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $ 4.2 billion driven by net reserve releases of $5.2 billion, compared to an expense of $8.3 billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net reserve builds of $6.8 billion. The Consumer reserve release was $4.5 billion, and included a $3.5 billion release in Card, reflecting improvements in the macroeconomic scenarios, and a $625 million reserve release in Home Lending primarily due to improvements in house price index ( HPI) expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off. The Wholesale reserve release was $716 million reflecting improvements in the macroeconomic scenarios. Net charge-offs of $1.1 billion were down $412 million, predominantly driven by Card.

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies . In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 82.31, $ 81.75 and $ 75.88 at March 31, 2021 , December 31, 2020 , and March 31, 2020 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. First-quarter 2021 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding credit reserve releases and the contribution to the Firm’s Foundation (collectively, “significant items”) are non-GAAP financial measures. The credit reserve releases represent the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. Excluding these significant items resulted in a decrease of $3.7 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $14.3 billion to $10.6 billion; a decrease of $1.19 per share to reported EPS from $4.50 to $3.31; and a decrease of 8% to ROTCE from 29% to 21%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
