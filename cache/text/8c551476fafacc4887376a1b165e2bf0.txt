(NYSE: JPM) today reported 2008 second- quarter net income of $2.0 billi on, compared with net income of $4.2 billion in the second quarter of 2007. Earnings per share of $0.54 were down 55% , compared with earnings per share of $1.20 in the second quarter of 2007. Current-quarter resu lts include the effect of merger-related items amounting to a net loss of $540 million (after-tax) re lated to the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., which closed on May 30, 2008. Excluding these item s, net income would have been $2.5 billion. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Offi cer, commented on the quarter: “Our earnings were down significantly due to th e unfavorable credit environmen t and market conditions. The Investment Bank took additional markdowns on le veraged loans and mortgage-related positions. Retail Financial Services experienced further de terioration in its home lending portfolio, which resulted in higher charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. However, the firm overall continued to maintain solid underlying business momentum. We had market share gains in Investment Banking fees and key product areas. Retail Financial Se rvices posted organic revenue growth of 15%, and all of our major business es produced growth in accounts, balances and volumes. Further positive resu lts in the quarter included record performance from both Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services.” Mr. Dimon added, “We also completed the highly complex Bear Stearns acquisition as planned. Through the truly remarkable partnership and efforts of our people in extremely difficult times, we made great progress towards full integration, while also significantly reduc ing our combined risk JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release positions. We now have an expanded platform to better serve our institutional clients – one which we fully expect will make our franchise stronger over time.” Mr. Dimon further remarked, “I am pleased with the strength of our balance sheet and capital positions, particularly in the context of the market challenges we have faced during the past year. During the quarter, we added $1.3 billion to our a llowance for credit losses (which now totals $13.9 billion) and maintained strong capital ratios.” Discussing the firm’s outlook, Dim on said, “Our expectation is fo r the economic environment to continue to be weak – and to likely get weaker – and for the capital markets to remain under stress. We remain conscious that since substantial risks still remain on our balance sheet, these factors will likely affect our business for the remainder of the year or longer. However, the firm has delivered underlying growth across most of our businesses, and w ith our substantial capital base we can continue to invest for the future. In spite of the environment, we are confident that we are building an increasingly strong and profitable company.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d JPMorgan Chase, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP resu lts and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis.

The lower results reflected increased noninterest e xpense, a decline in ne t revenue and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by the benefit of reduced deferred tax liabilities. Net revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of $328 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion (the second-highest quarter ever), down 9% from the prior year. Advisory fees of $370 million were down 34% from the prior year, reflecting reduced levels of activity. Debt underwriting fees of $823 million were down 1%, driven by a decline in loan syndication fees reflecting market conditions offset by higher bond underwriting fees. Equity underwriting fees were $542 million, up 6% from th e prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $2.3 billion, down $98 million, or 4%, from the prior year, driven largely by net markdowns of $696 million on leveraged lending funded and unf unded commitments, as well as mortgage- related net markdowns of $405 mill ion. These marks were partially offset by strong performance in rates, currencies, emerging markets, and credit trading, as well as gains of $165 million from the widening of the firm’s credit spread on certain st ructured liabilities. Equity Markets revenue was $1.1 billion, down $170 million, or 14% from the prior year, driven by weak trading results offset partially by strong client revenue and a gain of $149 million from the widening of the firm’s credit 2 2 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release spread on certain structured liabilities. Credit Portfolio revenue was $309 million, up $105 million, or 51% from the prior year, reflecting increased net interest income on higher loan balances. The provision for credit losses was $398 million, co mpared with $164 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects a weakeni ng credit environment. Net recoveries were $8 million, compared with net recoveries of $16 m illion in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to total loans retained was 3.19% for the current quarter, an increase from 1.76% in the prior year. Average loans retained were $76.2 billion, an in crease of $17.2 billion, or 29%, from the prior year, largely driven by growth in acquisition finance activity, in cluding leveraged lending, and a facility extended to Bear Stearns. Average fair value and held-for-sale loan s were $20.4 billion, up $5.6 billion, or 38%, from the prior year. Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, an increase of $880 million, or 23%, from the prior year, largely driven by higher compensation expense and the Bear Stearns acquisition.

Net revenue was $5.0 billion, an increase of $658 million, or 15%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $382 million, or 14%, due to higher loan ba lances, wider deposit spreads and higher deposit balances. Noninter est revenue was $2.0 billion, up $276 million, or 16%, driven by higher net mortgage servicing revenue, higher mortgage production revenue and increased deposit-related fees. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, as housing price decl ines have continued to result in significant increases in estimated losses, pa rticularly for high loan-to-value home equity and 3 3 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release mortgage loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $511 million (2.16% net charge-off rate), compared with $98 million (0.44% net charge-off ra te) in the prior year.

An a dditional provision for prime mortgage loans of $170 million has been reflected in the Corporate segment. Noninterest expense was $2.7 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 7%, from the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage production and servici ng expense, and investment in the retail distribution network. Regional Banking net income was $354 million, down $275 m illion, or 44%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $3.6 billion, up $320 million, or 10%, benefiting from higher loan balances, wider deposit spreads, higher depos it-related fees and higher depos it balances. The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $494 million in the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity and mortga ge portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up $29 million, or 2%, from the prior year , due to investment in the retail distribution network. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Checking accounts totaled 11.3 million, up 980,000, or 9%.  Average total deposits grew to $213.9 billion, up $6.6 billion, or 3%.  Average home equity loans were $95.1 billion, up $5.9 billion, or 7%.

Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were negative $394 million compared with negative $383 million in the prior year. Noni nterest expense was $649 million, an increase of $133 million, or 26%. The increase reflected hi gher mortgage reinsurance losses, higher production expense due in part to growth in orig ination volume, and higher servicing costs due to increased delinquencies and defaults. 4 4 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $250 million, a decline of $509 million, or 67%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses. End-of-period managed loans of $155.4 billion grew by $7.4 billion, or 5%, from the prior year and $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans of $152.8 billion increased $5.4 billion, or 4%, from the prior year and were flat from the pr ior quarter, reflecting seasonal patterning. The increase from th e prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans reflects organic portfolio growth. Managed net revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of $58 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up $56 million, or 2%, from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher average mana ged loan balances, an increased level of fees and wider loan spreads. These benefits were offset largely by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue of $764 million was flat compared with the prior year. Increased in terchange income (the re sult of charge volume growth of 6%), higher revenue from fee-based products , and higher securitization income were offset by increased rewards expense and higher volume-driven payments to partners (both of which are netted against interchange income). 5 5 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Worldwide Securities Services net revenue of $1.2 billion was a record, up $146 million, or 14%, from the prior year.

These benefits were offset partially by trading- related losses. The current-quarter provision for cr edit losses includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $170 million for prime mortgage (see Retail Financial Services’ discussion of provision for loan losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $170 million, a decrease of $135 million, or 44%, from the prior year. The decrea se reflected reduced litigation expense and the absence of prior-year merger expense related to the Bank One merger. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Private Equity portfolio was $7.7 billion, up from $6.5 billion in the prior year and $6.6 billion in the prio r quarter. The portfolio represented 8.9% of total stockholders’ equity less goodwill, up from 8.8% in the prior year and 8.3% in the prior quarter.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP bas is was $18,399 million, $16,890 million and $18,908 million for the second quarter of 2008, first quarter of 2008 and second quarter of 2007, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion, or 53%, from the prior year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $19.7 billion, a decrease of $141 million, or 1%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.5 billion was down $2.6 billion, or 22%, due to lower principal transactions revenue, which re flected net markdowns on levera ged lending funded and unfunded commitments and mortgage-related markdowns, and lower levels of private equity gains. In addition, the firm’s share of Bear Stearns’ losses from Ap ril 8 to May 30, 2008, and lower investment banking fees c ontributed to the decline in noninterest revenue. The decline was offset 10 10 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release partially by a gain on the sale of MasterCard shares. Net interest income was $10.2 billion, up $2.5 billion, or 33%, due to higher trading-related ne t interest income and higher loan and deposit balances. The managed provision for credit losses was $4.3 billion, up $2.2 billion, or 102%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses predominantly related to subprime mortgage, prim e mortgage and credit card loans, as well as higher net charge- offs. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, compared with $1.6 billion, resulting in a managed net charge-off rate of 3.08% a nd 1.90%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $505 million, compared with $198 millio n in the prior year, due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses reflecting the eff ect of a weakening credit environment and loan growth. Wholesale net charge-offs were $41 milli on, compared with net recoveries of $29 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.08% and a net recovery rate of 0.07%, respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $6.6 billion at June 30, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $2.6 billion. Noninterest expense was $12.2 billio n, up $1.1 billion, or 10%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher compensation expense, the acquisition of B ear Stearns (including merger- related costs) and higher mortgage production and servicing expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.1% at June 30, 2008 (estimat ed), 8.3% at March 31, 2008, and 8.4% at June 30, 2007.  Closed the acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. on May 30, 2008. The agreement called for each share of Bear Stearns common stock to be exchanged for 0.21753 shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock.  Headcount of 195,594 grew 15,930 since June 30, 2007, predominantly reflecting the Bear Stearns acquisition. 11 11 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business’ results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAA P results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concep t of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of th e entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performa nce will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-e quivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is pr esented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology al lows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. 12 12 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release JPMorgan Chase & Co.
