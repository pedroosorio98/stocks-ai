(b) Certain transaction costs, previously reported within net reve nue, have been reclassified to noninterest expense. Net reve nue and noninterest expense have been reclassified for all periods presented. Discussion of Results: Net income was a record $1.5 billion, up by $690 million, or 81%, compared with the prior year and up by $531 million, or 53%, compared with the prio r quarter. Earnings growth reflected record revenue and a lower provision for credit losse s, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was a record $6.3 billion, up 30% from the prior year, driven by record investment banking fees and record markets results. Invest ment banking fees of $1.7 billion were up 48% from the prior year driven by record debt and record equity underwriti ng as well as strong advisory fees. Debt underwriting fees of $864 million were up 52% driven by record bond underwriting fees and strong loan syndication fees, which benefited from both leveraged and high grade issuance. Advisory fees of $472 millio n were up 21%, with particular strength in the Americas. Equity underwriting fees of $393 million were up 85%, reflecting strength in common stock and convertible offerings in the Americas and Europe. Record Fixed Income Markets revenue of $2.6 billion was up 25% fro m the prior year, benefiting from improved results in commodities (compared with a weak prior-year quarter) as well as strength in credit and rate markets, partially offset by lower re sults in currencies. Record Equity Markets revenue of $1.5 billion increased 22%, benefiting from particul arly strong performance in Europe as well as strong derivatives performan ce across regions. Credit Portfolio revenue of $394 million was up 23%, due to the incorporation of an adjustment to the valuation of the firm’s derivative liabilities measured at fair value that reflects the credit quality of the firm, in conjunction with SFAS 157 (“Fair Value Measurements”), and higher trading revenue from hedging activities, partially offset by lower gains from loan workouts. Provision for credit losses was $63 million compared with $183 million in the prior year. The prior-year provision reflected growth in the loan portfolio. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, up by $511 m illion, or 15%, from the prior year. This increase was due to higher compensation expe nse, primarily performance-based, partially offset by the absence of expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R in the prior-year quarter. Highlights Include:  Ranked #1 in both Global and U.S. Equity and Equity-Related for the first time ever; #1 in Global Syndicat ed Loans; #2 in Global Announced M&A; #2 in Global Debt, Equity and Equity-Related; and #2 in Global Long-Term Debt based upon volume, according to Thomson Financial for year-to-date March 31, 2007.  Total average loans of $72.7 billion were flat from the prior year and down by $12.0 billion, or 14%, from the prior quarter. o Average loans retained of $59.9 billion were up by $6.2 billion, or 12%, from the prior year and down by $1.1 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter. o Average loans held-for-sale of $12.8 billion were down by $6.4 billion, or 33%, from the prior year and down by $11.0 billion, or 46%, from the prior quarter. o Approximately $12.0 billion of held-fo r-sale loans were reclassified to trading assets as a result of the adoption of SFAS 159 (“Fair Value Option”).  Allowance for loan losses to average loans was 1.76% for the current quarter, down from 2.08% in the prior year; nonperfor ming assets were $128 million, down 74% from the prior year and down 52% from the prior quarter.  Return on equity was 30% on $21 billion of allocated capital.

Net revenue of $4.1 billion was up by $343 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.6 billion was up 2% due to Th e Bank of New York transaction, higher home equity loans and deposit balanc es in Regional Banking, and wider loan spreads in Auto Finance. These benefits were offset partially by lower prime and subprime mortgage balances, the sale of the insurance business, lower auto loan and lease balances, and narrower spreads on deposits. Noninterest revenue of $1.5 billion was up by $288 million, or 24%. Results benefited from higher gain-on-sale income and th e reclassification of certain loan origination costs to expense (previously ne tted against revenue) due to the adoption of SFAS 159 (“Fair Value Option”) in Mortgage Banking; increases in deposit–related fee revenue; The Bank of New York transaction; and higher automobile operating lease revenue. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business, a charge resu lting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuity contracts, and th e absence of a prior-year loss related to auto loans transferred to held-for-sale. The provision for credit losses of $292 million was up by $207 million from the prior year. This increase was due to higher losses in the subprime mortgage portfolio and, to a lesser extent, increased provision in the home equity portfolio related to w eaker housing prices. These increases were offset partially by the reve rsal of a portion of th e reserves related to Hurricane Katrina. The firm’s exposure to subp rime mortgages is deemed manageable, with current quarter outstandings of $9.0 billio n and net charge-offs of $20 million (0.92% net charge-off rate), compared with $15.1 billion of loans and net charge-offs of $9 million (0.26% net charge-off rate) in the prior-year quarter . Given the firm’s current expectations for continued poor loss experience in subprime mortgages, the provision for credit losses was increased and standards for underwriting were tightened this quarter. In addition, since weaker home prices are expected to continue to affect losses in the home equity portfolio, underwriting standards were tightened and the allowance for this portfolio was increased during the quarter. Noninterest expense of $2.4 billion was up by $ 169 million, or 8%, primarily due to The Bank of New York transaction, the r eclassification of certain loan origination costs due to the adoption of SFAS 159, investments in the retail distribution network an d higher depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. These increases were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business. Regional Banking net income of $690 million was down by $67 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Net revenue of $3.1 billion was up by $52 million, or 2%. Results benefited from The Bank of New York transaction; growth in home equity loans and deposits; and increases in deposit- related fees. These revenue benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business, a continued shift to narrower-spread deposit products, and a charge resulting from accelerated surrenders JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 of customer annuity contracts. The pr ovision for credit losses was $233 million, up by $167 million, primarily related to highe r losses in the s ubprime mortgage portfolio and to a lesser extent increased provision in the home equity portfolio related to weaker housing prices. These increases were offset partially by the reversal of a portion of the reserves related to Hurricane Katrina. Noninterest expense of $1.7 billion was flat, as in creases due to The Bank of New York transaction and investments in the retail di stribution network were offset by the sale of the insurance business. Highlights Include:  Systems conversion and rebranding successfully completed for the 339 branches acquired from The Bank of New York, adding 1.2 million New York Tri-state deposit accounts to the Chase platform.  Checking accounts of 10.1 million were up by 1.2 million, or 13%, from the prior year (including approximate ly 615,000 accounts acquired from The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006), and up by 141,000, or 1%, from the prior quarter.  Average total deposits increased to $206.5 billion, up by $21.8 billion, or 12%, from the prior year (including approximately $11.5 billion of deposits acquired from The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006), and up 3% from the prior quarter.  Number of branches increased to 3,071, up by 433 from the prior year (including 339 acquired from The Bank of New York), and down by 8 from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of credit cards increased 17% from the prior year.  Branch sales of investment products in creased 35% from the prior year and 17% from the prior quarter.  Business Banking loan originations of $1.7 billion were up 30% from the prior year and 8% from the prior quarter.  Overhead ratio (excluding amortizat ion of core deposit intangibles) decreased to 52% from 54% in the prior year.  Average home equity loans of $86.3 bi llion were up by $12.2 billion from the prior year.  Prime mortgage loans of $19.4 billion we re transferred to Treasury within the Corporate segment. Although the loan s, together with the responsibility for the investment management of the portfolio, were transferred to Treasury, the transfer has no impact on the financial results of Regional Banking. Mortgage Banking net income was $84 million compared with $39 million in the prior year. Net revenue of $604 million was up by $216 million, or 56%, from the prior year. Revenue comp rises production revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue was $400 million, up by $181 million, reflecting higher gain-on-sale income and the reclassi fication of certain loan origination costs to expense (previously nette d against revenue) due to the adoption of SFAS 159. Net mortgage servicing revenue, which in cludes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $204 million compared with $169 million in the prior year. Lo an servicing revenue of $601 million increased by $41 million on a 13% increase in third-party loans serviced.

News Release 6 the asset against the realization of servicing cash flows, were negative $378 million. Noninterest expense was $468 million, up by $144 million, or 44%, reflecting the reclassification of certain loan originati on costs due to the adoption of SFAS 159 and higher compensation expense reflecting hi gher loan origina tions and a greater number of loan officers. Highlights Include:  Mortgage loan originations of $34. 1 billion were up 21% from the prior year and 10% from the prior quarter.  Total third-party mortgage loans serv iced were $546.1 billion, an increase of $62.0 billion, or 13%, from the prior year. Auto Finance net income of $85 million was flat compared with the prior year. Net revenue of $410 million was up by $75 million, or 22%, reflecting the absence of a prior-year $50 million pretax loss related to auto loans transferred to held-for- sale, higher automobile operating lease revenue, and wider loan spreads on lower loan and direct finance lease balances. The provision for credit losses was $59 million, an increase of $40 million from the prior year, primarily reflecting a reduction of the allowance for credit losses in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $210 million increased by $34 million, or 19 %, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Highlights Include:  Average loan receivables of $39.4 billi on declined 4% from the prior year and increased 2% from the prior quarter.  Average lease-related assets of $3.1 b illion declined 38% from the prior year and 9% from the prior quarter.  The net charge-off ratio increased to 0.59% from 0.46% in the prior year.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Net managed revenue was $3.7 billion, flat as comp ared with the prior year. Net interest income of $3.0 billion was down by $24 million, or 1%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher charge-offs, wh ich resulted in increased reve nue reversals in the current quarter and higher cost of funds on balance growth in promotional, introductory and transactor loan balances. These declines were offset pa rtially by higher average managed loan balances and increased fees. Compared with the prio r quarter, net interest income was up by $47 million, or 2%, driven by higher average mana ged loan balances, including growth in nonpromotional balances. Noninterest reve nue of $691 million was up by $19 million, or 3%, from the prior year.

Compared with the prior quarter, noninterest revenue was down by $117 million, or 14%, driven by seasonally lower net interchange income. The managed provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, up by $213 million, or 21%, from the prior year.

Compared with the prior qua rter, the managed provisi on for credit losses was down by $52 million, or 4%, which reflected an $85 million reduction in the allowance for credit losses, partially offset by a higher level of contractual charge-offs.

The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.07%, down from 3.10% in the prior year and 3.13% in the prior quarter.

The increase was due to higher compensation and in creased minority interest expense related to Highbridge Capital Management, partially offset by the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R. Highlights Include:  Pretax margin (2) was 36%, up from 31% in the prior year.  Assets under Supervision were $1.4 tr illion, up 17%, or $198 billion, from the prior year.  Assets under Management were $1.1 trillion, up 21%, or $180 billion, from the prior year, including growth of 47%, or $35 billion, in alternative assets.  Assets under Management net inflows were $19 billion for first-quarter 2007.  Assets under Management that were ranked in the top two quartiles for investment performance over the past three years were 76%, similar to the level at the end of the prior quarter.  Customer assets in 4 and 5 Star rate d funds were 61%, up from 58% at the end of the prior quarter.  Average loans of $25.6 billion were up by $1.2 billion, or 5%, from the prior year. Loans in the current quarter reflected the transfer of $5.3 billion of prime mortgage loans to Treasur y within the Corporate segment. Although the loans, together with the responsibil ity for the investment management of the portfolio, were tran sferred to Treasury, the transfer has no impact on the financial results of Asset Management.  Average deposits of $54.8 billion were up by $6.8 billion, or 14%, from the prior year.

Prior to the second quart er of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Tr easury & Securities Services. Discussion of Results:(see note (a,b) above) Net income was $631 million compared with a net loss of $366 million in the prior year and net income of $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. Compared with the prior year, results benefited from higher private equity gain s and improved net interest income. In comparison with the prior quarter, the lower results primarily refl ected the absence of both a $622 million gain on the sale of the Corporate Trust business and the benefit of $359 million of tax audit resolutions. Net revenue was $1.3 billion compared with negative $404 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by the Pr ivate Equity and Treasury segments. Private equity gains were $1.3 billion compared with $237 million in the prior year, benefiting from a higher level of realized gains, a fair value adjustment on nonpublic investments of $464 million resulting from the adoption of SFAS 157 (“Fair Value Measurements”), and the reclassification of certain private equity carried interest to comp ensation expense. Treasury’s results benefited from a $380 million increase in net interest income due to improved net interest spread, as well as the absence of $158 million of securities losses in prior year. Noninterest expense was $354 million, up from $335 million in the prior year, reflecting the reclassification of certain priv ate equity carried interest to compensation expense and lower recoveries related to certain material litigation, primarily offset by business efficiencies and the absence of prior-year expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R. Discontinued operations include the related balance sheet and income statement activity of selected corporate trust businesses sold to The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, these corporate trus t businesses were reported in Treasury & Securities Services. Net income from discontinued operations was $54 million in the prior year and $620 million in the prior quarter, which included a $622 million after-tax gain on sale. Highlights Include:  Private Equity portfolio was $6.4 b illion, up from $6.3 billion in the prior year and up from $6.1 billion in the prio r quarter. The portfolio represented 8.8% of stockholders’ equity less goodwill, down from 9.7% in the prior year and up from 8.6% in the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(b) As a result of the adoption on January 1, 2007, of SFAS 157 ("Fa ir Value Measurements"), the fi rm recognized a benefit in t he current quarter of $166 million related to the incor poration of an adjustment to the valua tion of the firm's derivative liabilities and other liabilities measured at fair value that reflects the credit quality of the firm and a benefit of $464 million related to valuation adjustme nts on nonpublic private equity investments. (c) Certain transaction costs, previously reported within net re venue, have been reclassified to noninterest expense. Net reve nue and noninterest expense have been reclassified for all periods presented. (d) Discontinued operations include the rela ted balance sheet and income statement ac tivity of selected corporate trust busines ses sold to The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quart er of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Tr easury & Securities Services. Discussion of Results: Net income was $4.8 billion, up by $1.7 billion, co mpared with $3.1 billion in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher ma naged revenue, partially offset by increased noninterest expense and higher managed provision for credit losses. Net managed revenue was $19.7 billion, up by $3.9 billion, or 25%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $12.2 billion was up by $3.0 billion, or 33%, reflecting the following: very strong private equity gains (including th e impact of adoption of SFAS 157 (“Fair Value Measurements”)); record markets revenue in th e Investment Bank; reco rd investment banking fees; increased asset management, administ ration, and commissions revenue; and improved mortgage fees (including the impact of adop tion of SFAS 159 (“Fair Value Option”)). Net interest income was $7.5 billion, up by $889 m illion, or 13%, due to improved trading net interest income; an improvement in the Corporat e segment’s net interest spread; an increase in consumer loans; the impact of The Bank of New York; and higher wholesale liabilities and consumer deposits. This increase was offset par tially by a shift to narrower–spread consumer loans and deposits; and a shift to narrower–spread wholesale liabilities and loans. The managed provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion, up by $321 million, or 25%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $77 million for the quarter compared with a provision of $179 million in the prior year. The prior-year provision reflected growth in the loan portfolio. Wholesale net recoveries were $6 million in the current quarter compared with net recoveries of $20 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rates of 0.02% and 0.06%, respectively. The total consumer manage d provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. Th e prior year benefited from a lower level of credit card net charge-offs, which reflected a low level of bankruptcy losses following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase from last year also reflects higher charge-offs and additions to the allowance for credit losses related to the subprime mortgage and home equ ity loan portfolios. The firm had total nonperforming assets JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 of $2.4 billion at March 31, 2007, up by $73 million, or 3%, from the prior-year level of $2.3 billion. Noninterest expense was $10.6 billion, up by $848 million, or 9%, from the prior year. Expense increased due to higher compensation expense, primarily incentive-based. In addition, expense growth was also driven by acqui sitions and investments, as well as lower insurance recoveries related to certain material litigation. The increase in expense was offset partially by the absence of a prior-year expens e from the adoption of SFAS 123R, as well as business divestitures and expense efficiencies. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio wa s 8.5% at March 31, 2007 (estimated), 8.7% at December 31, 2006, and 8.5% at March 31, 2006.  During the quarter, $4.0 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 80.9 million shares purchase d at an average price of $49.45 per share.  Headcount of 176,314 increased by 1,954 since December 31, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 Other financial information • Common stock dividend: The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per share on the outstanding shares of the corporation’s common stock, an increase of $0.04 per share, or 12%. The dividend is payable on July 31, 2007, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 6, 2007. On April 30, 2007, the firm will pay its previously declared quarterly common stock dividend of $0.34 per share to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2007. • Common Stock Repurchase Program: The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of the firm’s common shares. The new author ization commences April 19, 2007, and replaces the firm’s previous $8 billion repurchase program authorized on March 21, 2006. As of the close of business on April 17, 2007, there was approximately $850 million remaining on the March 2006 authorization. The new authorization will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact number of shares purchased will depend on market conditions and alternative investment opportunities. The new repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. • Merger savings and cost related : For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, approximately $720 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualiz ed rate of $2.9 billion, in line with management’s target for the year. Management estimates that annualized savings will be approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007. Merger costs of $62 million were expensed during the first quarter of 2007, bringing the total amount incurred to $3.5 billion (i ncluding capitalized costs) since th e beginning of 2004. Management currently expects total merger costs (including costs associated with The Bank of New York transaction) will be approximately $3.8 billion. The remaining merger costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2007. • Accounting Developments: FASB Statement No. 157 (“Fair Value Measurements”): JPMorgan Chase chose early adoption for Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fa ir Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. SFAS 157 nullifies the guidance in EITF 02-3, which required deferral of profit at inception of a derivative transaction in the absence of observable data supporting the valuation technique. The standard also eliminates large position discounts for financial instruments quoted in active markets and requires consideration of the firm's own credit quality when valuing liabilities. The adoption primarily affected the Investment Bank and Private Equity business within Corporate. FASB Statement No. 159 (“Fair Value Option”): JPMorgan Chase early adopte d Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, Fair Value Option, effective January 1, 2007. SFAS 159 provides the option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments and written loan commitments. Under SFAS 159, fair value is used for both the initial and subsequent measurement of the designated assets, liabilities and commitments, with the changes in value recognized in ear nings. The primary elections related to structured notes and loans warehoused in the Investment Bank, and to prime mortgage loans held in warehouse in Retail Financial Services. FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”): JPMorgan Chase adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the re cognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The firm applied FIN 48 to all of its income tax positions as of January 1, 2007, under the transition provision of the Interpretation. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 16 The table below summarizes the impact to 2007 first-quarter net income and equity as a result of the implementation of these accounting standards. 1Q07 Accounting Items ($ millions) Implementation impacts Pretax Income After-tax Income After-tax Equity SFAS 157 – Fair value measurements o EITF 02-3 nullification $287 o Nonperformance risk (IB) $166 $103 o Nonpublic private equity (Corporate) $464 $288 SFAS 159 – Fair value option $199 FIN 48 – Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes $436 Total implementation impact $630 $391 $922 FASB Statement No. 123R (“Share-Based Payment”): JPMorgan Chase adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), (“Share-Based Payment”) as of January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires that stock compensation granted to retirement-eligible employees be fully expensed at, or prior to, the time of grant rather than amortized over the vesting period. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006, the firm expensed the full amount of the compensation expense associated with grants of restrict ed stock made in January 2006 to retirement-eligible employees. In addition, during the first quarter of 2006, the firm began to accrue the estimated cost of grants expected to be awarded in January 2007 to retirement-eligible employees. Awards granted to retirement- eligible employees prior to January 1, 2006, have not been accelerated and will continue to be amortized over the original vesting periods. The incremental expense incurred during 2006 was noncash charges and represented accelerated recognition of costs that would have been incurred in future periods. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines’ of business results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans record ed on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase re tains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; acco rdingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans a nd the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans report ed on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allo ws management to assess the compar ability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (first quarter of 2007) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 17 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
