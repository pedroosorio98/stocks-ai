DGX or any other systems which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and the A100X are also covered by the new license requirement. The license requirement also includes any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system that includes those circuits. A license is required to export technology to support or develop covered products. The USG indicated that the new license requirement will address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a &#8216;military end use&#8217; or &#8216;military end user&#8217; in China and Russia. The Company does not sell products to customers in Russia. The new license requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete its development of H100 in a timely manner or support existing customers of A100 and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of China. The Company is engaged with the USG and is seeking exemptions for the Company&#8217;s internal development and support activities. In addition, the Company is engaging with customers in China and is seeking to satisfy their planned or future purchases of the Company&#8217;s Data Center products with products not subject to the new license requirement. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirement, the Company may seek a license for the customer but has no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner. The Company&#8217;s outlook for its third fiscal quarter provided on August 24, 2022 included approximately $400 million in potential sales to China which may be subject to the new license requirement if customers do not want to purchase the Company&#8217;s alternative product offerings or if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers. Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K including statements regarding the Company&#8217;s financial outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023; the Company&#8217;s engagement with the USG seeking exemptions for the Company&#8217;s internal development and support activities; the Company&#8217;s intent to seek licenses for sales to customers of products subject to the new license requirement; and the Company&#8217;s engagement with customers to satisfy their planned purchases of the Company&#8217;s Data Center products with products not subject to the new license requirement are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners&#8217; products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences or demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems; as well as other factors detailed from time to time in the most recent reports NVIDIA files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including, but not limited to, its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
