Last month, we announced a 10% increase to the common dividend. Our exceptionally high CET1 capital ratio of 15.0% and peer-leading returns provide us with the capacity and flexibility to both reinvest for growth and maintain an attractive capital-return profile, without compromising our fortress balance sheet.” Dimon continued: “This quarter, NII declined 4% sequentially, and as expected, NII ex. Markets declined 2% sequentially due to deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances, mostly in CCB. Looking ahead, we expect normalization to continue for both NII and credit costs.” Dimon continued: “Our lines of business saw strong underlying performance. In CCB, client investment assets were up 25% excluding First Republic, and we continued to add new customers. In CIB, IB fees increased 21%, reflecting improved DCM and ECM activity. In CB, we saw strong growth in Payments fees and onboarded a significant number of new client relationships. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees were up 14%, with continued strong net inflows.” Dimon added: “Many economic indicators continue to be favorable. However, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces. First, the global landscape is unsettling – terrible wars and violence continue to cause suffering, and geopolitical tensions are growing. Second, there seems to be a large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue. And finally, we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative tightening on this scale. We do not know how these factors will play out, but we must prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments to ensure that we can consistently be there for clients.” Dimon concluded: “We continue to be a pillar of strength for our clients, communities and markets across the world – while also delivering for shareholders. This quarter, we grew customers, continued to position the Firm for the future, maintained our fortress principles, raised the dividend and played a critical role in driving economic growth by extending credit and raising capital totaling more than $655 billion.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN 1Q24 RESULTS n $725 million increase to the estimated FDIC special assessment in Corporate ($0.19 decrease in EPS11) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.3 billion or $1.15 per share n $2.0 billion of common stock net repurchases12 n Net payout LTM12,13 of 42% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $106.81, up 13%; tangible book value per share2 of $88.43, up 15% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $258 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 15.0%; Advanced ratio3 of 15.3% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.1% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n More than $655 billion of credit and capital14 raised in 1Q24, reflecting approximately n $55 billion of credit for consumers n $10 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $575 billion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $15 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-2438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the first quarter of 2024 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue was $42.5 billion, up 8%, or up 4% excluding First Republic. Net interest income (“NII”) was $23.2 billion, up 11%, or up 5% excluding First Republic. NII excluding Markets 2 was $23.0 billion, up 10%, or up 4% excluding First Republic, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, as well as higher revolving balances in Card Services , largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. Noninterest revenue was $19.3 billion, up 5%, or up 3% excluding First Republic. The current quarter reflected higher asset management fees and higher Investment Banking fees, predominantly offset by lower CIB Markets noninterest revenue. The prior-year quarter reflected higher net investment securities losses in Corporate, largely offset by net investment valuation gains in AWM. Noninterest expense was $22.8 billion, up 13%, or up 9% excluding First Republic, driven by higher compensation, including an increase in employees, and a $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment to reflect the FDIC’s revised estimated losses. The provision for credit losses was $ 1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.0 billion and a net reserve release of $72 million. The net reserve release included a $142 million net release in Wholesale and a $44 million net build in Consumer. Net charge-offs of $2.0 billion were up $819 million, predominantly driven by Card Services. The prior-year provision was $2.3 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a net reserve build of $1.1 billion. Net income attributable to First Republic was $668 million. This reflected $1.3 billion of net interest income, $315 million of noninterest revenue, $806 million of noninterest expense and a net benefit to the provision for credit losses of $31 million.

Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 7%, or up 1% excluding First Republic. Banking & Wealth Management net revenue was $10.3 billion, up 3%, or down 4% excluding First Republic, driven by lower net interest income, partially offset by higher asset management fees . The decline in net interest income was primarily driven by lower deposit balances and deposit margin compression . Home Lending net revenue was $1.2 billion , up 65%, or up 10% excluding First Republic, predominantly driven by higher net interest income and higher production revenue. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.1 billion , up 8%, driven by higher Card Services net interest income on higher revolving balances, partially offset by higher amortization related to new account origination costs in Card Services and lower auto operating lease income. Noninterest expense was $9.3 billion , up 15%, or up 9% excluding First Republic, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily for bankers and advisors as well as technology, in addition to continued investments in marketing. The provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.9 billion and a net reserve build of $34 million, consisting of $1 53 million in Card Services, predominantly offset by a net release of $125 million in Home Lending, primarily due to improvements in the outlook for home prices. The net reserve build in Card Services was primarily due to seasoning of newer vintages, largely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. Net charge-offs of $1.9 billion were up $827 million, predominantly driven by continued normalization in Card Services. The prior-year provision was $1.4 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a net reserve build of $350 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $106.81, $ 104.45 and $ 94.34 at March 31, 2024 , December 31, 2023 , and March 31, 2023 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of CIB’s Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K. d. First-quarter 2024 net income and earnings per share excluding the $725 million increase to the estimated FDIC special assessment are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding this item resulted in an increase of $550 million (after tax) to reported net income from $13.4 billion to $14.0 billion and an i ncrease of $0.19 per share to reported EPS from $4.44 to $4.63. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
