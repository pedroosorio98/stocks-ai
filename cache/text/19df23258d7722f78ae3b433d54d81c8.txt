Not just a superfast chip – accelerated computing is a full-stack combination of: • Chip(s) with specialized processors • Algorithms in acceleration libraries • Domain experts to refactor applications To speed-up compute-intensive parts of an application. A full-stack approach: silicon, systems, software For example: • If 90% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100x, the application is sped up 9x • If 99% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100x, the application is sped up 50x • If 80% of the runtime can be accelerated by 500x, or even 1000x, the application is sped up 5x Amdahl’s law: The overall system speed-up (S) gained by optimizing a single part of a system by a factor (s) is limited by the proportion of execution time of that part (p). 𝑆 = 1 1 − 𝑝 + 𝑝 𝑠 Why Accelerated Computing? Accelerated computing is needed to tackle the most impactful opportunities of our time—like AI, climate simulation, drug discovery, ray tracing, and robotics. NVIDIA is uniquely dedicated to accelerated computing —working top-to-bottom—refactoring applications and creating new algorithms, and bottom-to-top—inventing new specialized processors, like RT Core and Tensor Core. “It’s the end of Moore’s Law as we know it.” - John Hennessy Oct 23, 2018 “Moore’s Law is dead.” - Jensen Huang, GTC 2013 Advancing computing in the post-Moore’s Law era 102 103 104 105 106 107 109 108 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 GPU-Computing perf 2X per year 1000X In 10 years Single-threaded CPU perf 1.5X perf per year 1.1X per year Trillions of Operations per Second (TOPS) AI Is the Greatest Technology Force of Our Time Data centers across industries will become AI factories Meeting TranscriptionContact Center AI 3B Meeting Minutes / Day500M Calls / Day Public Safety >1B Smart City Cameras Deployed Retail Asset Protection $94.5B Inventory Loss / Year Industrial InspectionMedical Imaging $32M Vision Sensors Installed by 2025 10M Diagnostic Scans / Day Transportation 10T Miles / Year Credit Card Fraud 1.28B Credit Transactions / Day Product Recommendations 1B E-Commerce Visitors / Day AI has fundamentally changed what software can make and how you make software. Companies are processing & refining their data, making AI software—becoming intelligence manufacturers. Their data centers are AI factories. The first wave of AI is learned perception and inference, like recognizing images, understanding speech, recommending a video, or an item to buy. The next wave of AI is robotics—AI planning actions. Digital robots, avatars, and physical robots will perceive, plan and act. NVIDIA’s acceleration stacks and ecosystems help bring AI to the world’s largest industries. NVIDIA’s world-class AI expertise and scale can help revolutionize businesses.

Our initial focus is on industrial metaverses, such as digital twins used to emulate the behavior of products or factories in the physical world. Omniverse uses a real-time, large-scale 3D database that connects to 3D worlds via the USD (Universal Scene Descriptor) framework. Just as the internet connects websites over HTML, Omniverse connects 3D worlds over USD. Omniverse is essential for the next wave of AI—robotics—where AI interacts with the physical world. Applications built to run on Omniverse are like portals into the Omniverse virtual world.
