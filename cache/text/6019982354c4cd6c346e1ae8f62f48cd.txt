Cayman Islands &nbsp; Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated statements of financial position of Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as at September 30, 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income or loss for the three and nine-month periods then ended, changes in equity and cash flows for the nine-month period then ended, and notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo; issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review. &nbsp; Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with Brazilian and International Standards on Review (NBC TR 2410 - Revis&atilde;o de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Intermedi&aacute;rias Executada pelo Auditor da Entidade and ISRE 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity , respectively). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023, are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo;. &nbsp; &nbsp; S&atilde;o Paulo, November 14, 2023. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, unless otherwise stated) &nbsp; 1.

The address of the Company's registered office is Willow House, 4 th floor, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman - Cayman Islands. Nu Holdings has no operating activities with clients. The Company&#8217;s shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;) under the symbol &#8220;NU&#8221;. The Company holds investments in several operating entities and, as of September 30, 2023, its significant operating subsidiaries were: &#9679; Nu Pagamentos S.A. - Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamento (&#8220;Nu Pagamentos&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Brazil. Nu Pagamentos is engaged in the issuance and administration of credit cards and payment transfers through a prepaid account, and participation in other companies as partner or shareholder. Nu Pagamentos has as its primary products: (i) a Mastercard international credit card (issued in Brazil which allows payments for purchases to be made in monthly installments), fully managed through a smartphone app, and (ii) &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot;, a 100% digital smartphone app, maintenance-free prepaid account, which also includes features of a traditional bank account, such as electronic and peer-to-peer transfers, bill payments, withdrawals through the 24 Hours ATM network, instant payments, prepaid credit for mobile top ups and prepaid cards similar in functionality to debit cards. &#9679; Nu Financeira S.A. &#8211; SCFI (&#8220;Nu Financeira&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary also domiciled in Brazil, with personal loans and retail deposits as its main products. Nu Financeira offers customers in Brazil the possibility to obtain loans that can be customized in relation to amounts, terms and conditions, number of installments, and transparent disclosure of any charges involved in the transaction, fully managed through the above-mentioned smartphone app. Loan issuance, repayment, and prepayments are available 24/7 through &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot;, directly in the app. Nu Financeira also grants credit to Nu Pagamentos credit card holders, due to overdue invoices, bill installments and revolving credit, and accepts on-demand and fixed term deposits from customers. &#9679; Nu Invest Corretora de Valores S.A. (&quot;Nu Invest&quot;) is an indirect subsidiary acquired in June 2021, domiciled in Brazil, and is a digital investment broker dealer. &#9679; Nu Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (&quot;Nu DTVM&quot;) is an indirect subsidiary that executes securities brokerage activities in Brazil. &#9679; Nu M&eacute;xico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P. (&quot;Nu Financiera&quot;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Mexico. Nu Financiera is engaged in the issuance and administration of credit cards, payment transfers through a prepaid account and offers customers in M&eacute;xico the possibility to obtain loans, in addition to offering &quot;Nu Cuenta&quot;, a 100% digital account. It commenced operations in the Mexican market in November 2022 and officially launched in December 2022. The credit card and &quot;Nu Cuenta&quot; &nbsp; 12 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; have similar characteristics to the Brazilian operation: (i) an international credit card, with no annual fee, under the Mastercard banner, 100% managed by a digital app on a smartphone and (ii) a maintenance-free prepaid account, which also includes features of a traditional bank account, such as electronic and peer-to-peer transfers, bill payments, withdrawals through the 24 Hours ATM. &#9679; Nu Colombia S.A. (&#8220;Nu Colombia&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Colombia, with operations related to credit cards, which was launched in September 2020. On August 10, 2022, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (&quot;SFC&quot;) approved the Group's request to incorporate a financing company in Colombia, Nu Colombia Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Financiamiento S.A (&quot;Nu Colombia Financiamiento&quot;) (&quot;Incorporation License&quot;). Nu Colombia Financiamiento requested the license to operate as a financial company, which is still pending approval. If the request is approved, it will enable Nu Colombia to offer deposit products in the future, amongst other financial products. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as the &#8220;Group&#8221; or &quot;Nu&#8221;. The business plan of Nu provides for the continued growth of its Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian operations, not only related to existing businesses, such as credit cards, personal loans, investments, and insurance, but also complemented by the launch of new products. Accordingly, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption of the Group continuing as a going concern. The business is affected by customer behavior throughout the year and demonstrates seasonality effects. Historically, the Group benefited from a higher volume of transactions and related revenue in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. However, the growth has masked this seasonality in the past, and this may become more pronounced in the future. The Company&#8217;s Board authorized the issuance of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements on November 14, 2023. a) Level III BDRs Program discontinuation On June 28, 2023 the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (&quot;CVM&quot;) Collegiate approved the plan for the discontinuance of the Company's Level III BDRs Program and the cancellation of the Company's registration with the CVM as a foreign public issuer of category &quot;A&quot; securities. The Definition Period for Level III BDRs holders to make their choices among the possible alternatives within the scope of the discontinuity plan was closed on August 11, 2023, and the sale of the Class A Common Shares underlying the BDRs that were held by the holders of the BDRs that, within the scope of the Level III BDRs Program Discontinuance plan, were directed to the Sale Procedures, ended on August 21, 2023. On September 22, 2023 the Company submitted a request to CVM to cancel the registration of the Level III BDRs Program and, consequently, to cancel Company's registry as a foreign issuer before CVM. On October 31, 2023 the cancellation was approved by CVM. b) Nucoin In February of 2023, Nu commenced the distribution of Nucoin, the native blockchain token issued by the Company, designed to support a loyalty network known as the &quot;Nucoin Network'' between Nu and its customers. The long-term objective for Nu is to onboard other sponsoring companies, referred to as &nbsp; 13 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Sponsors&quot;, who commit to adopting Nucoin as their loyalty program. These Sponsors will be entitled to a certain number of Nucoins to distribute to their own customer base and will be required to provide incentives and benefits to Nucoin holders, thereby fostering network adoption and enhancing the utility of Nucoin within the community. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had a provision of US$8,933 due its commitment to sponsor the liquidity poll pertaining to Nucoins. 2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&quot;IFRS&#8221;) as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;IASB&#8221;). However, selected condensed explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to understanding the changes in the Company&#8217;s financial position and performance since the issuance of its last annual financial statements. The Group&#8217;s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting issued by IASB. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the &quot;Annual Financial Statements&#8221;). a) Functional currency and foreign currency translation The presentation of the functional currency and foreign currency translation disclosed in note 2a of the Annual Financial Statements remain valid for these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The functional currency for Nu Holdings and the presentation currency of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar (&#8220;US$&#8221;). The functional currency of the Brazilian operating entities is the Brazilian real, for the Mexican entities, Mexican peso and for the Colombian entities, the Colombian peso. The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries held in functional currencies that are not US$ are translated into US$, and the exchange differences arising from the translation to US$ of the financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than the US$ are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or loss (OCI) as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss within &#8220;currency translation on foreign entities&#8221;. b) New or revised accounting pronouncements adopted in 2023 The following new or revised standards have been issued by IASB, were effective for the period covered by these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, and had no significant impact. &#9679; Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2); &#9679; Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8); and &#9679; Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12). &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Other new standards and interpretations not yet effective &#9679; Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1). Management does not expect the adoption of the amendments described above to have a significant impact, other than additional disclosures, on the consolidated financial statements. 3. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounting balances of Nu Holdings and all those subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, directly or indirectly. Control is achieved where the Company has (i) power over the investee; (ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) can use its power to affect its profits. The Company re-assesses whether it maintains control of an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three above mentioned elements of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over it and ceases when the Company loses control over it. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. The financial information of the subsidiaries was prepared in the same period as the Company and consistent accounting policies were applied. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Company. Accordingly, all balances, transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising between consolidated entities are eliminated in the consolidation, except for foreign-currency gain and losses on translation of intercompany loans. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income or loss are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, when applicable. The subsidiaries below are the most relevant entities included in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements: Entity &nbsp; Control &nbsp; Principal activities &nbsp; Functional currency &nbsp; Country &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 Nu Pagamentos S.A. - Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamentos (&#8220;Nu Pagamentos&#8221;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Credit card and prepaid account operations &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 100% &nbsp; 100% Nu Financeira S.A. &#8211; SCFI (&#8220;Nu Financeira&#8221;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Loan operations &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 100% &nbsp; 100% Nu Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios Ltda.

(&quot;Nu Financiera&quot;), a Mexican subsidiary, is regulated by both the Mexican Central Bank (&quot;BANXICO&quot;) and Mexican National Banking and Stock Commission (&#8220;CNBV&#8221;) and Nu Colombia, a Colombian subsidiary, is regulated by Industry and Commerce Superintendency, and as such, there are some regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from these entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements and therefore should be read in conjunction. 5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires judgments, estimates, and assumptions from management that affect the application of accounting policies, and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to the estimates are recognized prospectively. The significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 were the same as those adopted in the Annual Financial Statements. Credit losses on financial instruments The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on credit cards, loans receivables that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of allowance as of each reporting date. Management performs an analysis of the credit card and loan amounts to determine if credit losses have occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. Key areas of judgment The critical judgments made by management in applying the expected credit losses (&quot;ECL&quot;) allowance methodology are: &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Definition of default; b) Forward-looking information used for the projection of macroeconomic scenarios; c) Probability weights of future scenarios; d) Definition of significant increase in credit risk and lifetime; and e) Look-back period, used for parameters estimation (probability of default - PD, exposure at default - EAD and loss given default - LGD). Sensitivity analysis On September 30, 2023, the probability weighted ECL allowance for credit card and lending totaled US$2,252,390 of which US$1,851,062 related to credit card operations and US$401,328 to loans. The ECL allowance is sensitive to the methodology, assumptions and estimations underlying its calculation. One key assumption is the probability weighting of the macroeconomic scenarios between upside, base and downside as the carrying amount of the credit loss allowance is determined based on the weighted average of these scenarios. The table below illustrates the ECL that would have arisen if management had applied a 100% weighting to each macroeconomic scenario. &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighted average &nbsp; Upside &nbsp; Base case &nbsp; Downside &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card and lending ECL &nbsp; 2,252,390 &nbsp; 2,114,749 &nbsp; 2,236,227 &nbsp; 2,457,604 &nbsp; 6.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; cardholder&#8217;s credit limit is initially reduced by the total amount and the installments become due and payable on the cardholder's subsequent monthly credit card statement. Brazil makes the corresponding payments to the credit card network (see note 22) following a similar schedule. As receipts and payments are aligned, the Group does not incur significant financing costs with this product, however it is exposed to the credit risk of the cardholder as it is obliged to make the payments to the credit card network even if the cardholder does not pay. &#8220;Receivables - installments&#8221; also includes the amounts of credit card bills not fully paid by the customers and that have been converted into payments in installments with a fixed interest rate (&quot; fatura parcelada&quot; ), in addition to bill financing, which comprise bills paid in installments through the credit card, banking payment slips (&quot; boleto &quot;) and PIX financing in more than one installment.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, and is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored in order to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. &nbsp; 27 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; All receivables are classified through stages, where: (i) stage 1 include all receivables not classified in stages 2 and 3; (ii) stage 2 is primarily related to all receivables more than 30 (thirty), but less than 90 (ninety), days in arrears, or with an increase in client's behavior risk score compared to the time of the origination; and (iii) stage 3 when receivables are more than 90 (ninety) days in arrears, or there are indications that the financial asset will not be fully paid without a collateral or financial guarantee. The majority of the Group's credit card portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 3 exposures increased to 8.1% on September 30, 2023 from 6.5% on December 31, 2022. The stage 3 movement is primarily due to credit expansions done in the past which are maturing in the portfolio, as well as increases in early delinquency observed in the previous quarters. &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Exposures &nbsp; % &nbsp; Credit Loss Allowance &nbsp; % &nbsp; Coverage Ratio (%) Stage 1 &nbsp; 10,073,332 &nbsp; 81.8% &nbsp; 573,922 &nbsp; 31.0% &nbsp; 5.7% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 2 &nbsp; 1,245,821 &nbsp; 10.1% &nbsp; 400,741 &nbsp; 21.6% &nbsp; 32.2% Absolute Trigger (Days Late) &nbsp; 311,648 &nbsp; 25.0% &nbsp; 217,048 &nbsp; 54.2% &nbsp; 69.6% Relative Trigger (PD deterioration) &nbsp; 934,173 &nbsp; 75.0% &nbsp; 183,693 &nbsp; 45.8% &nbsp; 19.7% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 3 &nbsp; 997,002 &nbsp; 8.1% &nbsp; 876,399 &nbsp; 47.4% &nbsp; 87.9% Total &nbsp; 12,316,155 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 1,851,062 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 15.0% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Exposures &nbsp; % &nbsp; Credit Loss Allowance &nbsp; % &nbsp; Coverage Ratio (%) Stage 1 &nbsp; 7,750,270 &nbsp; 83.6% &nbsp; 322,970 &nbsp; 30.7% &nbsp; 4.2% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 2 &nbsp; 917,178 &nbsp; 9.9% &nbsp; 254,181 &nbsp; 24.2% &nbsp; 27.7% Absolute Trigger (Days Late) &nbsp; 215,209 &nbsp; 23.5% &nbsp; 140,167 &nbsp; 55.1% &nbsp; 65.1% Relative Trigger (PD deterioration) &nbsp; 701,969 &nbsp; 76.5% &nbsp; 114,014 &nbsp; 44.9% &nbsp; 16.2% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 3 &nbsp; 598,777 &nbsp; 6.5% &nbsp; 473,517 &nbsp; 45.1% &nbsp; 79.1% Total &nbsp; 9,266,225 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 1,050,668 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 11.3% &nbsp; 28 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The provision is estimated using modeling techniques, consistently applied, which is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables (the coverage ratio) is also monitored in order to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator and it is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the credit forums. All receivables are classified through stages. The explanation of each stage is set out in the Company&#8217;s accounting policies, as disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022. The majority of the Group's loans to customers&#8217; portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 1 exposures increased to 79.5% on September 30, 2023 compared to 77.0% on December 31, 2022. The stage 1 coverage ratio movement is primarily due to the growth of the portfolio due to origination into lower risk segments. &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Exposures &nbsp; % &nbsp; Credit Loss Allowance &nbsp; % &nbsp; Coverage Ratio Stage 1 &nbsp; 2,458,674 &nbsp; 79.5% &nbsp; 128,538 &nbsp; 32.0% &nbsp; 5.2% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 2 &nbsp; 474,877 &nbsp; 15.4% &nbsp; 163,534 &nbsp; 40.7% &nbsp; 34.4% Absolute Trigger (Days Late) &nbsp; 98,167 &nbsp; 20.7% &nbsp; 80,630 &nbsp; 49.3% &nbsp; 82.1% Relative Trigger (PD deterioration) &nbsp; 376,710 &nbsp; 79.3% &nbsp; 82,904 &nbsp; 50.7% &nbsp; 22.0% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 3 &nbsp; 157,185 &nbsp; 5.1% &nbsp; 109,256 &nbsp; 27.3% &nbsp; 69.5% Total &nbsp; 3,090,736 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 401,328 &nbsp; 100.0% &nbsp; 13.0% &nbsp; 32 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Hedge of foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on forecast transaction expenses, related to the cloud infrastructure, certain software licenses and intercompany expenses. The Group managed its exposures to the variability in cash flows of foreign currency forecasted transactions to movements in foreign exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange contracts (exchange futures). These instruments are entered into to match the cash flow profile of the estimated forecast transactions, and are exchange-traded and fair value movements are settled on a daily basis. The Group applies hedge accounting to the forecasted transactions related to its main cloud infrastructure contract and other expenses in foreign currency including intercompany expenses. The effectiveness is assessed monthly by analyzing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the amount of the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. Derivatives are generally rolled over monthly. They are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedging instrument. Therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transaction have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective.

To hedge this risk, the Group entered into DI futures contracts, and applied hedge accounting aiming to eliminate differences between the accounting measurement of its derivatives and hedged items. The Group&#8217;s overall hedging strategy is to reduce fair value changes of the part of the fixed rate portfolio as if they were floating rate instruments linked to the attributable benchmark rates. As such, in order to reflect the dynamic nature of the hedged portfolio, the strategy is to rebalance the DI future contracts and evaluate the allocated amount by the credit portfolio. Additionally, ineffectiveness could arise from the disparity between expected and actual prepayments (prepayment risk). In accordance with its hedging strategy, the Group calculates the DV01 (delta value of a basis point ) of the exposure and futures to identify the optimal hedging ratio, and monitors in a timely manner the hedge relationship, providing any rebalancing if needed. The need for the purchase or sale of new DI future contracts will be assessed, to counterbalance the hedged item&#8217;s fair value adjustment, aiming to assure hedge effectiveness between 80% and 125%, as determined on hedge documentation. The effectiveness test for the hedge is done on a prospective and retrospective basis. In the prospective test, the Group compares the impact of a 1 basis point parallel shift on the interest rate curve (DV01) on the hedged object and on the hedge instrument fair value. For the retrospective test, the fair value change since the inception of the hedged object is compared to the hedge instrument. In both cases, the hedge is considered effective if the correlation is between 80% and 125%. As of September 30, 2023 the effectiveness ratio for the hedges of the credit card and loan portfolios were 100% and 99%, respectively. For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in &quot;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments - financial assets at fair value&quot;. In addition, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Hedge of corporate and social security taxes over share-based compensation The Group's hedge strategy is to cover the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting and SOP exercise from the variation of the Company's share price volatility. The derivative financial instruments used to cover the exposure are total return swaps (&quot;TRS&quot;) in which one leg is indexed to the Company's stock price and the other leg is indexed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&quot;SOFR&quot;) plus spread. The stock fixed at the TRS is a weighted average price. The hedge was entered into by Nu Holdings and therefore there is no income tax effect. The Group applies the cash flow hedge for the hedge structure thus the market risk is replaced by an interest rate risk. The effectiveness assessment is performed monthly by (i) assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) monitoring the credit risk impact in the hedge effectiveness; and (iii) maintaining and updating the hedging ratio. Given the possibility of forfeiture impacting the future cash forecast of the employee benefit plan, the Group manages exposures to keep the hedging level within an acceptable coverage. The derivative fair value is measured substantially based on the stock price which is also used in the measurement of the provision or payment for corporate and social security taxes. There is no expectation for a mismatch between the hedged item and hedging instrument at maturity other than the SOFR. &nbsp; &nbsp; Nine-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 09/30/2022 Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; (4,876) &nbsp; - Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; 46,128 &nbsp; (1,329) Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period (note 10) &nbsp; (24,205) &nbsp; 1,203 to &quot;Customer support and operation&quot; &nbsp; (858) &nbsp; - to &quot;General and administrative expenses&quot; &nbsp; (22,736) &nbsp; 1,203 to &quot;Marketing expenses&quot; &nbsp; (611) &nbsp; - Balance at end of the period &nbsp; 17,047 &nbsp; (126) &nbsp; Expected cash disbursement &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to 1 year &nbsp; 1 to 3 years &nbsp; Above 3 years &nbsp; Total &nbsp; Total Considering the reporting date fair value of the hedged item: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expected cash disbursement for corporate and social contributions &nbsp; 40,903 &nbsp; 52,698 &nbsp; 12,091 &nbsp; 105,692 &nbsp; 59,058 Total &nbsp; 40,903 &nbsp; 52,698 &nbsp; 12,091 &nbsp; 105,692 &nbsp; 59,058 &nbsp; 43 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

In Mexico, it includes &quot;CuentaNu&quot;, as it is locally denominated. &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot; is a prepaid account in which the amounts deposited by customers are classified as electronic money and must be allocated to government securities (see note 12b) or in a specific account maintained at the Central Bank of Brazil (see note 15), in accordance with Brazilian regulatory requirements. &quot;Conta NuInvest&quot; balances also have to be allocated to government securities or maintained in free reserves at the Central Bank of Brazil. Therefore, these types of deposits cannot be used for any other type of investment or as a financing source for credit operations. Conversely, &quot;CuentaNu&quot; balances are not required to be invested in specific assets. Therefore, they can be used as a financing source for the credit card operations in Mexico. &nbsp; 44 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unlike the deposits in electronic money, Nu is required to follow the compulsory deposits requirements for RDB deposits (see note 15), however it is not required to invest the remaining resources in government securities or in specific account maintained at the Central Bank of Brazil - these amounts can be used as a financing source for lending and credit card operations. There are also RDBs with a defined future maturity date, which had a maturity of up to 27 months and a weighted average interest rate of 106.5% as of September 30, 2023 (104% on December 31, 2022) of the Brazilian CDI rate. The return from both &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot; and RDB deposits is 100% of the Brazilian CDI rate as of the initial date, if the balances are kept for more than 30 days. Nu also offers &quot;Caixinhas&quot; which correspond to money boxes in which RDBs generate daily yield as of the deposit date.

Such matters are being discussed at the administrative and judicial levels, which, when applicable, are supported by judicial deposits. The provisions for probable losses arising from these matters are estimated and periodically adjusted by management, supported by external legal advisors&#8217; opinion. There is significant uncertainty relating to the timing of any cash outflow, if any, for civil and labor risk. a) Provision A provision in the amount of US$15,747 on December 31, 2022 referred to a potential legal obligation related to the increase in the contribution of certain Brazilian taxes (PIS and COFINS). The Group had a judicial deposit related to this claim, and in June 2019, Nu withdrew the lawsuit. The release of the judicial deposits in favor of the Brazilian Tax Authorities occurred in May 2023, representing final settlement of the matter with the consequent use of the provisioned amount. &nbsp; 48 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Civil lawsuits are mainly related to credit card operations. Based on management&#8217;s assessment and inputs from Nu&#8217;s external legal advisors, the Group has provisioned US$5,153 (US$2,096 on December 31, 2022) considered sufficient to cover estimated losses from civil suits deemed probable. b) Changes Changes to provision for lawsuits and administrative proceedings are as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 09/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Tax &nbsp; Civil &nbsp; Labor &nbsp; Tax &nbsp; Civil &nbsp; Labor &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; 15,747 &nbsp; 2,096 &nbsp; 104 &nbsp; 17,081 &nbsp; 980 &nbsp; 21 Additions &nbsp; - &nbsp; 9,209 &nbsp; 278 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,656 &nbsp; 64 Payments/Reversals &nbsp; (16,606) &nbsp; (6,239) &nbsp; (184) &nbsp; (2,355) &nbsp; (735) &nbsp; (12) Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; 859 &nbsp; 87 &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 628 &nbsp; (19) &nbsp; (2) Balance at end of the period &nbsp; - &nbsp; 5,153 &nbsp; 202 &nbsp; 15,354 &nbsp; 1,882 &nbsp; 71 c) Contingencies The Group is a party to civil and labor lawsuits, involving risks classified by management and the legal advisors as possible losses, totaling approximately US$12,425 and US$9,422, respectively (US$7,128 and US$1,814 on December 31, 2022). Based on management&#8217;s assessment and inputs from the Group&#8217;s external legal advisors, no provision was recognized for those lawsuits as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of judicial deposits shown as &#8220;Other assets&#8221; (note 17) is US$3,195 (US$18,864 on December 31, 2022) and is substantially attributed to the judicial deposit carried on behalf of the shareholders of Nu Invest, prior to the acquisition, due to a tax proceeding related to withholding taxes inappropriately deducted from amounts paid to employees. 25.

The points do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of Rewards an eligible card member can earn. Deferred annual fees from the reward program comprise amounts related to the rewards fees which are paid annually by customers until they are earned. The redemption of the points occurs when the customers use them in various purchase categories, such as air tickets, hotels, transportation services, and music. Nu uses financial models to estimate the redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members, and, therefore, the estimated financial value of the points, based on historical redemption trends, &nbsp; 49 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

RELATED PARTIES In the ordinary course of business, the Group may have issued credit cards or loans to Nu&#8217;s executive directors, board members, key employees and close family members. Those transactions, as well as the deposits and other products, such as investments, occur on similar terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. As described in note 3, &quot;Basis of consolidation&quot;, all companies from the Group are consolidated in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, related party balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. In 2023, the exchange differences arising from intercompany loans between entities of the group with different functional currencies are shown as &#8220;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments&#8221; in the statement of profit (loss). a) Transactions with other related parties &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets (Liabilities) Others &nbsp; - &nbsp; 316 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenues (expenses) Others &nbsp; - &nbsp; (1,112) &nbsp; &nbsp; As of September 30, 2023 the Company did not have any transactions with other related parties.

In addition, the Group did not make payments for Reprograma, a philanthropic project managed by a family member of the Company&#8217;s controlling shareholder, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 28. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The main valuation techniques employed in internal models to measure the fair value of the financial instruments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are set out below. The principal inputs into these models are derived from observable market data. The Group did not make any material changes to its valuation techniques and internal models in those periods. a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost The following tables show the fair value of the financial instruments carried at amortized cost as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The Group has not disclosed the fair values of financial instruments such as compulsory and other deposits at central banks, other financial assets, deposits in electronic money and RDB, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value. &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Carrying amount &nbsp; Fair value - Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value - Level 3 &nbsp; Carrying amount &nbsp; Fair value - Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value - Level 3 Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 49,673 &nbsp; 49,661 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; - Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &nbsp; 5,849,454 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,778,019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card receivables (i) &nbsp; 10,495,501 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 10,948,908 &nbsp; 8,233,123 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 8,204,077 Loans to customers (i) &nbsp; 2,689,408 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 2,685,001 &nbsp; 1,676,276 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,920,518 Other receivables &nbsp; 1,600,735 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,603,153 &nbsp; 521,670 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 522,359 Other financial assets &nbsp; 172,026 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 478,283 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp; 20,856,797 &nbsp; 49,661 &nbsp; 15,237,062 &nbsp; 13,687,371 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 10,646,954 Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deposits in electronic money &nbsp; 1,350,035 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,534,582 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bank receipt of deposits (RDB) &nbsp; 17,602,515 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,273,959 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bank certificate of deposit (CDB) &nbsp; 164,666 &nbsp; 164,666 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Payables to network &nbsp; 7,834,854 &nbsp; 7,406,251 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 7,054,783 &nbsp; 6,399,704 &nbsp; - Borrowings and financing &nbsp; 1,085,870 &nbsp; 1,086,557 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 585,568 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp; 28,037,940 &nbsp; 8,657,474 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 23,448,892 &nbsp; 6,399,704 &nbsp; - &nbsp; (i) It excludes the fair value adjustment from the hedge accounting. The book value from credit card receivables and loans to customers includes the amounts that are the hedge items of the portfolio hedge, described in note 19. The credit risk components for both receivables are not part of the hedge strategy. Borrowings and financing includes the fair value calculated by the discounted cash flow method, and also cases in which the fair value is the same amount as the book value (cases with prepayment clauses at the amortized cost). The fair value of floating rate demand deposits are assumed to be equal to carrying amounts. &nbsp; 51 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; The valuation approach to specific categories of financial instruments is described below. i) Fair value models and inputs Credit card: The fair values of credit card receivables and payables to network are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Fair values are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. For payables, cash flows are also discounted by the Group's own credit spread. Loans to customers: Fair value is estimated based on groups of clients with similar risk profiles, using valuation models. The fair value of a loan is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. Other receivables: Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows by a risk free interest rate and a credit spread. b) Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value The following table shows a summary of the fair values, as of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of the financial assets and liabilities indicated below, classified on the basis of the various measurement methods used by the Group to determine their fair value: &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair value - Level 1 &nbsp; Fair value - Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value - Level 3 &nbsp; Total Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Government bonds &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 7,026,157 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 7,026,157 United States &nbsp; 133,790 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 133,790 Mexico &nbsp; 1,356 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,356 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corporate bonds and other instruments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certificate of bank deposits (CDB) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,319 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,319 Investment funds &nbsp; - &nbsp; 72,824 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 72,824 Time deposit &nbsp; - &nbsp; 302,160 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 302,160 Bill of credit (LC) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6 Real estate and agribusiness certificate of receivables &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; 18,946 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 18,963 Real estate and agribusiness letter of credit &nbsp; - &nbsp; 138 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 138 Corporate bonds and debentures &nbsp; 955,524 &nbsp; 174,841 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,130,365 Equity instrument &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 22,010 &nbsp; 22,010 Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 228 &nbsp; 9,125 &nbsp; 6,188 &nbsp; 15,541 Collateral for credit card operations &nbsp; - &nbsp; 316 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 316 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 2,713 &nbsp; 50,062 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 52,775 Instruments eligible as capital &nbsp; - &nbsp; 3,716 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 3,716 Repurchase agreements &nbsp; - &nbsp; 158,267 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 158,267 &nbsp; 52 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Therefore, all the government bonds and some corporate bonds are included in level 1 as they are traded in active markets. Brazilian securities values are the published prices by the &quot; Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais &quot; (&quot;Anbima&quot;). For US and Mexico bonds, fair values are the published prices by Bloomberg. Other corporate bonds and investment fund shares, the valuation of which is based on observable data, such as interest rates and interest rate curves are classified as level 2. Derivatives: Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified as level 1 of the hierarchy. Derivatives traded on the Brazilian stock exchange are fairly valued using B3 quotations. Interest rate OTC Swaps are valued by discounting future expected cash flows to present values using interest rate curves and are classified as level 2. The embedded derivative conversion feature from the senior preferred share was calculated based on methodologies for the share price described in note 10. Equity instrument: For the fair value of the equity instrument, the Group used contractual conditions as inputs that are not directly observable, and therefore it is classified as level 3. &nbsp; 53 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instruments eligible as capital: If the instrument has an active market, prices quoted in this market are used. Otherwise, valuation techniques are used, such as discounted cash flows, where cash flows are discounted by a risk-free rate and a credit spread. Instruments eligible as capital were designated at fair value through profit (loss) in the initial recognition (fair value option). Repurchase agreements: The fair value is the transaction value itself given that repurchase agreement is a collateralized short-term one day agreement. c) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels 1 and 2 or between levels 2 and 3. &nbsp; 29. INCOME TAX Current and deferred taxes are determined for all transactions that have been recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the current tax laws. The current income tax expense or benefit represents the estimated taxes to be paid or refunded, respectively, for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary tax differences are expected to reverse. a) Income tax reconciliation The tax on the Group's pre-tax profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities. Thus, the following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to profit (loss) for the period, calculated by applying the combined Brazilian income tax rate of 40% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 41% from August 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. &nbsp; 54 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The tax rate used is not materially different from the average effective tax rate considering all jurisdictions where the Group has operations. The effect of other tax rates is shown in the table above as &#8220;effect of different tax rates &#8211; subsidiaries and parent company&#8221;. (ii) Mostly related to the amount of deductions and incentives. b) Deferred income taxes The following tables present significant components of the Group&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the changes for the both periods.

MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND OTHER RISKS a) Overview The Group monitors the risks that could have a material impact on its strategic objectives, including those that must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To efficiently manage and mitigate these risks, the risk management structure conducts risk identification and assessment to prioritize the risks that are key to pursue potential opportunities and/or that may prevent value from being created or that may compromise existing value, with the possibility of having impacts on financial results, capital, liquidity, customer relationship and reputation. &nbsp; 59 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Risks that are actively monitored include Credit, Liquidity, Market, Operational, IT, Cyber, Regulatory, Compliance, AML (Anti-money laundering), Reputational Risk, Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRBB), Model Risk, and also the risk from Cryptocurrency business. Nu considers Risk Management an important pillar of the Group's strategic management. The risk management structure broadly permeates the entire Company, with the objective of ensuring that risks are properly identified, measured, mitigated, monitored and reported, in order to support the development of its activities. Risk Management is related to the principles, culture, structures and processes to improve the decision-making process and the achievement of strategic objectives. It is a continuous and evolving process that runs through Nu's entire strategy, to support Management in minimizing its losses, as well as maximizing its profits and supporting the Company's values. The Group's risk management structure considers the size and complexity of its business, which allows tracking, monitoring and control of the risks to which it is exposed. The risk management process is aligned with management guidelines, which, through committees and other internal meetings, define strategic objectives, including risk appetite. Conversely, the capital control and capital management units provide support through risk and capital monitoring and analysis processes. Each of the risks described below has its own methodologies, systems and processes for its identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation. In the case of financial risks, such as credit, liquidity, IRRBB and market risk, the measurement is carried out based on quantitative models and, in certain cases, prospective scenarios in relation to the main variables involved, respecting the applicable regulatory requirements and best market practices. Non-financial risks, such as operational risk and technological/cyber risks, are measured using impact criteria (inherent risk), considering potential financial losses, reputational damage, customer perception and legal/regulatory obligations, as well as evaluated in relation to the effectiveness of the respective structure of internal controls. There were no significant changes to the risk management structure that was reported in the most recent annual financial statements as of December 31, 2022. &nbsp; 60 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

At the Nu Holdings level, there is no net investment hedge for investments in other countries.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The purpose of capital management is to maintain the capital adequacy for Nu's operation through control and monitoring of the capital position, to evaluate the capital necessity according to the risk taken and strategic aim of the organization, and to establish a capital planning process following future requirements of regulatory capital, based on the Group's growth projections, risk exposure, market movements, and other relevant information. Also, the capital management structure is responsible for identifying sources of capital, writing and submitting the capital plan and capital contingent plan for approval by the Executive Directors. In July 2023, a new regulatory framework from the Central Bank of Brazil was implemented, setting the classification of conglomerates that includes at least one payment servicer institution, and Nu, being led by Nu Pagamentos in Brazil, is now classified as a Type 3 Prudential Conglomerate. This new regulation replaced the previous capital requirements for the financial conglomerate led by Nu Financeira. Therefore, the capital requirements for these two conglomerates are not comparable due to differences in scope. The amounts for September 2023 reflecting the Prudential Conglomerate requirements, are presented below in item (a). a) Regulatory capital composition i) Prudential conglomerate in Brazil The regulatory capital of the Prudential Conglomerate, defined by the Central Bank of Brazil, consists of three key components: &nbsp; 63 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The sum of CET1 and AT1 forms the overall Tier 1 Capital. &#9679; Tier II Capital: This involves subordinated debt instruments with set maturity dates that meet eligibility requirements. The phase-in, which covers the minimum capital requirements and prudential adjustments, as per current regulation are illustrated in the following table: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From July &nbsp; Full year Transitional Rule &nbsp; 2023 &nbsp; 2024 &nbsp; 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prudential adjustments Haircut &nbsp; 30.0% &nbsp; 60.0% &nbsp; 100.0% CET1 buffer (Conservation) &nbsp; 0.0% &nbsp; 1.25% &nbsp; 2.5% Minimum CET1 ratio (Including Buffers) &nbsp; 4.5% &nbsp; 5.75% &nbsp; 7.0% Minimum Tier 1 ratio &nbsp; 5.5% &nbsp; 7.25% &nbsp; 8.5% Minimum capital adequacy ratio &nbsp; 6.75% &nbsp; 8.75% &nbsp; 10.50% &nbsp; The following table demonstrates the calculated capital ratios for the CET1, Tier 1, and the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).

OTHER TRANSACTIONS a) Accounting for crypto-assets - Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&quot;SAB 121&quot;) In March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which addresses the rights and obligations of the parties to a crypto asset safeguarding arrangement. SAB 121 explains that an issuer that has obligations to safeguard digital assets held for their platform users should recognize those digital assets as an asset and a liability to return them to the customers, both of which are measured at fair value. In June 2022, the Group launched a platform, through its subsidiary Nu Crypto Ltda. (&quot;Nu Crypto&quot;), which allows clients to trade crypto assets, in partnership with specialized brokers. The custody activity is performed by the brokers, which holds the cryptographic key information, and the Company's contractual arrangements state that its customers retain legal ownership of the crypto; have the right to sell or transfer the crypto assets; and also benefit from the rewards and bear the risks associated with the ownership, including as a result of any crypto price fluctuations. The Company maintains an internal recordkeeping of the crypto assets held for the customers. The Group concluded that its activities may create crypto-asset safeguarding obligations (as defined in SAB 121) to its customers as a result of certain technological, legal and regulatory risks and, therefore, it should record a safeguarding liability and a corresponding asset at the fair value of the crypto assets held by customers on the Group&#8217;s platform. The following table summarizes the balances relating to crypto assets held for customers. For the purpose of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements the asset and liability have not been recognized. &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 12/31/2022 Fair value of the crypto assets held for customers &nbsp; 32,029 &nbsp; 18,313 Fair value of Nucoin assets held for customers (note 1b) &nbsp; 49,642 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 66 &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.
