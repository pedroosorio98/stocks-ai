Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview For the third quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $12.9 billion, down 2%, earnings per share of $4.37, ROE of 16% and ROTCE of 19%. • Total net revenue was $42.7 billion, up 7%, reflecting: – Net interest income ("NII") of $23.4 billion, up 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, higher revolving balances in Card Services, higher Markets net interest income, and higher wholesale deposit balances, largely offset by lower average deposit balances in CCB and deposit margin compression across the lines of business. NII excluding Markets was $23.4 billion, up 1%. – Noninterest revenue ("NIR") was $19.2 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, and higher investment banking fees. • Noninterest expense was $22.6 billion, up 4%, driven by higher compensation expense, including higher revenue- related compensation and growth in the number of employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. • The provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion, reflecting $2.1 billion of net charge-offs and a net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $1.0 billion. Net charge-offs increased by $590 million, predominantly driven by the seasoning of newer vintages and continued credit normalization in Card Services. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $882 million in consumer, driven by Card Services, and $144 million in wholesale. 5 The provision in the prior year was $1.4 billion, reflecting $1.5 billion of net charge-offs and a $113 million net reduction in the allowance for credit losses. • The total allowance for credit losses was $26.5 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.86%, compared with 1.73% in the prior year. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.6 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, up 6%, driven by higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected downgrades in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, partially offset by net sales of consumer nonaccrual loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 64-72 and pages 60-63, respectively, for additional information. • Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 1%, driven by higher loans across the lines of business. • Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 1%, reflecting: – net inflows in Payments and Securities Services, – the impact of new and existing product offerings in AWM, and – higher balances in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives, largely offset by – a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due to increased customer spending. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for additional information. Selected capital and other metrics • CET1 capital was $273 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.3% and 15.5%, respectively. • SLR was 6.0%. • TBVPS grew 18%, ending the third quarter of 2024 at $96.42. • As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm had eligible end-of- period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $868 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $608 billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9–14 and pages 15–16, respectively, for a further discussion of the Firm's results, including the provision for credit losses.

Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 88 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-33 of the 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2024 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2024 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. Full-year 2024 • Management expects net interest income to be approximately $92.5 billion and net interest income excluding Markets to be approximately $91.5 billion, market dependent. • Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $91.5 billion, market dependent. • Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be approximately 3.40%. Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19. Business Developments First Republic acquisition On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the "First Republic acquisition") from the FDIC, as receiver. The Firm continues to progress in the conversion of operations, and the integration of clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. The Firm expects that these actions will be substantially complete by the end of 2024. Refer to Note 26 for additional information on First Republic. 8 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unless otherwise specified. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment's results. Refer to pages 84-86 of this Form 10-Q and pages 155–158 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations. Visa shares: On April 8, 2024, Visa Inc. commenced an initial exchange offer for its Class B-1 common shares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million Visa Class B-1 common shares in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in a $7.9 billion net gain on the share exchange recorded in the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had disposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales and through a donation to the Firm’s Foundation. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 77-82, and Notes 2 and 5 for additional information. First Republic: JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC on May 1, 2023. As a result, the year-to-date results include the nine-month impact of First Republic compared with five months in the prior-year period. Where meaningful to the results, this is referred to in this Form 10-Q as the "timing impact" of First Republic. Refer to Notes 5 and 26 for additional information.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information. (b) Effective January 1, 2024, as a result of adopting updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance, the amortization of certain of the Firm’s alternative energy tax-oriented investments that was previously recognized in other income is now being recognized in income tax expense. Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information. (c) Included the net gain related to Visa shares of $7.9 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information. (d) Included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 5 and 26 for additional information. Quarterly results Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by higher industry-wide issuances in high-grade and high- yield bonds, as well as wallet share gains in investment- grade loans, • higher advisory fees predominantly driven by the closing of several large transactions, and • higher equity underwriting fees driven by increased industry-wide fees in follow-on offerings and wallet share gains in convertible securities offerings. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 27-34 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue decreased driven by: • lower Fixed Income Markets revenue across most businesses, and • a loss of $109 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB, compared with a loss of $61 million in the prior year, predominantly offset by • higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives. The decrease in principal transactions revenue also included lower revenue in Treasury and CIO. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. 9 The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 27-34 and pages 40-42, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased driven by: • a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic in AWM, and to a lesser extent in CIB, partially offset by • higher other lending- and deposit-related fees in CIB. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 27-34 and pages 35-39, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees increased driven by higher average market levels in AWM and CCB, and net inflows in AWM. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 22-26 and pages 35-39, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees increased, predominantly due to higher brokerage commissions and fees, higher custody fees primarily in CIB, as well as higher annuity sales commissions in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 22-26, pages 27-34 and pages 35-39, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Investment securities losses decreased, reflecting lower net losses associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 40-42 and Note 9 for additional information. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 14 for information on mortgage fees and related income. Card income increased in CCB, reflecting higher annual fees, and higher net interchange on increased debit and credit card sales volume, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Other income increased, reflecting: • an increase associated with other equity investments in Corporate, primarily driven by a net gain compared to a net loss in the prior year related to Visa shares, and • the impact of the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on January 1, 2024, resulting in the amortization of certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments previously recognized in other income now being recognized in income tax expense, partially offset by • the absence of the prior-year adjustment to the estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition in Corporate. Both periods included impairment losses related to certain equity investments in CIB. Refer to Notes 1, 5 and 13 for additional information on the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance; Notes 2 and 5 for additional information on Visa shares and Notes 5 and 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Net interest income increased, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio; higher revolving balances in Card Services; higher Markets net interest income; and higher wholesale deposit balances. These factors were largely offset by lower average deposit balances in CCB and deposit margin compression across the lines of business. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.6 trillion, up $290 billion, and the yield was 5.55%, up 23 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.58%, a decrease of 14 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.86%, down 3 bps. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 190 for further information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a further discussion of net yield excluding Markets. Year-to-date results Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by higher industry-wide issuances in leveraged loans, high- grade and high-yield bonds, • higher equity underwriting fees driven by higher IPOs, follow-on, and convertible securities offerings, and • higher advisory fees predominantly driven by increased M&A activity. Principal transactions revenue decreased driven by: • lower Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting the net impact of declines across macro businesses and higher revenue in Securitized Products, predominantly offset by • higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives. The decrease in principal transactions revenue also included lower revenue in Treasury and CIO. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting in CIB, higher lending-related fees, including loan commitment fees, and higher deposit-related fees, including cash management fees in Payments, on higher volume. These factors were largely offset by a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount, primarily in AWM, as certain of the acquired First Republic lending- related commitments have expired. Asset management fees increased driven by higher average market levels and net inflows in AWM and CCB, as well as the timing impact of First Republic in CCB. 10 Commissions and other fees increased, predominantly due to higher brokerage commissions and fees, and custody fees, in both CIB and AWM, as well as higher annuity sales commissions in CCB. Investment securities losses decreased, reflecting lower losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Mortgage fees and related income increased in Home Lending, reflecting higher production revenue, which included the timing impact of First Republic. Card income increased in CCB, reflecting higher net interchange on increased debit and credit card sales volume, as well as higher annual fees, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs. Other income increased, reflecting: • in Corporate – the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by – the absence of the prior-year $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition, and • the impact of the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on January 1, 2024, resulting in the amortization of certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments previously recognized in other income now being recognized in income tax expense. Both periods included impairment losses related to certain equity investments in CIB. The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in China International Fund Management ("CIFM") in AWM. Refer to AWM segment results on pages 35-39 for additional information on CIFM. Net interest income increased, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix, reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, and higher rates; higher revolving balances in Card Services; the timing impact of First Republic; higher Markets net interest income; and higher wholesale deposit balances. These factors were largely offset by deposit margin compression across the lines of business and lower average deposit balances in CCB. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5 trillion, up $228 billion, and the yield was 5.56%, up 55 bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.64%, a decrease of 2 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.85%, relatively flat when compared to the prior year. 11 Provision for credit losses Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Consumer, excluding credit card $ 145 $ (75) NM $ 366 $ 728 (50) % Credit card 2,666 1,527 75 % 6,932 4,073 70 Total consumer 2,811 1,452 94 7,298 4,801 52 Wholesale 302 (81) NM 702 1,730 (59) Investment securities (2) 13 NM 47 27 74 Total provision for credit losses $ 3,111 $ 1,384 125 % $ 8,047 $ 6,558 23 % Quarterly results The provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion, reflecting $2.1 billion of net charge-offs and a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs included $1.9 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of newer vintages and continued credit normalization, and $158 million in wholesale. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses consisted of: • $882 million in consumer, driven by Card Services, due to growth in revolving balances and changes in certain macroeconomic variables, and • $144 million in wholesale, reflecting the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios, and net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, partially offset by changes in certain macroeconomic variables. The provision in the prior year was $1.4 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.5 billion and a $113 million net reduction in the allowance for credit losses. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22-26, CIB on pages 27-34, AWM on pages 35-39, and Corporate on pages 40-42; Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75; Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 84-86; and Notes 11 and 12 for additional information on the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

The provision in the prior year was $6.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $4.0 billion and a $2.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, which included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 12 Noninterest expense (in millions) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Compensation expense $ 12,817 $ 11,726 9 % $ 38,888 $ 34,618 12 % Noncompensation expense: Occupancy 1,258 1,197 5 3,717 3,382 10 Technology, communications and equipment(a) 2,447 2,386 3 7,315 6,837 7 Professional and outside services 2,780 2,620 6 8,050 7,629 6 Marketing 1,258 1,126 12 3,639 3,293 11 Other expense 2,005 2,702 (26) 7,426 (d) 6,927 7 Total noncompensation expense 9,748 10,031 (3) 30,147 28,068 7 Total noninterest expense $ 22,565 $ 21,757 4 % $ 69,035 $ 62,686 10 % Certain components of other expense(b) Legal expense $ 259 $ 665 $ 504 $ 1,261 FDIC-related expense 312 342 1,576 997 Operating losses(c) 397 310 1,019 913 (a) Includes depreciation expense associated with auto operating lease assets.

(d) Included a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 5 for additional information. Quarterly results Compensation expense increased driven by: • higher revenue-related compensation particularly in CIB and AWM, and • growth in the number of employees, primarily in front office and technology. Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of: • lower legal expense, reflecting a decline in CIB, partially offset by an increase in AWM, • lower indirect tax expense in CIB, and • lower restructuring costs associated with First Republic, partially offset by • higher investments in the business, including marketing in CCB as well as in technology, and • higher operating losses, predominantly in CCB. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on other expense and Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Year-to-date results Compensation expense increased driven by: • higher volume- and revenue-related compensation across the LOBs, • growth in the number of employees, primarily in front office and technology, and • the impact of First Republic, predominantly in CCB and Corporate, reflecting timing and the classification of the prior-year expense, which was recognized in other expense in Corporate as the individuals associated with First Republic were not employees of the Firm until July 2023. Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: • the $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024 in Corporate, • the $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024 in Corporate, • higher investments in technology, as well as marketing, predominantly in CCB, • higher occupancy expense, which included the impact of net additions to the Firm's properties, • the timing impact associated with First Republic, partially offset by the alignment of expense to compensation expense, as noted above, and • higher distribution fees in AWM, partially offset by • lower legal expense, primarily reflecting the net impact of declines in CIB and Corporate, and an increase in AWM. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information on Visa shares. 13 Income tax expense (in millions) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Income before income tax expense $ 16,978 $ 16,733 1 % $ 57,706 $ 50,286 15 % Income tax expense 4,080 (a) 3,582 14 13,240 (a) 10,041 32 Effective tax rate 24.0 % 21.4 % 22.9 % 20.0 % (a) Effective January 1, 2024, as a result of adopting updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance, the amortization of certain of the Firm’s alternative energy tax-oriented investments is now being recognized in income tax expense.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making activities and higher demand for securities to cover short positions, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end. Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, reflecting higher demand for securities to cover short positions, and higher client-driven activities. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Trading assets increased due to higher levels of equity and debt instruments in Markets related to client-driven market-making activities, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end; and to a lesser extent, an increase in short-term cash deployment in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information. Investment securities increased due to: • higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities, reflecting net purchases, primarily U.S. Treasuries and non-U.S. government debt securities, partially offset by maturities and paydowns, and • lower HTM securities primarily driven by maturities and paydowns. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 40-42, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 76, and Notes 2 and 9 for additional information. Loans increased, reflecting: • higher wholesale loans in CIB, • higher securities-based lending in AWM, and • higher loans in Card Services driven by growth in new accounts and continued normalization of revolving balances, partially offset by • a decline in Home Lending as paydowns and loan sales outpaced originations. The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $1.5 billion in consumer, primarily in Card Services, due to loan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of newer vintages, and changes in certain macroeconomic variables, partially offset by a net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024. The wholesale allowance was flat as the net addition, including net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the impact of incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates in the second quarter of 2024, was offset by a net reduction, primarily due to the impact of changes in the loan portfolio and changes in certain macroeconomic variables. There was also a $168 million net addition to the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 9–14 and pages 58-76, respectively, Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 84-86, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for 15 additional information on loans and the total allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased primarily driven by higher client activities in Markets. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets. Other assets increased and included higher cash collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCP") in Markets, and the impact of the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on January 1, 2024.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making activities and higher secured financing of trading assets, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year- end. Short-term borrowings increased primarily driven by higher net issuance of structured notes due to client demand in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; and Notes 2 and 15 for deposits; and Note 10 for federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market- making activities primarily in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt instruments, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information. Accounts payable and other liabilities increased predominantly due to higher client activities in Markets, and the impact of the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on January 1, 2024. Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased driven by the issuance of credit card securitizations in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional information, specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts. Long-term debt increased, primarily driven by: • net issuances of structured notes in CIB due to client demand, and • net issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by lower FHLB advances in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57; and Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income and lower unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly driven by the impact of lower interest rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO, largely offset by the impact of capital actions, including repurchases of common shares, common and preferred stock dividend payments and net redemption of preferred stock. Refer to Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 92, Capital Actions on page 48, and Note 19 for additional information. 16 Consolidated cash flows analysis The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023. (in millions) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by/(used in) Operating activities $ (189,770) $ (47,257) Investing activities (181,023) (12,239) Financing activities 179,152 10,326 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1,750 (6,695) Net decrease in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks $ (189,891) $ (55,865) Operating activities • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading assets, higher securities borrowed, higher accrued interest and accounts receivable, and net originations and purchases of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and higher accounts payable and other liabilities. • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and lower accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by lower other assets and higher trading liabilities. Investing activities • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, net purchases of investment securities and net originations of loans. • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, higher net loan originations, and net cash used in the First Republic acquisition, predominantly offset by proceeds from paydowns and maturities of investment securities and from sales and securitizations of loans held-for- investment. Financing activities • In 2024, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, higher deposits, and net proceeds from long-and short-term borrowings, partially offset by net redemption of preferred stock. • In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and higher beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, largely offset by net outflows in deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 15– 16, Capital Risk Management on pages 44-49, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 93 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 102–109 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows. 17 EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 89-93. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment l e v e l . T h e s e n o n - G A A P m e a s u r e s i n c l u d e : • Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs; • Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense; • Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding Markets; • TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and • Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non- GAAP financial measures.

Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed basis. The following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments/businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 77-82 for additional information. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 47, and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 65–85 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies. 20 Segment results – managed basis The following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated.

(d) In the second quarter of 2023, substantially all of the expense associated with First Republic was reported in Corporate. Commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the expense has been aligned to the appropriate LOB. 22 Quarterly results Net income was $4.0 billion, down 31%. Net revenue was $17.8 billion, down 3%. Net interest income was $13.6 billion, down 6%, driven by: • lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"), reflecting deposit margin compression and lower average deposits, partially offset by • higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.2 billion, up 6%, driven by: • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels, and • higher card income, reflecting higher annual fees and higher net interchange on increased debit and credit card sales volume, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income, asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 84-86 for additional information on the credit card rewards liability. Noninterest expense was $9.6 billion, up 5%, reflecting: • higher compensation expense, predominantly driven by advisors, bankers, and technology employees, and • higher noncompensation expense, driven by continued investments in marketing, and higher operating losses, partially offset by lower auto lease depreciation. The provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion, reflecting: • net charge-offs of $1.9 billion, up $520 million, driven by $541 million in Card Services, primarily due to the seasoning of newer vintages and continued credit normalization, and • an $876 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses, primarily in Card Services, driven by growth in revolving balances and changes in certain macroeconomic variables. The provision in the prior year was $1.4 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and a $47 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 58-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses. Year-to-date results Net income was $13.1 billion, down 20%. Net revenue was $53.1 billion, up 2%. Net interest income was $41.0 billion, flat when compared with the prior year, reflecting: • higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, and • the timing impact of First Republic in Home Lending, offset by • lower NII in BWM, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower average deposits. Noninterest revenue was $12.2 billion, up 9%, predominantly driven by: • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels, including the timing impact of First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net inflows, as well as higher commissions from annuity sales in BWM, • higher card income driven by higher net interchange on increased debit and credit card sales volume, as well as higher annual fees, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, and • higher production revenue in Home Lending, including the timing impact of First Republic. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 9–14 and Note 26 for additional information on First Republic. Noninterest expense was $28.3 billion, up 11%, reflecting First Republic-related expense that was aligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third quarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and noncompensation expense. The increase in expense also reflected: • higher compensation expense, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation predominantly for advisors and bankers, and an increase in employees, including in technology, and • higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by continued investments in marketing and technology, and higher operating losses.

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 75 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information. For the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.4 billion, down 5%. Net revenue was $5.4 billion, up 9%. Net interest income was $1.6 billion, up 4%. Noninterest revenue was $3.8 billion, up 11%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.5 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by: • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels and strong net inflows, and • investment valuation gains compared with losses in the prior year. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.9 billion, up 3%, driven by: • higher net interest income, driven by higher average deposits predominantly associated with First Republic which were transferred to AWM from CCB in the fourth quarter of 2023, largely offset by deposit margin compression reflecting higher rates paid, and narrower loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was relatively flat, reflecting higher management fees due to higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage fees, offset by the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic that have expired. Noninterest expense was $3.6 billion, up 16%, predominantly driven by: • higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in private banking advisor teams, and • higher legal expense and distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was $4 million. The provision in the prior year was a net benefit of $13 million. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on lending related fees. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 58-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 73-75 for 35 further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses. Year-to-date results Net income was $3.9 billion, down 3%. Net revenue was $15.8 billion, up 7%. Net interest income was $4.9 billion, up 5%. Noninterest revenue was $10.9 billion, up 8%. Revenue from Asset Management was $7.3 billion, up 8%, driven by: • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels and strong net inflows, and • higher performance fees. The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $8.5 billion, up 6%, driven by: • higher noninterest revenue, reflecting: – higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage fees, largely offset by – the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and • higher net interest income, predominantly driven by higher loans associated with First Republic and wider spreads on loans. Deposit revenue was relatively flat as higher average deposits associated with First Republic which were transferred to AWM from CCB in the fourth quarter of 2023 were offset by margin compression reflecting higher rates paid. Noninterest expense was $10.6 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by: • higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in private banking advisor teams, and • higher legal expense and distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $33 million. The provision in the prior year was $160 million, reflecting a $146 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 36 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except ranking data, ratios and employees) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change % of JPM mutual fund assets and ETFs rated as 4- or 5-star(a) 70 % 70 % 70 % 70 % % of JPM mutual fund assets and ETFs ranked in 1st or 2nd quartile:(b) 1 year 70 39 70 39 3 years 75 67 75 67 5 years 73 81 73 81 Selected balance sheet data (period-end)(c) Total assets $ 253,750 $ 249,866 2 % $ 253,750 $ 249,866 2 % Loans 233,903 228,114 3 233,903 228,114 3 Deposits(d) 248,984 215,152 16 248,984 215,152 16 Equity 15,500 17,000 (9) 15,500 17,000 (9) Selected balance sheet data (average)(c) Total assets $ 247,768 $ 245,616 1 $ 243,784 $ 237,870 2 Loans 229,299 223,760 2 225,630 218,278 3 Deposits(d) 236,470 201,975 17 230,560 212,652 8 Equity 15,500 17,000 (9) 15,500 16,560 (6) Employees 29,112 28,083 4 29,112 28,083 4 Number of Global Private Bank client advisors 3,753 3,443 9 3,753 3,443 9 Credit data and quality statistics(c) Net charge-offs/(recoveries) $ 12 $ 1 NM $ 23 $ 1 NM Nonaccrual loans 764 621 23 764 621 23 Allowance for credit losses: Allowance for loan losses $ 566 $ 642 (12) $ 566 $ 642 (12) Allowance for lending-related commitments 38 32 19 38 32 19 Total allowance for credit losses $ 604 $ 674 (10) $ 604 $ 674 (10) Net charge-off/(recovery) rate 0.02 % — % 0.01 % — % Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans 0.24 0.28 0.24 0.28 Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans 74 103 74 103 Nonaccrual loans to period-end loans 0.33 0.27 0.33 0.27 (a) Represents the Morningstar Rating for all domiciled funds except for Japan domiciled funds which use Nomura.

Commencing in the third quarter of 2023, the expense has been aligned to the appropriate LOBs. (h) Income taxes associated with the First Republic acquisition were reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain. Quarterly results Net income was $1.8 billion, compared with $812 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $3.1 billion, compared with $1.6 billion in the prior year. Net interest income was $2.9 billion, up 47%, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio. Noninterest revenue was $155 million, compared with a loss of $425 million in the prior year, driven by: • lower net investment securities losses associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO, and • an increase associated with other equity investments, primarily driven by a net gain compared to a net loss in the prior year related to Visa shares, partially offset by • the absence of the prior-year adjustment to the estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition. Noninterest expense was $589 million, down 15%, predominantly driven by lower restructuring costs associated with the First Republic. The current period income tax expense was driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses 40 subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio. Year-to-date results Net income was $9.3 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in the prior year. Net revenue was $15.4 billion, compared with $6.3 billion in the prior year. Net interest income was $7.8 billion, up 42%, primarily due to the impact of balance sheet mix, reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, and higher rates. Noninterest revenue was $7.6 billion, compared with $800 million in the prior year. Excluding the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and the prior-year $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition, revenue was up $1.7 billion, driven by: • lower investment securities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO, and • higher revenue associated with the Firm's international consumer initiatives, partially offset by • lower principal transactions revenue in Treasury and CIO. Noninterest expense was $3.4 billion, up 72%, driven by: • the $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024, • the $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024, and • higher costs associated with the Firm's international consumer initiatives, partially offset by • lower expense associated with the First Republic acquisition as substantially all the expense was reported in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently aligned to the appropriate LOBs starting in the third quarter of 2023, and • lower legal expense. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the FDIC special assessment. The provision for credit losses was $28 million. The provision in the prior year was $173 million, reflecting an addition to the allowance for credit losses related to a single name exposure. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio, and Note 12 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses. The current period income tax expense was predominantly driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, including the impact of the net gain on Visa shares and the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024. The prior year tax expense benefited from the income tax expense associated with the First Republic acquisition reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain. Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., Nutmeg, and an ownership stake in C6 Bank. 41 Treasury and CIO overview At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the average credit rating of the Treasury and CIO investment securities comprising the portfolio in the table below was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Risk governance framework The Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Refer to pages 86–89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. Risk governance and oversight functions The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2023 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

Refer to pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10- K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s capital risk. Basel III Overview The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), which are on- balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm's most binding constraint among the Basel III risk-based ratios is the Advanced Total Capital ratio. With respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratios, the Standardized ratios are more binding than the Advanced ratios. Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, calculate their SLR. Refer to page 47 of this Form 10-Q and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on SLR. In July 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity", which is referred to in this Form 10-Q as the "U.S. Basel III proposal". Under the proposal, changes to the framework would include replacement of the Advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other than for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk- based approach and the Standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. However, a speech given by the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair for Supervision in September 2024 indicated that a revised proposal could be issued with a delayed implementation date. Under the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new expanded risk-based approach, when fully phased-in, would be the Firm's binding constraint. The Firm is managing its CET1 capital in anticipation of the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal. Refer to page 92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the U.S. Basel III proposal. Refer to page 93 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for information on Other Key Regulatory Developments. 44 Selected capital and RWA data The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

Refer to pages 102–109 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand- alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, J u n e 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2023 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework. Three months ended Average amount (in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: HQLA Eligible cash(a) $ 412,389 $ 461,392 $ 402,663 Eligible securities(b)(c) 453,899 356,815 378,702 Total HQLA(d) $ 866,288 $ 818,207 $ 781,365 Net cash outflows $ 762,072 $ 732,179 $ 696,668 LCR 114 % 112 % 112 % Net excess eligible HQLA(d) $ 104,216 $ 86,028 $ 84,697 JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.: LCR 121 % 125 % 123 % Net excess eligible HQLA $ 168,137 $ 189,124 $ 167,096 (a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are included at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule. (d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, compared with the three months ended J u n e 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, driven by a dividend payment from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company and long-term debt issuances, partially offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, compared with three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company and long-term debt issuances, largely offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 decreased compared with the three months ended J u n e 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, primarily due to a dividend payment to the Parent Company, loan growth and a decline in deposits, partially offset by higher market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 decreased compared with the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, primarily due to a decline in deposits and dividend payments to the Parent Company, offset by debt issuances and FHLB advances, a reduction in unencumbered non- HQLA AFS securities, and higher market values of HQLA- eligible investment securities. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted. 50 Liquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $608 billion and $649 billion as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, was driven by decreases in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and in unencumbered AFS securities, largely offset by an increase in CIB trading assets. The Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively, comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately $868 billion and $798 billion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $608 billion and $649 billion, respectively. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $386 billion and $340 billion as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 primarily due to a higher amount of commercial loans and credit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. For the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's interpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 on the Firm’s website for additional information. 51 Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to page 67 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted. The following discussion excludes the impact of the transfer of certain First Republic deposits in the fourth quarter of 2023 from CCB to the other LOBs as the transfers had no net impact on Firmwide deposits. Average deposits increased for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB due to net inflows in Payments and Securities Services, and net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand in Markets, partially offset by deposit attrition, which included actions taken to reduce certain deposits, • an increase in AWM driven by new and existing product offerings, largely offset by continued migration into higher-yielding investments, • higher balances in Corporate as a result of certain higher- yielding programs that were launched in the second quarter of 2024, associated with the Firm's international consumer initiatives, and • a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due to increased customer spending, partially offset by new accounts. Average deposits increased for the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly in Payments and net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand in Markets, partially offset by deposit attrition, which included actions taken to reduce certain deposits, • the timing impact of First Republic, • higher balances in Corporate as a result of certain higher- yielding programs that were launched in the second quarter of 2024, associated with the Firm's international consumer initiatives, • an increase in AWM primarily driven by new and existing product offerings, predominantly offset by continued migration into higher-yielding investments, and • a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due to increased customer spending, partially offset by new accounts. 52 Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2023, reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB due to net inflows in Payments and Securities Services, partially offset by net maturities of structured notes in Markets, • an increase in AWM driven by new and existing product offerings, • higher balances in Corporate as a result of certain higher- yielding programs that were launched in the second quarter of 2024, associated with the Firm's international consumer initiatives, and • a decline in CCB in existing accounts primarily due to increased customer spending and migration into higher- yielding investments, largely offset by new accounts.

Refer to Note 3 for further information on structured notes. Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. Refer to pages 105–106 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm's total uninsured deposits. The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured funding is securities sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2024, compared with D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, driven by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making activities and higher secured financing of trading assets, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year- end. The increase in secured other borrowed funds at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 was predominantly due to higher financing requirements in Markets. For the average three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, compared to the prior year period, the increase was due to higher financing requirements in Markets, partially offset by maturities in Treasury and CIO. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. The decrease in commercial paper at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, and for the average three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year three-month period, was due to lower issuances primarily as a result of short-term liquidity management. The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, and for the average three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the prior year three-month period, was driven by higher net issuances of structured notes in CIB, due to client demand. 55 Long-term funding Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. Unsecured funding and issuance The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The increase in structured notes at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, and the increase in averages for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the same prior year periods, were primarily driven by net issuances in Markets due to client demand. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Secured funding and issuance The Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB advances. The following table summarizes the securitization issuance, the FHLB advances, and their respective maturities or redemptions, as applicable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Refer to Note 26 for more information. The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations. 56 Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Notes 4 and 13 for additional information. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, were as follows: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further information. (f) Includes billed interest and fees. (g) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB. 60 (h) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that reference certain pools of residential real estate and auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio. (i) Excludes mortgage loans past due and insured by U.S. government agencies, which are primarily 90 or more days past due. These loans have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies were $126 million and $182 million, respectively. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance. (j) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $18.7 billion and $14.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $17.0 billion and $12.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates. Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 driven by retained residential real estate loans. Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans decreased compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2023, predominantly driven by paydowns and loan sales, net of originations. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, predominantly driven by loan sales. Net recoveries were higher for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by loan sales. Loans held-for-sale increased from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, predominantly driven by a transfer of certain retained loans in anticipation of securitization. Nonaccrual loans held-for- sale decreased compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, driven by loan sales. Loans at fair value increased compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2023, driven by higher Home Lending loans as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales, and higher CIB loans as purchases outpaced sales. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, driven by net sales in CIB. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $89.4 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable to the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $14.5 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding included $3.9 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified, and $3.8 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for- sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Modified residential real estate loans For the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, residential real estate financial difficulty modifications ("FDMs") were $74 million and $188 million, respectively, and $43 million and $110 million for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. Loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, and loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings ("Chapter 7 loans"), were not material for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and Note 11 of this Form 10-Q for further information. 61 Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value, generally consists of prime- quality scored auto and business banking loans, other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, predominantly due to loan securitizations. Net charge-offs increased for the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the same period in the prior year, predominantly due to higher scored auto net charge-offs of $100 million, reflecting a decline in used vehicle valuations. Refer to Note 13 for further information on securitization activity. Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.

These loans have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies were $126 million and $182 million, respectively. Nonaccrual loans The following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023. Nonaccrual loan activity Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Beginning balance $ 4,203 $ 4,325 Additions 2,245 2,038 Reductions: Principal payments and other 697 755 Sales 716 179 Charge-offs 453 329 Returned to performing status 724 795 Foreclosures and other liquidations 145 131 Total reductions 2,735 2,189 Net changes (490) (151) Ending balance $ 3,713 $ 4,174 Refer to Note 11 for further information about the consumer credit portfolio, including information about delinquencies, other credit quality indicators, loan modifications and loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. 62 Credit card Total credit card loans increased from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving balances. The S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.20% and 1.10%, respectively, increased compared to the D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 30+ and 90+ delinquency rates of 2.14% and 1.05%, respectively, in line with expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting the seasoning of newer vintages and continued credit normalization. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies. Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans. Modified credit card loans For the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, credit card FDMs were $272 million and $714 million, respectively, and $197 million and $489 million for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. FDMs increased for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher delinquencies, reflecting growth in the portfolio. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and Note 11 of this Form 10-Q for further information. 63 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 66-69 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 8 for additional information. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, loans increased $23 billion, driven by higher loans in CIB and higher securities based lending in AWM. Lending-related commitments increased by $4.8 billion, driven by Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Consumer & Retail, including held- for-sale commitments, largely offset by decreases in Asset Managers and Individuals. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, nonperforming exposure increased by $1.7 billion, predominantly driven by Real Estate, concentrated in Office, and Technology, Media & Telecommunications, resulting from downgrades. For the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, wholesale net charge-offs were $511 million, predominantly in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, Individuals, Consumer & Retail and Industrials.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. (c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. (d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 65 Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $47.1 billion and $41.4 billion as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, representing approximately 3.7% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $47.1 billion, $42.7 billion was p e r f o r m i n g .

Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion on loans, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2024 and 2023. Since S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, nonaccrual loan exposure increased by $1.0 billion, driven by Real Estate, concentrated in Office, Technology, Media & Telecommunications, and Healthcare, resulting from downgrades, partially offset by a single name in Banks & Finance Companies.

The amortized cost of wholesale FDMs for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3 was $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of which $752 million and $884 million, respectively, was nonaccrual loan exposure. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K and Note 11 of this Form 10-Q for further information. 70 Lending-related commitments The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending- related commitments. Receivables from customers Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses. Derivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 87% at both S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2023. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $52.6 billion and $54.9 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative transactions. 71 The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.

In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of: • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 was $26.5 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.8 billion from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: • $1.5 billion in consumer, reflecting: – a $1.7 billion net addition in Card Services, due to loan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of newer vintages, and changes in certain macroeconomic variables, partially offset by – a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and • $196 million in wholesale, reflecting: – net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the impact of incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by – changes in certain macroeconomic variables and the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios. The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023 to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the third quarter of 2025, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at September 30, 2024 4Q24 2Q25 4Q25 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.4 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.9 % Central case assumptions at December 31, 2023 2Q24 4Q24 2Q25 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.1 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.8 % 0.7 % 1.0 % (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $631.7 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 40-42 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 77-82 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Principal investment risk Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve based on market circumstances and in line with its strategic initiatives, including the Firm’s environmental and social goals. The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2024 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. (in billions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Tax-oriented investments, primarily in alternative energy and affordable housing(a) $ 33.2 $ 28.8 Private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets 9.2 10.5 Total carrying value $ 42.4 $ 39.3 (a) Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance. Refer to Note 13 for additional information. Refer to page 134 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight. 76 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K. Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals. Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages 140–143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm. 77 The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

Prior periods have not been revised. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 20-21 for additional information. (b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components. (c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures. (d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to disaggregate AWM VaR due to the increase associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments. The VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. (e) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa C shares which the Firm disposed of in the second and third quarters of 2024. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 9–14 for additional information. Quarter over quarter results Average total VaR for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 decreased by $11 million, when compared with June 30, 2024, driven by decreases in Visa C share exposure in Corporate VaR, partially offset by increased risk exposure in fixed income. Year over year results Average total VaR for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 increased by $4 million, compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to increases associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments within Credit Portfolio VaR and AWM VaR, as well as the impact of Visa C shares to Corporate VaR, largely offset by volatility rolling out of the one-year historical look- back period impacting fixed income. 78 The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The increase in VaR and subsequent decline observed in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by changes in Visa C share exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR. Daily Risk Management VaR $ millions 0 25 50 75 100 Third Quarter 2023 Fourth Quarter 2023 First Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2024 VaR backtesting The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. For the 12 months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 162 of the 259 days, and observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 46 of the 66 days, and did not observe any VaR backtesting exceptions. The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions. Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses 79 Structural interest rate risk management The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities which are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-Risk One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long- term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure from non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising from the Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of the hedges in these simulations would increase U.S. dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 143 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for more information. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: • The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits. • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits. The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. In the second quarter of 2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid assumptions which take into account observed pricing and client and customer behavior during the most recent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates paid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, resulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in higher interest rate scenarios, and an increase in negative sensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information). 80 The Firm’s U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. (In billions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 U.S. dollar: Parallel shift: (a) +100 bps shift in rates $ 2.1 $ 2.4 -100 bps shift in rates (2.1) (2.1) +200 bps shift in rates 4.5 4.8 -200 bps shift in rates (4.8) (4.6) Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 1.5 0.6 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.7) (1.5) Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.6 1.8 -100 bps shift in long-term rates (1.4) (0.5) Non-U.S. dollar: Parallel shift: (a) +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.7 $ 0.7 -100 bps shift in rates (0.8) (0.7) (a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates. The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 compared to D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s actual and forecasted balance sheet and the update in the second quarter of 2024 of the deposit rates paid assumptions for certain consumer and wholesale deposit products based upon observed pricing and client and customer behavior during the most recent economic cycle. In the absence of this update, the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, would have been lower by approximately $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion to the +100 basis points and +200 basis points shifts, respectively, in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by approximately $900 million and $1.5 billion to the -100 basis points and -200 basis points shifts, respectively, in short-term and parallel rate scenarios. Economic Value Sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value disclosure. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 110 in Note 2 financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. 81 Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 144–145 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and their comparative exposures as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure to Germany when compared to December 31, 2023, was predominantly driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of Germany due to higher client deposits and client-driven market- making activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to Russia is not material. Refer to Note 24 on pages 181–182 for information concerning Russian litigation.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: • The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), • The allowance for lending-related commitments, and • The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-75 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio and geography. • Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI. • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI. Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was initially measured based on similar risk characteristics from other facilities underwritten by the Firm. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, the acquired portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's modeled credit loss estimates and is now reflected in the wholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight- quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.7% in the third quarter of 2025. This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: 84 • The allowance as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: • An increase of approximately $850 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of approximately $3.6 billion for credit card loans ▪ An increase of approximately $4.2 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information. September 30, 2024 (in millions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 368,964 $ — Securities borrowed 107,599 — Trading assets: Trading–debt and equity instruments 734,928 2,437 Derivative receivables(a) 52,561 10,710 Total trading assets 787,489 13,147 AFS securities 334,548 — Loans 42,137 2,487 MSRs 8,753 8,753 Other 13,367 1,186 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis 1,662,857 25,573 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 2,512 1,841 Total assets measured at fair value $ 1,665,369 $ 27,414 Total Firm assets $ 4,210,048 Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 1 % Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 2 % (a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $10.7 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the n e t t i n g a d j u s t m e n t a s s u c h n e t t i n g i s n o t r e l e v a n t t o a p r e s e n t a t i o n based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. 85 Valuation Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Credit card rewards liability The credit card rewards liability was $14.3 billion and $13.2 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2023, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to pages 157-158 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. Income taxes Refer to Income taxes on page 158 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. Goodwill impairment Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 157 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. Litigation reserves Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves. 86 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS FASB Standards Adopted since January 1, 2024 Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Fair Value Measurement: Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions Issued June 2022 • Clarifies that a contractual sale restriction is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. • Requires disclosure for investments in equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, including: 1) fair value of these investments, 2) nature and remaining duration of the restriction(s) and 3) circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restriction(s). • Adopted prospectively on January 1, 2024, with no impact to the Firm’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further discussion of the Firm's business segments. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the FDIC. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Note 26 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024 Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using the proportional amortization method. This method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a change to the classification and timing of the amortization associated with certain of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments. As a result of the adoption, the amortization of these investments that was previously recognized in other income is now being recognized in income tax expense. The change in accounting resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $161 million and increased the Firm’s income tax expense and the effective tax rate by approximately $450 million and two percentage points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net income. 94 The guidance requires additional disclosure for all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax-oriented investment program for which the Firm has elected to apply the proportional amortization method. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. Refer to Notes 5 and 13 for additional information. 95 Note 2 – Fair value measurement Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy. 96 The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2023, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

mortgage-related. (b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. 98 (c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $802 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, primarily reported in other assets. (e) At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, included $13.3 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.0 billion of commercial first-lien mortgages at both periods. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $5.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. (f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Level 3 valuations Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. 99 Level 3 inputs(a) September 30, 2024 Product/Instrument Fair value (in millions) Principal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g) Range of input values Average(i) Residential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b) $ 1,078 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% 89% 7% Prepayment speed 3% 14% 8% Conditional default rate 0% 6% 0% Loss severity 0% 110% 5% Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c) 1,495 Market comparables Price $0 $90 $82 Corporate debt securities 435 Market comparables Price $0 $175 $85 Loans(d) 1,440 Market comparables Price $0 $115 $80 Non-U.S. government debt securities 173 Market comparables Price $0 $104 $96 Net interest rate derivatives 2,821 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 7bps 555bps 111bps Interest rate spread volatility 37bps 77bps 65bps Bermudan switch value 0% 52% 17% Interest rate correlation (85)% 97% 63% IR-FX correlation (35)% 60% 5% 8 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 0% 21% 7% Net credit derivatives (130) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 30% 69% 48% Credit spread 0bps 2,999bps 341bps Recovery rate 10% 90% 57% 31 Market comparables Price $0 $115 $73 Net foreign exchange derivatives 89 Option pricing IR-FX correlation (40)% 60% 21% (49) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 11% 11% Interest rate curve 2% 49% 8% Net equity derivatives (3,810) Option pricing Forward equity price(h) 80% 144% 101% Equity volatility 4% 143% 32% Equity correlation 17% 100% 56% Equity-FX correlation (80)% 65% (32)% Equity-IR correlation 10% 18% 14% Net commodity derivatives (372) Option pricing Oil commodity forward $82 / BBL $266 / BBL $150 / BBL Natural gas commodity forward $1 / MMBTU $7 / MMBTU $3 / MMBTU Commodity volatility 2% 47% 5% Commodity correlation (35)% 98% (8)% MSRs 8,753 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 14 Long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e) 38,445 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 7bps 555bps 111bps Bermudan switch value 0% 52% 17% Interest rate correlation (85)% 97% 63% IR-FX correlation (35)% 60% 5% Equity volatility 2% 140% 28% Equity correlation 17% 100% 56% Equity-FX correlation (80)% 65% (32)% Equity-IR correlation 10% 18% 14% 894 Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 30% 69% 48% Credit spread 1bps 270bps 81bps Recovery rate 20% 40% 37% Yield 5% 20% 10% Loss severity 0% 100% 50% Other level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f) 1,375 (a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $691 million, nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $382 million. (c) Comprises nonagency securities of $11 million, trading loans of $65 million and non-trading loans of $1.4 billion. (d) Comprises trading loans of $754 million and non-trading loans of $686 million. (e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) Includes equity securities of $737 million including $636 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price- based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. (h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price. (i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used. 100 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments. 101 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Three months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Fair value at July 1, 2024 Total realized/ unrealized

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2023, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 108 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 Level 3 assets were $25.6 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, flat when compared to June 30, 2024, and reflecting an increase of $1.9 billion from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. The increase for the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2024 was predominantly driven by higher: • Gross derivative receivables of $ 1 . 8 b i l l i o n due to gains, purchases and net transfers largely offset by settlements. Refer to the sections below for additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. For the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 8 4 1 m i l l i o n and $ 1 . 1 b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 7 6 5 m i l l i o n and $ 1 . 3 b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 1 . 8 b i l l i o n of gross interest rate derivative payables as a result of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate options. • $ 1 . 2 b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative receivables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1 . 2 b i l l i o n of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 1 . 7 b i l l i o n and $ 1 . 2 b i l l i o n of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/ or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. 106 Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 101–106 for further information on these instruments. Three months ended September 30, 2024 • $1.3 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net derivative receivables due to market movements. • $1.8 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Three months ended September 30, 2023 • $1.7 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $788 million of net gains on liabilities, driven by gains in long-term debt due to market movements. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 • $1.1 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net derivative receivables and loans due to market movements as well as MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $2.3 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Nine months ended September 30, 2023 • $ 1 . 9 b i l l i o n of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $ 1 . 0 b i l l i o n of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Of the $945 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, $590 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. Also, included impairments on certain equity method investments. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value adjustments have been recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Loans $ (32) $ (75) $ (98) $ (200) Other assets(a) (323) (376) (529) (536) Accounts payable and other liabilities — — — — Total nonrecurring fair value gains/(losses) $ (355) $ (451) $ (627) $ (736) (a) Included $(30) million and $33 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $(176) million and $(60) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of net gains/(losses) as a result of the measurement alternative. The current period also included impairments on certain equity method investments. 108 Equity securities without readily determinable fair values The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, As of or for the period ended, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other assets Carrying value(a) $ 3,660 $ 4,499 $ 3,660 $ 4,499 Upward carrying value changes(b) 42 50 72 90 Downward carrying value changes/impairment(c) (72) (17) (248) (150) (a) The carrying value as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 was $4.5 billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes. (b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 were $1.1 billion. (c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 were $(1.5) billion. Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6 million Visa Class B-2 common shares ("Visa B-2 shares") and 3 7 . 2 m i l l i o n Visa Class B common shares reflected in the Firm's principal investment portfolio as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. The Visa Class B common shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) on January 24, 2024. On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa B-1 shares. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 3 7 . 2 m i l l i o n Visa B-1 shares in exchange for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”). As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm had disposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales and through a donation to the Firm's Foundation. The Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. On October 11, 2024 Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5875 to 1.5430 effective September 26, 2024 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis. In connection with prior sales of Visa Class B common shares prior to the redenomination to Visa B-1 shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative instruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. Refer to page 194 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information. 109 Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. (b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(c) As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, includes fair value adjustments associated with First Republic for other unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling $ 7 6 9 m i l l i o n and $ 1 . 1 b i l l i o n, respectively, recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Notes 22 and 26 for additional information. The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 177 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments. 110 Note 3 – Fair value option The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. (c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $10.2 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $37 million and $97 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments. 113 Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk component The following table presents the fair value of structured notes, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts. While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is simply a reference amount used to calculate payments. 116 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated balance sheets The following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.

Refer to Note 3 for further information. (b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. 117 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • c o l l a t e r a l t h a t c o n s i s t s o f l i q u i d s e c u r i t i e s a n d o t h e r c a s h c o l l a t e r a l h e l d a t t h i r d - p a r t y c u s t o d i a n s , w h i c h a r e s h o w n s e p a r a t e l y a s “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. (c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $44.7 billion and $48.3 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 15,954 $ 14,655 Collateral posted 15,871 14,673 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 65 $ 1,056 $ 75 $ 1,153 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 85 576 93 592 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. 120 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. (f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross- currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 121 As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield. Carrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b) Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items: September 30, 2024 (in millions) Active hedging relationships(d) Discontinued hedging relationships(d)(e) Total Assets Investment securities - AFS $ 179,277 (c) $ 3,001 $ (1,815) $ 1,186 Liabilities Long-term debt 215,891 1,204 (9,493) (8,289) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 2,363 20 (6) 14 Carrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b) Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items: December 31, 2023 (in millions) Active hedging relationships(d) Discontinued hedging relationships(d)(e) Total Assets Investment securities - AFS $ 151,752 (c) $ 549 $ (2,010) $ (1,461) Liabilities Long-term debt 195,455 (2,042) (9,727) (11,769) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs — — — — (a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $3.1 billion and $5.6 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $34.5 billion and $19.3 billion, respectively. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt was $556 million and zero, respectively. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $61.3 billion and $83.9 billion, of which $56.2 billion and $68.0 billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $328 million and $(165) million, which is comprised of $694 million and $73 million for active hedging relationships, and $(366) million and $(238) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 9 for additional information. (d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods. (e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships. 122 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (716) $ 2,071 $ 2,787 Foreign exchange(b) 43 242 199 Total $ (673) $ 2,313 $ 2,986 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended September 30, 2023 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (514) $ (1,087) $ (573) Foreign exchange(b) 71 (122) (193) Total $ (443) $ (1,209) $ (766) Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (1,998) $ (330) $ 1,668 Foreign exchange(b) 81 198 117 Total $ (1,917) $ (132) $ 1,785 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Nine months ended September 30, 2023 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (1,416) $ (1,825) $ (409) Foreign exchange(b) 25 64 39 Total $ (1,391) $ (1,761) $ (370) (a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.2) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately six years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 123 Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income. (b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income associated with net investment hedges. The Firm reclassified a net pre-tax gain of $36 million and $46 million to other income/expense during the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, respectively. During the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, the Firm reclassified a pre-tax loss of $(38) million to other income/expense predominantly related to the acquisition of CIFM. The amounts reclassified for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3 were not material. Refer to Note 19 for further information. 124 Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 122 $ (259) $ (123) $ (385) Credit(b) (143) (39) (424) (202) Foreign exchange(c) 4 (22) 32 21 Total $ (17) $ (320) $ (515) $ (566) (a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue. 125 Credit derivatives Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB. (c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. Also includes credit protection against certain loans and lending-related commitments in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $52 million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $694 million at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $123 million at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. (c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven years for agency residential MBS, six years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 135 Note 10 – Securities financing activities Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. 137 Note 11 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale(c)(d) • Residential real estate(a) • Auto and other(b) • Credit card loans • Secured by real estate • Commercial and industrial • Other(e) (a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB. (b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB. (c) Includes loans held in CIB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. (d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower. (e) Includes loans to SPEs, financial institutions, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs. The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $181 million and $1.9 billion for the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, respectively, and $465 million and $4.2 billion for the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. (d) Includes loans acquired in the First Republic acquisition consisting of $91.9 billion in Consumer, excluding credit card and $58.4 billion in Wholesale. Gains and losses on sales of loans Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending- related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 were $65 million and $125 million, respectively, of which $ 4 7 m i l l i o n and $ 8 0 m i l l i o n, respectively, were related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3 were $ 9 m i l l i o n and $ 4 6 m i l l i o n, respectively, of which $ 9 m i l l i o n and $ 5 2 m i l l i o n, respectively, were related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. 139 Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. These loans include home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.

(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated. Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period. 141 Nonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators The following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential real estate loans.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due. (b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. (c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative. (d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $38 million and $44 million and $123 million and $133 million for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, respectively. (e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality. (h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. (i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available. (j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4. 142 Loan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than- insignificant payment deferral and principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2023 Form 10-K for further information. Financial effects of FDMs For the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, residential real estate FDMs were $74 million and $188 million, respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 8 years for both periods, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.78% to 5.78% and 7.81% to 5.37% for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, respectively. For the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, residential real estate FDMs were $43 million and $110 million, respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 22 years and 19 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.22% to 4.63% and 7.04% to 4.24% for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and December 31, 2023, there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. For the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, loans subject to a trial modification, where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, and Chapter 7 loans were not material. Payment status of FDMs The following table provides information on the payment status of FDMs during the twelve months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3.

(b) At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had an allowance for credit losses of $ 2 7 7 m i l l i o n and $ 1 7 m i l l i o n, respectively, associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB. (c) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual risk-rated loans. (d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (e) At S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, lending-related commitments excluded $18.6 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $989.6 billion and $898.9 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $26.6 billion and $16.2 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. 155 Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 was $26.5 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.8 billion from D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: • $1.5 billion in consumer, reflecting: – a $1.7 billion net addition in Card Services, due to loan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of newer vintages, and changes in certain macroeconomic variables, partially offset by – a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and • $196 million in wholesale, reflecting: – net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, and the impact of incorporating the First Republic portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by – changes in certain macroeconomic variables and the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios. The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023 to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the third quarter of 2025, and a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at September 30, 2024 4Q24 2Q25 4Q25 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.5 % 4.6 % 4.4 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.9 % Central case assumptions at December 31, 2023 2Q24 4Q24 2Q25 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.1 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.8 % 0.7 % 1.0 % (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods. Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 84-86 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments. 156 Note 13 – Variable interest entities Refer to Note 1 and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm's accounting policies regarding consolidation of and involvement with VIEs. The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

Refer to pages 160–161 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties. Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm- sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. 157 The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB. (c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $5.5 billion and $3.1 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. (f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $34.9 billion and $35.1 billion at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, of which $15.0 billion and $14.7 billion was unfunded at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments. Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method guidance which expanded the types of tax-oriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by program basis, to be accounted for using the proportional amortization method. Refer to Note 1 for further information. 160 The proportional amortization method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. In addition, under this method deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity contributions that are unconditional and legally binding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period, there were no significant modifications or events that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. The following table provides information on tax-oriented investments for which the Firm elected to apply the proportional amortization method. As of or for the period ended, (in millions) Alternative energy and affordable housing programs(d) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Programs for which the Firm elected proportional amortization: Carrying value(a) $ 31,778 $ 13,800 $ 31,778 $ 13,800 Tax credits and other tax benefits(b) 1,280 532 4,067 1,478 Investments that qualify to be accounted for using proportional amortization: Amortization losses recognized as a component of income tax expense (1,006) (417) (3,157) (1,161) Non-income-tax-related gains and other returns received that are recognized outside of income tax expense(c) 28 — 96 (1) (a) Recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. Excludes programs to which the Firm does not apply the proportional amortization method, such as historic tax credit and new market tax credit programs. (b) Reflected in Income tax expense on the Consolidated statements of income and Operating activities on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. (c) Recorded in Other income on the Consolidated statements of income and Operating activities on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. (d) As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of eligible affordable housing investments was $14.6 billion. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 was $5.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3 was $7.8 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. 161 Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

(b) Primarily includes Level 2 assets. (c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. (d) Represents prime mortgages. Excludes loan securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies. (e) Includes commercial mortgage and auto loans. Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Carrying value of loans sold $ 7,132 $ 5,582 $ 18,298 $ 14,603 Proceeds received from loan sales as cash 385 119 751 159 Proceeds from loan sales as securities(a)(b) 6,695 5,397 17,386 14,279 Total proceeds received from loan sales(c) $ 7,080 $ 5,516 $ 18,137 $ 14,438 Gains/(losses) on loan sales(d)(e) $ — $ — $ — $ — (a) Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt or retained as part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. (b) Included in level 2 assets. (c) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. (d) Gains/(losses) on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (e) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. 162 Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Loans repurchased or option to repurchase(a) $ 715 $ 597 Real estate owned 7 8 Foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans(b) 7 22 (a) Primarily all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. (b) Relates to voluntary repurchases of loans, which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable. Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about components of and delinquencies related to nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing involvement as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is the Firm’s only form of continuing involvement, the Firm generally experiences a loss only if the Firm was required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with its loan sale or servicing contracts. Net liquidation losses/(recoveries) Securitized assets 90 days past due Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Securitized loans Residential mortgage: Prime / Alt-A & option ARMs $ 48,312 $ 39,319 $ 491 $ 440 $ 2 $ 2 $ 9 $ 12 Subprime 1,438 1,312 105 131 1 1 2 5 Commercial and other 120,205 120,262 1,337 2,874 14 40 33 59 Total loans securitized $ 169,955 $ 160,893 $ 1,933 $ 3,445 $ 17 $ 43 $ 44 $ 76 163 Note 14 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other intangible assets Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other intangible assets. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and can be adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as additional information pertaining to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate. (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Consumer & Community Banking $ 32,116 $ 32,116 Commercial & Investment Bank 11,259 11,251 Asset & Wealth Management 8,596 8,582 Corporate 740 685 Total goodwill $ 52,711 $ 52,634 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Balance at beginning of period $ 52,620 $ 52,380 $ 52,634 $ 51,662 Changes during the period from: Business combinations(a) — 166 29 853 Other(b) 91 (54) 48 (23) Balance at September 30, $ 52,711 $ 52,492 $ 52,711 $ 52,492 (a) For the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, includes estimated goodwill associated with the acquisition of LayerOne Financial in CIB in the first quarter. For the three months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, represents an adjustment to goodwill related to the acquisition of CIFM in AWM. For the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 3, represents estimated goodwill associated with the acquisition of Aumni Inc. in the second quarter, predominantly in CIB, and the acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM in AWM in the first quarter. (b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments. Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4, or D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 or 2023. 164 Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023. As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fair value at beginning of period $ 8,847 $ 8,229 $ 8,522 $ 7,973 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 75 81 228 191 Purchase of MSRs(a) 282 569 607 1,036 Disposition of MSRs 2 (101) (e) (25) (e) (191) (e) Net additions/(dispositions) 359 549 810 1,036 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (272) (265) (795) (760) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) (251) 555 134 816 Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) 95 (26) 102 (24) Discount rates 14 14 14 14 Prepayment model changes and other(c) (39) 53 (34) 54 Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions 70 41 82 44 Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions (181) 596 216 860 Fair value at September 30, $ 8,753 $ 9,109 $ 8,753 $ 9,109 Changes in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at September 30, $ (181) $ 596 $ 216 $ 860 Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 396 409 1,190 1,185 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at September 30, (in billions) 658 639 658 639 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at September 30(d) 501 557 501 557 (a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. (e) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. 165 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and nine months ended S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and 2023. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 CCB mortgage fees and related income Production revenue $ 154 $ 162 $ 441 $ 339 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 409 409 1,226 1,211 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (273) (265) (795) (760) Total operating revenue 136 144 431 451 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a) (251) 555 134 816 Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b) 70 41 82 44 Changes in derivative fair value and other 281 (485) (78) (736) Total risk management 100 111 138 124 Total net mortgage servicing revenue 236 255 569 575 Total CCB mortgage fees and related income 390 417 1,010 914 All other 12 (3) 15 (1) Mortgage fees and related income $ 402 $ 414 $ 1,025 $ 913 (a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates) Sep 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate) 6.62 % 6.29 % Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (216) $ (206) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (420) (401) Weighted-average option adjusted spread(a) 6.20 % 6.10 % Impact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change $ (376) $ (369) Impact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change (721) (709) (a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital. 166 Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits. The Firm’s intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed periodically for impairment. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, other intangible assets consisted of finite-lived intangible assets of $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as well as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $1.2 billion at both periods. 167 Note 15 – Deposits Refer to Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on deposits. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows: (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 U.S. offices Noninterest-bearing (included $47,974 and $75,393 at fair value)(a) $ 611,334 $ 643,748 Interest-bearing (included $747 and $573 at fair value)(a) 1,326,489 1,303,100 Total deposits in U.S. offices 1,937,823 1,946,848 Non-U.S. offices Noninterest-bearing (included $2,272 and $1,737 at fair value)(a) 31,607 23,097 Interest-bearing (included $291 and $681 at fair value)(a) 461,342 430,743 Total deposits in non-U.S. offices 492,949 453,840 Total deposits $ 2,430,772 $ 2,400,688 (a) Includes structured notes classified as deposits for which the fair value option has been elected.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2 . 9 b i l l i o n CECL capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining benefit of $ 7 2 0 m i l l i o n and $ 1 . 4 b i l l i o n, respectively, associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. Similarly, as of January 1, 2024, the Firm has phased out 75% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions. 174 The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. 176 Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments Contractual amount Carrying value(h)(i) September 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Sep 30, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 By remaining maturity (in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after 1 year through 3 years Expires after 3 years through 5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total Lending-related Consumer, excluding credit card: Residential Real Estate(a) $ 10,843 $ 7,347 $ 5,046 $ 8,204 $ 31,440 $ 30,125 $ 563 (j) $ 678 (j) Auto and other 10,261 18 — 3,603 13,882 15,278 55 (j) 148 (j) Total consumer, excluding credit card 21,104 7,365 5,046 11,807 45,322 45,403 618 826 Credit card(b) 989,594 — — — 989,594 915,658 — — Total consumer(c) 1,010,698 7,365 5,046 11,807 1,034,916 961,061 618 826 Wholesale: Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(d) 107,885 202,960 172,960 24,492 508,297 503,526 2,695 (j) 2,797 (j) Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(d) 15,995 9,386 3,367 477 29,225 28,872 484 479 Other letters of credit(d) 3,596 305 36 101 4,038 4,388 38 37 Total wholesale(c) 127,476 212,651 176,363 25,070 541,560 536,786 3,217 3,313 Total lending-related $ 1,138,174 $ 220,016 $ 181,409 $ 36,877 $ 1,576,476 $ 1,497,847 $ 3,835 $ 4,139 Other guarantees and commitments Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(e) $ 334,224 $ — $ — $ — $ 334,224 $ 283,664 $ — $ — Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 1,554 327 10,311 40,957 53,149 54,562 67 89 Unsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 153,695 267 — — 153,962 95,106 2 — Unsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 94,694 568 — — 95,262 60,724 (3) — Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications: Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 45 76 Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 961 803 21 24 Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments(f) 268,646 — — — 268,646 265,887 — — Other guarantees and commitments(g) 10,837 742 267 833 12,679 15,074 29 38 (a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (e) As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $355.7 billion and $300.3 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies. (f) As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses.

(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value includes the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value. (i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts or premiums that are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Deferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected to fund, are amortized to lending- and deposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred amounts remain deferred until the commitment funds or is sold. (j) As of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, includes fair value adjustments associated with First Republic for residential real estate lending- related commitments totaling $505 million and $630 million, respectively, for auto and other lending-related commitments totaling $55 million and $148 million, respectively, and for other unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling $769 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 26 for additional information. 177 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3.

Refer to Note 11 for further information on internal risk ratings. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives. The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of S e p t e m b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 and D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3. (in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Notional amounts Derivative guarantees $ 53,149 $ 54,562 Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 32,548 32,488 Maximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 1,660 1,652 Fair value Derivative payables 67 89 In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation. 178 Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 177. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 177 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral. Pledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets. (in billions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 181.5 $ 145.0 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 307.9 244.2 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 692.5 675.6 Total pledged assets $ 1,181.9 $ 1,064.8 Total pledged assets do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt. Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. (in billions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,664.3 $ 1,303.9 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,274.2 982.8 179 Note 24 – Litigation Contingencies As of September 30, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $ 1 . 7 b i l l i o n at September 30, 2024. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 3 0 0 m i l l i o n and $ 5 0 0 m i l l i o n, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a new claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to hear both appeals in December 2024. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 3 1 . 5 m i l l i o n, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions 180 that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and putative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network. The Firm is responding to inquiries from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding the transfers of funds through the Zelle Network. In connection with this, the CFPB Staff has informed the Firm that it is authorized to pursue a resolution of the inquiries or file an enforcement action. The Firm is evaluating next steps, including litigation. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately $ 6 . 2 b i l l i o n. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $ 7 0 0 m i l l i o n has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering next steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa- branded payment card sales volume. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. Plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit filed in November 2023 remains pending. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment against the Firm in five claims, including one for $ 4 3 9 m i l l i o n. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. One judgment in the amount of $ 1 4 m i l l i o n was executed in July 2024 against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian 181 courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination of certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged the freeze orders in the Russian courts and, in one claim, also in a New York federal court action, in response to which a Russian court then issued an order instructing the Firm to discontinue that New York action. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets could also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. SEC Inquiries. The Firm is responding to requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm continues to cooperate and is currently engaged in advanced resolution discussions with the SEC with respect to most matters. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in resolutions. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The court has granted final approval of the settlement in this action. Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. Trading Venues Investigations. The Firm responded to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm self- identified that certain trading and order data through the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms. The Firm entered into resolutions with the OCC and the Board of Governors of the FRB in March 2024 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in May 2024. The resolutions required the Firm to, among other things, pay aggregate civil penalties of $ 4 5 0 m i l l i o n, which the Firm has paid, and to complete the Firm’s ongoing remediation. The Firm also engaged an independent compliance consultant, which completed an assessment of the Firm's trade surveillance program as required by the resolutions. The Firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $259 million and $665 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 182 resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. 183 Note 25 – Business segments The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments: Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed basis. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of M a y 1 , 2 0 2 3. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. The First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects adjustments made during the one-year measurement period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize management's fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including an increase of $103 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Certain matters related to the final settlement remain outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. Any subsequent adjustments will not impact the final bargain purchase gain and will be reflected in Other income. Refer to Note 34 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2023 Form 10-K for further information on the First Republic acquisition. 186 The computation of the purchase price, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition and the related bargain purchase gain are presented below, and reflects adjustments made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair value of the net assets acquired.

(c) Includes $ 4 4 7 m i l l i o n of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date. (d) Other assets include $ 1 . 2 b i l l i o n in tax-oriented investments and $683 million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $ 6 6 9 m i l l i o n and lease liabilities of $748 million.

Loans The following table presents the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") and fair values of the loans acquired as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments made during the measurement period to the acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired.

Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments. The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 3, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 16, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. O c t o b e r 3 0 , 2 0 2 4 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 189 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

CLTV: Combined loan-to-value CMT: Constant Maturity Treasury Collateral-dependent: A loan is considered to be collateral- dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is deemed probable based on borrower delinquency. Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions. Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee. Criticized: Criticized loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables that are classified as special mention, substandard and doubtful categories for regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

Morgan SE LCR: Liquidity coverage ratio LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate LLC: Limited Liability Company LOB: Line of business LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Macro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates, Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets.

Markets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).

Through Merchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies. MEV: Macroeconomic variable Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 194 converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. MREL: Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities MSR: Mortgage servicing rights NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NFA: National Futures Association NM: Not meaningful Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis.

Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Association (“SBA”) PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority Preferred stock dividends: reflects dividends declared and deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred stock 195 Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Global Funds: clients include financial intermediaries and individual investors. Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance: Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.- domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class. 199 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
