(NYSE: JPM) today reported 2006 third-quarter net income of $3.3 billion, or $0.92 per share compared with net income of $2.5 billion, or $0.71 per share, for the third quart er of 2005. The prior-year quarter includes a special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina of $248 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share. In addition, after-tax merger expe nses of $30 million and $137 million were recorded in each period, respectively. Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with our results, as earnings improved substantially versus the prior year. It is gratifying th at our focus on improving each of our businesses is becoming evident, although we still have much work to do. Earnings benefited from record Investment Banking fees and stro ng markets results as well as from continued improvement in the Corporate segment. Reta il Banking’s performance was affected by weak results in Mortgage Banking. Key business driver s, such as assets under management, assets under custody, credit card account s and sales volume, checking ac counts and loans, all showed continued momentum. Our overall results con tinue to benefit from a favorable credit environment, which we do not expect to continue . We continue to focus our business planning around a return to normal, or even adverse, credit conditions across all our businesses.” Commenting on other developmen ts, Mr. Dimon noted, “We successfully completed our New York Tri-state consumer conversion, which was one of the most complex conversions ever in the banking industry and a critical milestone for ach ieving our merger efficiency goal. We now have linked over 2,600 branches in 17 states on a common systems platform. The effort, dedication and teamwork of the conversion t eam now will be turned toward the recently acquired Bank of New York branches, which will be converted and refurbished beginning in the spring of 2007.” JPMorgan Chase & Co.

INVESTMENT BANK (IB) Results for IB 2Q06 3Q05 ($ millions) 3Q06 2Q06 3Q05 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net Revenue $4,673 $4,184 $4,471 $489 12% $202 5% Provision for Credit Losses 7 (62) (46) 69 NM 53 NM Noninterest Expense 3,101 2,946 2,877 155 5 224 8 Net Income $976 $839 $1,068 $137 16% ($92) (9)% Discussion of Results: Net income of $976 million was driven by record third-quarter revenues. Compared with the prior year, net income decreased by $92 million, or 9%, reflecting higher compensation expense and a higher provision for credit losses, larg ely offset by increased revenue. Net income increased by $137 million, or 16% compared with the prior quarter driven by increased revenue, partially offset by increased compensation and a higher provision for credit losses. Net revenue of $4.7 billion, the seco nd highest level ever posted, wa s up 5% from the prior year and 12% from the prior quarter. Investment banking fees of $1.4 billion were a record, up 44% from the prior year, driven by record debt underw riting and strong advisory fees, which were the highest since 2000. Advisory fees of $436 million were up 45% over the prior year driven by strong performance in the Americas and Europe . Debt underwriting fees of $708 million were up 49% from the prior year driven by record lo an syndication fees and strong bond underwriting fees, with strength in the Americas and Europe . Equity underwriting fees of $275 million were up 31% from the prior year driven by improved mark et share. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $2.4 billion was down 3% from the pr ior year’s record le vel. The current qua rter included very strong results in commodities. Equity Ma rkets revenue of $612 million decreased 14%, reflecting lower trading results compared with a strong prior-year quarte r, partially offset by strength in commissions. Credit Portfolio revenue of $272 million was down 18%, primarily reflecting lower gains from loan workouts and loan sales. Provision for credit losses was $7 million for the quarter compared with a benefit of $46 million in the prior year and a benefit of $62 million in the prior quarter. The increase reflects portfolio activity and stable credit quality. Noninterest expense was $3.1 billion, up by $224 m illion, or 8%, from the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher performa nce-based compensation, including the impact of an increase in the ratio of compensation expens e to total net revenue and incremental expense related to SFAS 123R.

Average loans retained of $61.6 billion were up by $14.2 billion, or 30%, from the prior year and up by $2.6 billion, or 4% , from the prior quarter. Average loans held-for-sale of $24.0 billion were up by $11.3 billion, or 89%, from the prior year and up by $4.1 billion, or 21%, from the prior quarter. These increases were driven largely by capital markets-related activity.  Allowance for loan losses to average loans was 1.64% for the current quarter, down from 2.11% in the prior year; nonperforming assets were $456 million, down 51% from the prior year and down 13% from the prior quarter.  Return on Equity was 18% on $21 billion of allocated capital.

Discussion of Results: Net income of $746 million was up by $90 million, or 14%, from the prior year. Excluding the prior-year impact of the $155 million (after-tax) sp ecial provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina, net income would have be en down by $65 million, or 8%. The decrease reflected a decline in Mortgage Banking results, partially offset by improved results in Regional Banking and Auto Finance. Compared with the prior quarter, net income was down, primarily due to a decline in Mortgage Banking results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 Net revenue of $3.6 billion was down by $35 million, or 1%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was down 2% due to the sale of the insura nce business during the quarter, lower auto loan and lease balances, narrower sp reads on loans and deposits in Regional Banking and decreased revenue in Mortgage Banking. These declines were offset partially by the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances in Regiona l Banking. Noninterest revenue of $1.1 billion was up by $20 million, or 2%, driven by increases in deposit-related fees and credit card sales. Also contributing to the increase was the absence of a prior-year net loss in Auto Finance associated with the transfer of $1.5 billion of lo ans to held-for-sale, higher automobile operating lease revenue and the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services in the first quart er of 2006. These increases were largely offset by lower net mortgage servicing revenue and by the sale of the insurance business. The provision for credit losses of $114 million was down by $264 million fr om the prior year, which included a $250 million special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina. Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion was down slightl y, benefiting from the sale of the insurance business during the quarter and merger-related an d other operating efficiencies. These decreases were offset partially by the acquisition of Colle giate Funding Services in the first quarter of 2006, investments in the retail distribution netw ork and higher depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Regional Banking net income of $744 million was up by $181 million from the prior year. Excluding the prior-year impact of a $143 million (after-tax) special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrin a, net income would have been up by $38 million, or 5%. Results also reflected the sale of the insurance business during the current quarter. Net revenue of $3.0 bill ion was up by $84 million, or 3%, benefiting from growth in deposits and home equity loans, increases in deposit-related fees and credit card sales, and the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services in the first quarter of 2006. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business, narrower spreads on loans and narrower sp reads on deposits caused by a shift in the deposit mix. The provision for credit losses decreased by $244 million, primarily the result of a $230 million special provision in the prior year related to Hurricane Katrina. Expenses of $1.6 billion were down by $62 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to the sale of the insurance business, merger savings and operating efficiencies, primarily offset by investments in the retail distribution network and the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services. Highlights Include:  Checking accounts of 9.3 million were up by 198,000, or 2%, during the quarter, and up by 568,000, or 7%, from the prior year.  Average total deposits incr eased to $187.4 billion, up 7% from the prior year and flat from the prior quarter. E nd-of-period total deposits were $188.2 billion, up 7% from the prior year and flat from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of credit cards increas ed by 66% from the prior year and decreased 24% from a strong prior-quarter level.  Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles) decreased to 51% from 54% in the prior year and was down from 53% in the prior quarter.  Number of branches increased to 2, 677, up by 128 from the prior year and up by 17 from the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5  Average home equity loans of $78.8 bill ion were up by $7.1 billion from the prior year; period-end home equity loans were $80.4 billion.  Home equity loan originations of $ 13.3 billion were down 7% from the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter.  Net charge-off rate was 0.17%, down from 0.22% in the prior year.  Completed the acquisition of The Bank of New York’s consumer and small- business franchises on October 1, 2006, adding $11.7 billion in deposits, $5.4 billion in loans, 339 branches and more than 400 ATMs. Mortgage Banking net loss was $83 million compar ed with net income of $53 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $198 million, down by $194 million. Revenue comprises production revenue an d net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue was $197 million, dow n by $32 million, reflecting a 28% decrease in mortgage originations, partiall y offset by wider margins. Net mortgage servicing revenue, which includes loan se rvicing revenue, MS R risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $1 million compared with $163 million in the prior year. Loan servicing revenue of $579 million increased by $46 million on a 13% increase in third-party loans servic ed. MSR risk management revenue of negative $251 million was down by $204 milli on from the prior year, reflecting a $235 million negative valuation adjustment to the MSR asset due to changes and refinements to inputs and assumptions us ed in the MSR valuat ion model.

Auto Finance net income of $85 million was up by $45 million from the prior year. Net revenue of $395 million was up by $75 m illion, or 23%, reflecting the absence of a prior-year write-down of $48 million associated with the transfer of $1.5 billion of loans to held-for-sale, higher automobile operating lease revenue and wider loan spreads on lower loan and direct finance lease balances. The provision for credit losses of $61 million decreased by $20 million du e to a special provision in the prior year related to Hurricane Katrina. Noni nterest expense of $194 million increased by $20 million, or 11%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Highlights Include:  Average loan receivables were $38.9 billion, down by $4.8 billion, or 11%, from the prior year and down by $1.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter.  Average lease-related assets of $3.9 b illion declined by $2.3 billion, or 37%, from the prior year.  The net charge-off rate was 0.64% compared with 0.56% in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 CARD SERVICES (CS) Results for CS(a) 2Q06 3Q05 ($ millions) 3Q06 2Q06 3Q05 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net Revenue $3,646 $3,664 $3,980 ($18) --% ($334) (8)% Provision for Credit Losses(b) 1,270 1,031 1,833 239 23 (563) (31) Noninterest Expense 1,253 1,249 1,286 4 -- (33) (3) Net Income $711 $875 $541 ($164) (19)% $170 31% (a) As a result of the integration of Chase Merchant Services and Paymentech merchant processi ng businesses into a joint ventur e, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, net revenue, noni nterest expense and pre-tax income have b een reduced to reflect the deconsolidatio n of Paymentech (no periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 have been adjusted to reflect the d econsolidation). The deconsolida tion of Paymentech has no impact on net income. (b) Third quarter of 2005 included a $10 0 million special provision for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina, of which $ 90 million was released in the second quarter of 2006. Discussion of Results: Net income of $711 million was up by $170 million, or 31%, from the prior year. Results were driven by a lower provision for credit losses due to significantly lower bankruptcy filings and the absence of an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $124 million (after-tax) in the prior year. To illustrate underlying business tr ends, the following discussion of Card Services’ performance assumes for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 that the deconso lidation of Paymentech had occurred as of the first quarter of 2005. Th e effect of the deconsolidation would have reduced net managed revenue, primarily noninter est revenue, and noninterest expense, but would not have had any impact on net income fo r such periods. See page 16 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (t hird-quarter 2006) for a reconciliation of Card Services results for the deconsolidation of Paymentech. End-of-period managed loans of $143.8 billion incr eased by $6.3 billion, or 5%, from the prior year and by $4.5 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans of $141.7 billion increased by $3.9 billion, or 3%, from the prior year and by $4.5 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. The current quarter included average and end-of-period managed loans of $2.1 billion from the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business (acquired in the fourth quarter of 2005), as well as $1.6 billion of average mana ged loans and $1.7 billion of end-of-period managed loans from the acquisition of the Kohl’s private label portfolio (acquired in the second quarter of 2006). Compared with the prior year, both average managed and end-of-period managed loans continued to be affected nega tively by higher customer payment rates. Management believes that contributing to the higher payment rates are the new minimum payment rules and a higher proportion of customers in rewards-based programs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Net managed revenue was $3.6 billion, down by $183 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was down by $80 m illion, or 3%. The decrease in net interest income was driven by attrition of mature, higher spread balances as a result of higher payment rates. Also contributing to the reduction was higher cost of funds on balance growth in promotional, introductory and tr ansactor loan bala nces, which increased due to continued investment in marketing. These decreases were offset partially by an increase in average managed loan balances due to acquisitions. Compared with the prior quarter, net interest income was down by $78 million, or 3%, due to an increase in revenue reversals related to increased net charge-offs and higher cost of funds on bala nce growth in introdu ctory, promotional and transactor loan balances. These decreases were offset partially by an increase in average managed loan balances. Noninterest reve nue of $762 million was down by $103 million, or 12%, due to higher volume-driven payments to partners, including Kohl’s, and increased rewards expense, partially offset by increased interchange income related to a 15% increase in charge volume. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 3 billion, down by $563 million, or 31%, from the prior year. This benefit was due to a decr ease in net charge-offs of $353 million, reflecting the continued low level of bankruptcy losses, partially offset by increased contractual net charge- offs. The provision also benefited from the lack of an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $200 million related to Hurricane Katrina and higher bankruptcy fi lings in the prior year. Compared with the prior quarter, the manage d provision for credit lo sses increased by $239 million, or 23%, primarily due to higher bankruptcy-related net charge-offs and the absence of a $90 million release of allowance for credit losses related to Hurricane Katrina. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.58%, down from 4.70% in the prior year, but up from 3.28% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed de linquency rate was 3.17%, down from 3.39% in the prior year, but up slightly from 3.14% in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense of $1.3 billion was up by $101 million, or 9%, from the prior year due to the acquisitions of the Sears Canada credit card business and Kohl’s private label portfolio as well as higher marketing spending, partially offset by merger savings. Highlights Include:  Pre-tax income to average managed loans (ROO) was 3.14%, up from 2.48% in the prior year, but down from 4.05% in the prior quarter.  Net interest income as a percentage of average managed loans was 8.07%, down from 8.55% in the prior year and 8.66% in the prior quarter.  Net accounts opened during the quarter were 4.2 million.  Charge volume of $87.5 billion increas ed by $11.1 billion, or 15%, from the prior year.  Merchant processing volume of $168.7 bi llion increased by $25.3 billion, or 18%, and total transactions of 4.6 b illion increased by 676 million, or 17%, from the prior year.  Agreement announced to acquire the Pier 1 Imports private label portfolio with $140 million of receivables.

These Corporate Trust businesses, which were previously reported in Treas ury & Securities Services, have been deemed discontinu ed operations. The related balance sheet and income statement activity have been transferred to the Corporate segment for all periods presented. Discussion of Results:(see note (a) above) Net income was $256 million, up by $34 million, or 15%, from the prior year. Earnings benefited from higher revenue due to wider spreads on higher average liability balances and growth in client volumes.

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, up by $119 million, or 9%, from the prio r year. Noninterest revenue was $980 million, up by $69 million, or 8%. The improvement was due largely to an increase in assets under custody to $12.9 trillion, which was driven by market value appreciation and new business. Also contributing to the im provement was growth in ADRs, global clearing and securities lending, all of which were driven by a combination of increased product usage by existing clients and new business. Net inte rest income was $519 million, up by $50 million, or 11%, due to wider spreads on a 22% increase in average liability balances.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $346 million, up by $31 million, or 10%, from the prior year. Performance was driven by increased revenue offset primarily by higher compensation expense. Net revenue was $1.6 billion, up by $187 million, or 13%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue, principally fees and commissions, of $1.4 billion was up by $223 million, or 19%. This increase was due largely to increased assets under management and higher performance fees. Net interest income was $231 million, down by $36 million, or 13%, from the prior year, primarily due to narrower deposit spreads, reflecting a shift in the deposit mix, and the sale of BrownCo in the fourth quarter of 2005, partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances. Private Bank client segment revenue grew 11% from the prior year, to $469 million, due to increased placement activity, higher asset mana gement fees and higher deposit balances, partially offset by narrower deposit spreads. Institutional client segment revenue grew 30%, to $464 million, due to net asset inflows and higher performance fees. Retail client segment revenue grew 10%, to $456 million, primarily due to net asset inflows, partially offset by the sale of BrownCo. Private Client Services client segment revenue decreased 3%, to $247 million, due to narrower deposit and loan spreads, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Assets under supervision were $1.3 trillion, up 10%, or $112 billion, from the prior year, net of a $33 billion reduction due to the sa le of BrownCo. Assets under management were $935 billion, up 13%, or $107 billion, from the prior year. The in crease was the result of net asset inflows in the retail segment from third-party distribution, primarily in equity-related products, institutional flows in liquidity products and market ap preciation. Custody, brokera ge, administration and deposit balances were $330 bil lion, up by $5 billion, net of a $33 billion reduction from the sale of BrownCo. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $28 million compared with a benefit of $19 million in the prior year. The increased benefit reflects a higher level of recoveries. Noninterest expense of $1.1 bil lion was up by $139 million, or 14%, from the prior year. The increase was due to higher compensation, includ ing incremental expense related to SFAS 123R, as well as minority interest related to Highbri dge Capital Management, partially offset by the sale of BrownCo.

In comparison with the prior year, Private Equity earnings were $95 million, down from $141 million; Treasury net income was $70 million comp ared with a net loss of $301 million; Other Corporate net loss was $199 million compared with a net loss of $457 million; and earnings from Discontinued Operations were $65 million compared with $58 million. Net revenue was $287 million compared with ne gative $393 million in the prior year. Net interest income was negative $55 million compared with negative $650 million in the prior year. Treasury was the primary driver of the improve ment, with net interest income of $149 million compared with negative $415 million, primarily be nefiting from an improvement in Treasury’s net interest spread and an increase in available-for-sale securities. Noninterest revenue was $342 million compared with $257 million, reflecting $24 million of security gains in Treasury compared with security losses of $43 million. These benefits were offset partially by lower Private Equity gains of $226 million compared with gains of $313 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 Noninterest expense was $479 million, down by $128 million from $607 million in the prior year, and up by $324 million from the prior quarter.

(b) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (Page 14) for further explanation of managed basis. (c) Third quarter of 2005 provision for cr edit losses included $400 million related to Hurricane Katrina, of which $90 million was released in the second quarter of 2006. Discussion of Results:(see notes (a) (b) above) Net income was $3.3 billion, up by $770 million compar ed with $2.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven primarily by higher revenue and lower managed provision for credit losses. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Net managed revenue was $16.2 billion, up by $875 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.5 billion was up by $561 million, or 6%, reflecting the following: record investment banking fees, increased asse t management, administ ration, and commissions revenue, and higher other income. Offsetting this growth was lower credit card income, decreased principal transactions and lower Mortgage Banking results. Net interest income was $6.8 billion, up by $314 million, or 5%, due to an improvement in the Corporate segment’s net interest spread, and increases in : consumer loans, wholesale deposits, and consumer deposits. This increase was offset partially by narrower spreads on: trading-related assets, consumer loans, and consumer deposits, as well as a shift in the deposit mix. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 4 billion, down by $693 million, or 33%, from the prior year, partially due to the absence of a special provision of $400 million related to Hurricane Katrina and lower bankruptcy-related losses in Card Services. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $35 million for the quarter compared with a benefit of $99 million in the prior year. The $35 million provision reflect s loan growth and stable credit quality. The wholesale loan net recovery rate was 0.03% for the quarter comp ared with a net recovery rate of 0.12% in the prior year. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, $827 million lower than the prior year, prim arily due to the absence of special provisions for Hurricane Katrina and lower bankruptcy-related losses in Card Services. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.3 billion at September 30, 2006, down by $539 million, or 19%, from the prior-year level of $2.8 billion. Noninterest expense was $9.7 billion, up by $292 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Excluding in the current quarter incremental expense of $104 million related to SFAS 123R, $48 million of merger costs, and $17 million of insurance recoveri es relating to certain material litigation, and excluding in the prior year $221 m illion of merger costs, nonint erest expense would have been up by $378 million. The increase was driven by higher compensation expense and acquisitions, partially offset by the deconsolidation of Paymentech, and the sale of the insurance underwriting business. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.6% at September 30, 2006 (estimated), 8.5% at June 30, 2006, and 8.2% at September 30, 2005.  During the quarter, $900 million of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 20 million shares purchased at an average price of $44.88 per share. Year-to-date, $2.9 billion of common st ock was repurchased, reflecting 70 million shares purchased at an averag e price of $42.22 per share. As of September 30, 2006, $6.2 billion of capac ity remained unde r the $8 billion share purchase program approved on March 21, 2006.  Headcount of 171,589 decreased by 834 since June 30, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 Merger and other financial information • Merger savings and cost: For the quarter ended September 30, 2006, approximately $655 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualized rate of $2.6 billion. Management estimates that annualized savings will be approximately $2.8 billion by the end of 2006. Management continues to estimate that annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion will be achieved. Merger costs of $48 million were expensed during the third quarter of 2006, bringing the total amount incurred to $3.3 billion (including capitalized costs) since the merger announcement. Management currently expects total merger costs will be approximately $4.0 billion. The remaining merger costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2007. • FASB Statement No. 123R (“Share-Based Payment”): JPMorgan Chase adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), (“Share-Based Payment”) as of January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires that stock compensation granted to retirement-eligible employees be fully expensed at, or prior to, the time of grant rather than amortized over the vesting period. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarte r of 2006, the firm expensed the full amount of the compensation expense associated with grants of restrict ed stock made in January 2006 to retirement-eligible employees. In addition, during the firs t quarter of 2006, the firm began to accrue the estimated cost of grants expected to be awarded in January 2007 to retirement-eligible employees. The total incremental expense recorded in the first quarter and second quarter of 2006 was $459 million and $106 million. During the third quarter of 2006 incremental expense of $104 million was recorded. Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees prior to January 1, 2006, have not been acceler ated and will continue to be amortized over the original vesting periods. The firm estimates that the incremental expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R for the fourth quarter of 2006 will be approximately $110 million. The incrementa l expenses incurred during 2006 are non-cash charges and represent accelerated recognition of costs that would have been incurred in future periods. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a report ed basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines’ of business results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and over all financial performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the cred it card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will aff ect both the loan receiva bles sold under SFAS 14 0 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed loan receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is pr esented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are pres ented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology a llows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The co rresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third quarter of 2006) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pre-tax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre-tax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates the performance of TSS and AWM against that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
