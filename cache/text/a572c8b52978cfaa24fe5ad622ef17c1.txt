Lending strength continued with average firmwide loans up 5% while credit losses are still at historically low levels. We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term – consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels – but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.” Dimon continued: “In Consumer & Community Banking, deposits were up 18% and client investment assets were up 9%, largely driven by positive net flows. Combined debit and credit card spend was up 21% as we continue to see a pick-up in credit card spending on travel and dining. Card loan balances were up 11% but remain below pre- pandemic levels. Auto loans were up 3% but the lack of vehicle supply continues to affect originations which were down 25%. In Home Lending, originations of $25 billion were down 37%, primarily due to the rising rate environment. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, we maintained our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking although fees were down 31% due to lower equity and debt underwriting activity. Markets revenue was down 3% compared to a record first quarter last year. Commercial Banking loans were up 2% and we are seeing a pick-up in both new loan demand as well as revolver utilization. Asset & Wealth Management delivered strong results as we saw positive inflows into long-term products of $19 billion across all channels, as well as continued strong loan growth, up 14%, primarily driven by securities-based lending.” Dimon added: “Our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to persevere in our steadfast dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world even in difficult times. In the quarter, we extended credit and raised capital of $640 billion for large and small businesses, governments and U.S. consumers. Our longstanding capital hierarchy remains the same - first and foremost, to invest in and grow our market-leading businesses; second, to pay a sustainable competitive dividend; and then, to return any remaining excess capital to shareholders through stock buybacks.” Dimon concluded: “Our focus this quarter remained on helping our clients navigate difficult markets and unpredictable events, which included working with governments to implement economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity. While our company will continue to deal with this global turmoil, our hearts go out to the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and to all of those affected by the war.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 1Q22 results included: n $902 million net credit reserve build Firmwide ($0.23 decrease in earnings per share (EPS)) n $524 million of losses within Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties ($0.13 decrease in EPS) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.0 billion, or $1.00 per share n $1.7 billion of common stock net repurchases in 1Q22 5 n The Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized a new common equity share repurchase program of $30 billion, effective May 1, 20225 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $86.16, up 5%; tangible book value per share 2 of $69.58, up 5% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 3 of $208 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 11.9%; Advanced ratio3 of 12.6% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.2% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 1Q22 expense of $19.2 billion; reported overhead ratio of 62%; managed overhead ratio2 of 61% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $640 billion of credit and capital9 raised in 1Q22 n $69 billion of credit for consumers n $8 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $265 billion of credit for corporations n $282 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $16 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the first quarter of 2022 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue was $31.6 billion, down 5%. Net interest income (NII) was $14.0 billion, up 7%. NII exclu ding Markets 2 was $11.8 billion, up 9%, predominantly driven by balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII associated with PPP loans. Noninterest revenue was $17.6 billion, down 12%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, losses on legacy equity investments compared to gains in the prior year and $394 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate, and lower net production revenue in Home Lending. The decrease also reflects a loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB related to funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from Russia-associated counterparties. Noninterest expense was $19.2 billion, up 2%, predominantly driven by investments and structural expense, largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense, including revenue-related compensation in CIB. The prior year expense included a $550 million contribution to the Firm’s Foundation. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, reflecting a net reserve build of $902 million driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as accounting for Russia-associated exposure in CIB and AWM, and $582 million of net charge-offs. The net reserve build in the current year was comprised of $776 million in Wholesale, including $426 million in CIB, and $127 million in Consumer. Net charge-offs of $582 million were down $475 million, driven by Card. The prior year provision was a net benefit of $4.2 billion, reflecting a net reserve release of $5.2 billion and $1.1 billion of net charge-offs. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Card & Auto net revenue was $5.0 billion, down 8% , on strong new Card account originations leading to higher acquisition costs and lower Auto operating lease income, partially offset by higher Card net interest income on higher revolving balances.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 86.16, $ 88.07 and $ 82.31 at March 31, 2022 , December 31, 2021 , and March 31, 2021 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2021 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
