About non-GAAP financial measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

Non-GAAP constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current quarter. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the increase in current quarter non-GAAP constant currency revenues over prior period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period. 8 Other income (expense), net The following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited): Quarter Ended June 30, 2021 2022 Interest income $ 389 $ 486 Interest expense (76) (83) Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net (51) (260) Gain (loss) on debt securities, net 111 (790) Gain (loss) on equity securities, net(1) 2,772 (251) Performance fees (523) 318 Income (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net 92 (118) Other (90) 259 Other income (expense), net $ 2,624 $ (439) (1) Includes all gai ns and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity investments. For Q2 2022, the net effect of the loss on equity securities of $251 million and the $318 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments decreased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $14 million, $53 million, and less than $0.01, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.
