JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 New York, October 11, 2013 - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net loss of $0.4 billion for the third quarter of 2013, compared with net income of $5.7 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Earnings per share were $(0.17), compared with $1.40 in the third quarter of 2012. Revenue1 for the quarter was $23.9 billion, compared with $25.9 billion in the prior year. The Firm's return on tangible common equity1 for the third quarter of 2013 was (2)%, compared with 16% in the prior year. Third-quarter results included legal expense in Corporate of $9.2 billion ($7.2 billion after-tax), and a benefit from reserve releases of $1.6 billion ($992 million after-tax). Excluding these items, third-quarter net income would have been $5.8 billion, or $1.42 per share1. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the Company’s results: “While we had strong underlying performance across the businesses, unfortunately, the quarter was marred by large legal expense. We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them. While we expect our litigation costs should abate and normalize over time, they may continue to be volatile over the next several quarters.” Dimon continued: “The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues – and one that recognizes the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the U.S. Government.” Commenting on the business performance, Dimon continued: “We maintained our #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking fees and our unparalleled capital raising and advisory capabilities led to ground-breaking transactions and market share gains. Equity Markets revenue was up 20%, driven by broad-based strength across products. In Consumer Banking and Credit Card, our customer satisfaction scores continue to rise and our customer attrition remains low. For the second consecutive year, we led the nation in deposit growth – up 10% from the prior year – more than twice the industry average. Credit card sales volume was a record $107.0 billion, up 11%, and general purpose credit card sales volume growth has outperformed the industry for 22 consecutive quarters. Asset Management continued to have strong performance, with $19 billion of net long-term client flows, the 18th consecutive quarter of positive net long-term client flows. We are seeing continued positive trends in consumer and stability in wholesale – loss rates in mortgage are improving steadily as delinquencies continue to decline, and credit card delinquencies are at 20-year lows across the industry.” Dimon concluded: “We continue our intense focus on our legal, control, and regulatory agenda – we are simplifying our business and making unprecedented investments in controls, which will make our company better and stronger for the long-run. We are extremely gratified that, in light of the issues the Company is facing, our people continue to do an unwavering and excellent job in serving their clients and communities, which you see in the underlying performance of our businesses.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Private Equity reported net income of $242 million, compared with a net loss of $89 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $398 million, compared with a loss of $135 million in the prior year, primarily due to net valuation gains on private investments. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was a loss of $232 million, compared with net revenue of $713 million in the prior year. The prior-year revenue reflected $888 million extinguishment gains related to the redemption of trust preferred securities.

See notes on page 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23,117 million, $25,211 million, and $25,146 million for the third quarter of 2013, second quarter of 2013, and third quarter of 2012, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was a loss of approximately $0.4 billion, down $6.1 billion from the prior year, due to higher noninterest expense and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $23.9 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 8%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $12.9 billion, down $1.8 billion, or 12%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter revenue included a $397 million loss from DVA on certain structured notes and derivative liabilities. Net interest income was $11.0 billion, down $220 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower loan yields due to competitive pressures and replacement of higher yielding loans with lower yielding loans, partially offset by higher investment securities yield and lower net interest expense on long-term debt. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $543 million, compared with a provision for credit losses of $1.8 billion in the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was a benefit of $273 million, compared with an expense of $1.9 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.6 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to favorable delinquency trends and lower estimated losses in the mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.47% and 3.10%, respectively. The prior- year total net charge-offs included $880 million of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $270 million, compared with a benefit of $63 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $26 million, compared with net recoveries of $34 million in the prior year, resulting in a net charge-off rate of 0.03% and a net recovery rate of 0.05%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.89%, compared with 2.61% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.2 billion, down from the prior-quarter and prior-year levels of $10.9 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up $8.3 billion, or 54%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher litigation reserves. The current quarter included approximately $9.3 billion of legal expense, JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 including reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings, compared with $790 million of expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Basel I Tier 1 common ratio1 was 10.5% Headcount was 255,041, a decrease of 4,103, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm presents net income and earnings per share excluding the aftertax impact of reductions in the allowance for loan losses and litigation expense in Corporate. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Firm’s reported results. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm's performance. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported results to these non-GAAP measures. Three months ended September 30, 2013 In millions Per-share amounts Reported: Net income $ (380) $ (0.17) Adjustments: Corporate litigation expense 7,200 1.85 Reduction in allowance for loan losses (992) (0.26) As adjusted: Net income $ 5,828 $ 1.42 b. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. c. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.0 billion at September 30, 2013, and $5.7 billion at each of June 30, 2013, and September 30, 2012. In Corporate & Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage. d. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represents the Firm’s common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firm's earnings as a percentage of average TCE. In management's view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as to analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. e. The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, along with other capital measures, are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In July 2013, U.S. federal banking agencies approved a final rule for implementing Basel III in the U. S. For further information on Basel I and Basel III, see Regulatory capital on pages 117-119 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and on pages 60-63 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. f. In Consumer & Community Banking, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented include loans held-for-sale. g. Corporate & Investment Bank provides several measures which exclude the impact of debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) on: net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Consumer & Community Banking deposit rankings are based on the FDIC 2013 Summary of Deposits survey per SNL Financial. Accounts include checking accounts and Chase LiquidSM cards. c. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense of Mortgage Production. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the second quarter of 2013. e. In Commercial Banking, effective January 1, 2013, whole loan financing agreements, previously reported as other assets, were reclassified as loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, the impact on period-end loans was $1.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and the impact on average loans was $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. f. Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of Asset Management against the performance of its respective peers. g. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.
