However, for Tesla&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in light of our past accomplishments &#8212; 2023 could also be called just a typical year of triumphs and achievements. In 2023, the Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in the world, we launched our new Model 3 lineup, saw tremendous strides in our quest for FSD and we began deliveries of our innovative and highly anticipated Cybertruck. We also witnessed the beginning of the significant growth of our Energy Storage and Services and Other businesses. We believe these types of triumphs and achievements are normal course for Tesla because Tesla is a nimble organization with an unmatched pace of innovation that has resulted in products and services that surpass all expectations driven by visionary leadership and most importantly the best and most dedicated employees in the world. We want to thank all of our employees for their outstanding efforts. Of course, a key part of this nimble organization requires careful management of our resources. We recently announced a company-wide restructuring that reduces our headcount by more than 10% globally. Over the&#160;years, we have grown rapidly with multiple factories scaling around the globe. With this rapid growth, there has been a duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas. We believe it is extremely important to look at every aspect of our business for cost reductions and increasing productivity. This action will prepare us for our next phase of growth, as we are developing some of the most revolutionary technologies in auto, energy and artificial intelligence. With Your Vote in the 2024 Annual Meeting, Tesla Will Thrive. Our stockholders drive Tesla. Your votes and your voices make critical decisions for the future of our company, and we have and want to continue to listen to you. That is why we are asking for your support for all of our management proposals including re-election of two of our hardworking and dedicated directors, Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch. However, there are two important proposals that I want to touch on here, that we believe are critical to the future success of Tesla, both of which were recommended following a rigorous and thoughtful analysis by an independent Special Committee, comprised of another one of our hardworking and dedicated directors in Kathleen Wilson-Thompson: 1. Approving moving Tesla&#8217;s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas (Proposal Three); and &#8203; 2. Ratifying Elon Musk&#8217;s compensation under the CEO pay package that our stockholders previously approved at our 2018 special meeting (Proposal Four). &#8203; Texas Is Tesla&#8217;s Home. 2024 is the year that Tesla should move home to Texas. We are asking for your vote to approve Tesla&#8217;s move from Delaware, our current state of incorporation, to a new legal home in Texas. Texas is already our business home, and we are committed to it. Gigafactory Texas is one of the largest factories in the United &#8203; &#8199; &#160; TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; States, covering 2,500 acres along the Colorado River. The Gigafactory is the manufacturing hub for our most innovative vehicles, including the Cybertruck and the Model Y. We have a significant number of manufacturing, operations, and engineering employees in Texas, and our executives are based there. Texas is where we should continue working towards our mission of accelerating the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy, as we lay the foundation for our growth with our ramp and build of factories for our future vehicles and to help meet the demand for energy storage as well as with our progress in artificial intelligence via full self-driving and Optimus. We have received letters from thousands of Tesla stockholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;large and small&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;supporting a move home to Texas. We have heard you, and now we formally ask that you speak in a meaningful way: and vote in favor of taking Tesla to our business home of Texas. Ratification Will Restore Tesla&#8217;s Stockholder Democracy. Corporate democracy and stockholder rights are at the heart of Tesla&#8217;s values. Earlier this year, a Delaware Court ruling in Tornetta&#160;v. Musk (which can be found as Annex I to this Proxy Statement) struck down one of your votes and rescinded the pay package that an overwhelming majority of you voted to grant to our CEO, Elon Musk, in 2018. The Tornetta Court decided, years later, that the CEO pay package was not &#8220;entirely fair&#8221; to the very same stockholders who voted to approve it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;even though approximately 73% of all votes cast by our disinterested stockholders voted to approve it in 2018. Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six&#160;years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it. The 2018 CEO pay package required Elon to deliver transformative and unprecedented growth to earn any compensation. It was a big risk, and many thought that the plan&#8217;s targets for benefits to stockholders were simply unachievable. But our company and our leaders have always had big dreams and it is fundamental to the entrepreneurial spirit of Tesla to take big risks for the chance at big rewards. This has led to the incredible innovation and progress&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and economic gains&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that we have achieved at Tesla. In 2018, we asked for unbelievable growth and accomplishments. Elon delivered: Tesla&#8217;s stockholders have benefited from unprecedented growth under Elon&#8217;s leadership and Tesla has met every single one of the 2018 CEO pay package&#8217;s targets. And&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;most importantly for the future of Tesla&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the 2018 CEO pay package built in further incentives to benefit Tesla stockholders by requiring that Elon hold onto any shares he receives when he exercises his options for five&#160;years&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which means he will continue to be driven to innovate and drive growth at Tesla because the value of his shares will depend on it! &#8203; &#160; TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; The Board stands behind this pay package. We believed in it in 2018, as we asked Elon to pursue remarkable goals to grow the company. You, as stockholders, also believed in it in 2018 when you overwhelmingly approved it. Time and results have only shown the wisdom of our judgment. We do not agree with what the Delaware Court decided, and we do not think that what the Delaware Court said is how corporate law should or does work. So we are coming to you now so you can help fix this issue&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is a matter of fundamental fairness and respect to our CEO. You have the chance to reinstate your vote and make it count. We are asking you to make your voice heard&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;once again&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by voting to approve ratification of Elon&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan. Thank you for your continued support of Tesla, and, together with my fellow Board members, I hope you can join us for our 2024 annual meeting on June 13, 2024 at 3:30 p.m. Central Time.

Proposal Four Notice: &#160;&#160;&#160;For purposes of Section 204 of the DGCL (as defined below), at a meeting on April 16, 2024, the Board determined that the 2018 CEO Performance Award (as defined below) may be deemed to be a &#8220;defective corporate act&#8221; as defined in Section 204 of the DGCL to be ratified. The date of such &#8220;defective corporate act&#8221; is March 21, 2018. The Board concluded that the nature of the &#8220;failure of authorization&#8221; as defined in Section 204 of the DGCL in respect of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was the failure of the 2018 CEO Performance Award to have obtained the necessary stockholder approval due to certain defects in the disclosures in the Company's proxy statement for the 2018 Special Meeting. The Board has approved the ratification of the defective corporate act. Pursuant to Section 204 of the DGCL, any claim that the defective corporate act ratified hereunder is void or voidable due to the failure of authorization, or that the Delaware Court of Chancery should declare in its discretion that a ratification in accordance with this section not be effective or be effective only on certain conditions must be brought within 120 days from the applicable validation effective time. The information contained in this section of the notice is being provided solely for purposes of any ratification pursuant to Section 204 of the DGCL and not for any other purpose. &#8203; &#8203; Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the 2024 Annual Meeting, we encourage you to read the proxy statement and vote as soon as possible.

In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220; SEC &#8221;) rules, we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet to our stockholders rather than in paper form, which reduces the environmental impact of our annual meeting and our costs.

Stockholders of record may access the proxy materials on the website listed above or request a printed set of the proxy materials be sent to them by following the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability.

If you choose the e-mail option, you will receive an e-mail next year with links to those materials and to the proxy voting site. We encourage you to choose this e-mail option, which will allow us to provide you with the information you need in a timelier manner, save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and conserve natural resources. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail or in printed form by mail will remain in effect until you terminate it. If you are a beneficial owner, you will not receive a Notice of Internet Availability directly from us, but your broker, bank or other intermediary will forward you a notice with instructions on accessing our proxy materials and directing that organization how to vote your shares, as well as other options that may be available to you for receiving our proxy materials.

Our corporate governance structure has facilitated several key decisions which have set Tesla up to achieve long-term success and our mission to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. &#8203; &#8203; Some examples include our decisions to: &#8226; Manufacture all-electric vehicles from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier of EV components; &#8203; &#8226; Establish an international network of our stores, service centers and Supercharger stations despite regulatory hurdles and the significant capital outlay required to do so; &#8203; &#8226; Build Gigafactory Nevada, the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world, so that we can scale most effectively; &#8203; &#8226; Expand into energy generation and storage through the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (&#8220; SolarCity &#8221;) in 2016 to create a vertically integrated sustainable energy company and empower individual consumers to be their own utility; &#8203; &#8226; Deploy FSD (Supervised) incrementally, resulting in over one billion cumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised) to date; and &#8203; &#8226; Compensate our CEO only if other stockholders realize tremendous value. &#8203; These and other similar decisions were made due to our corporate governance structure and, ultimately, decisions like these are what differentiate Tesla from other companies. Year-Round Engagement Our Board of Directors (the &#8220; Board &#8221;) continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and weighs stakeholder feedback. It is important to our Board that the Company speaks with our stockholders and is responsive to engagement and believes that stockholder and stakeholder perspectives are important to our Company&#8217;s success. The Board maintains an active, year-round dialogue with our largest stockholders to ensure that Tesla&#8217;s Board and management understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders. This includes focused one-on-one meetings between our Board and stockholders throughout the year that are designed to give institutional stockholders an opportunity to better understand our strategy and governance and raise any concerns, and allow our directors to become better informed about our stockholders&#8217; views and concerns. We pursue multiple avenues for stockholder engagement, including video and teleconference meetings with our stockholders, participating at various conferences, engaging with proxy and other advisory firms, issuing periodic reports on our activities, and receiving feedback from our retail holders. Board Responsiveness Through the Board&#8217;s engagement program discussed above, we have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters. Moreover, members of the Board and management from time to time seek input from our investors when considering important corporate actions, including our consideration of, and responses to, stockholder proposals that involve corporate governance and alignment with stockholder interests. As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including, but not limited to: &#8226; Progressively adding directors who are independent under the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220; Nasdaq &#8221;) and bring additional viewpoints and key skills in different areas as &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; we evolve, including Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in 2018, Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020, Joe Gebbia in 2022 and JB Straubel in 2023; &#8226; Following the passing proposal at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2022 (the &#8220; 2022 Annual Meeting &#8221;) relating to proxy access, meeting with key stockholders to discuss their views and formulate a framework to address the proposal, after which the Board voted to amend the bylaws of the Company to enable proxy access, in such a manner as to reflect such stockholder views; &#8203; &#8226; Hosting Investor Day in March&#160;2023, in which Tesla leaders presented on key areas important to our success, affording stockholders more detailed assessments of the performance, achievements, growth opportunities and areas of focus for our businesses, and addressing stockholder feedback requesting greater visibility into our business leaders and roadmap; &#8203; &#8226; Amending our pledging policy to (i)&#160;cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5&#160;billion or twenty-five&#160;percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, and (ii)&#160;lower the&#160;percentage used to calculate the maximum loan or investment amount borrowable by directors and officers (other than our CEO) based on the total value of such director or officer&#8217;s pledged stock from 25% to 15%; &#8203; &#8226; Enhancing our proxy statement disclosures, including with respect to our corporate governance approach, succession planning, risk oversight, Committee engagement and director skills; &#8203; &#8226; Publishing an annual Impact Report, and providing disclosures including those aligned with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board recommendations, as well as EEO-1 data; and &#8203; &#8226; Recommending management proposals in prior&#160;years, including at the 2022 Annual Meeting, to reduce director terms and eliminate applicable supermajority voting requirements. &#8203; This year, we will be publishing our sixth annual Impact Report with enhanced disclosures across people, environment, product and supply chain. In response to stockholder engagement, in 2023 we began expanding Scope 3 emissions disclosures and continued our alignment with the TCFD&#8217;s recommended climate related disclosures. We will expand our environmental disclosures, as well as disclosures on the culture we continue to build and enhance at Tesla, how we engage and aim to retain our employees, progress we are making on displacing fossil fuels, the efficiency and safety of our products and how we manage risks in the supply chain, among many other topics. For further information, please navigate to the &#8220;Impact&#8221; page of the Investor Relations section on our website. We intend to publish our 2023 Report by the end of May&#160;2024. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website and in our Impact Report, or any other website, is not incorporated in, and is not part of, this proxy statement or any other report or filing we make with the SEC. Our Board&#8217;s Commitment to Governance Our Board believes in maintaining stockholder confidence through, among other things, demonstrating its responsiveness to stockholder feedback and its commitment to corporate governance. Accordingly, to provide an enhanced voice to our stockholders in approving fundamental corporate matters, the Board is committed to enabling the elimination of certain supermajority voting requirements in our charter and bylaws through the process outlined below. In recent years, our Board repeatedly proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to reduce director terms and/or to eliminate certain supermajority voting. However, such amendments failed to pass each time that the Board proposed them. Because the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 &#8725; 3 % of the total outstanding shares entitled to vote is required to approve such amendments, similar proposals cannot pass unless we achieve such a stockholder participation rate. In response to not reaching the required stockholder participation rate, beginning in 2022, we took active steps in an effort to further increase the participation rate of our retail investors through the development of our Shareholder Platform (discussed below), outreach campaigns, direct mailings, one-on-one engagements and through social media channels. This resulted in achieving, in 2022, our highest stockholder participation rate in the last five&#160;years of over 63%, though still short of the required 66 2 &#8725; 3 % participation rate. &#160; 4 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; We will continue to marshal our resources and continue our efforts to further increase retail investor participation rates as rapidly as possible, including through an active communications campaign via our Shareholder Platform and social media channels encouraging retail stockholders to vote their shares. Once we have achieved a total stockholder participation rate of at least 65% at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again propose charter and bylaw amendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. To the extent that this proposal to eliminate supermajority voting requirements achieves the required threshold to pass, this will unlock a gateway for our Board and stockholders to adopt further stockholder-driven governance actions, including, without limitation, the right for stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting, and the declassification of the Board, as may be appropriate in accordance with law. Furthermore, as previously discussed, the Board is consistently listening and receptive to taking further governance actions when appropriate. Shareholder Platform In 2022, building on our efforts to enhance engagement among our retail stockholder base, Tesla launched our Shareholder Platform. Any Tesla stockholder, regardless of holdings size, can sign up to stay informed about investor-related topics such as quarterly filings and event announcements, and are eligible for selection to participate in in-person Tesla events such as the Tesla Semi launch event, AI Day 2, Investor Day and the Cybertruck delivery event. Tesla has one of the largest retail stockholder bases of any public company. Our retail stockholders are incredibly engaged and tend to have a very strong understanding of the Company, and are an important base of support and feedback for management and the Board. We will continue to build the system to maximize depth of engagement and reach. Our goal is for every retail stockholder who wants to engage with the Company to have a meaningful framework for interaction through the Shareholder Platform. Hybrid Annual Stockholder Meetings Beginning in 2020, we have conducted our annual meetings both in-person and online through a live webcast and online stockholder tools. Our online format opens up engagement to all stockholders, regardless of the amount of stock owned and geography, and allows our substantial retail stockholder population to hear directly from our Board and management, as well as to submit questions online. At the same time, due to investor feedback and interest, we continue to also host our meetings in-person so stockholders have the opportunity to engage with our Board and management in-person. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Management Proposals Proposal One Tesla Proposal for Election of Directors General Tesla&#8217;s Board currently consists of eight members who are divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Our bylaws permit the Board to establish by resolution the authorized number of directors, and eight directors are currently authorized. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of an equal number of directors. The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to frequently evaluate the optimal size and composition of the Board to allow it to operate nimbly and efficiently, while maintaining new ideas, expertise and experience among its membership. Nominees for Class&#160;II Directors Two candidates have been nominated for election as Class&#160;II directors at the 2024 Annual Meeting for a three-year term expiring in 2027. Upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has nominated James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk for election as Class&#160;II directors. Biographical information about each of the nominees is contained in the following section. A discussion of the qualifications, attributes and skills of each nominee that led the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the conclusion that he should be elected or continue to serve as a director follows each of the director and nominee biographies. If you are a stockholder of record and you sign your proxy card or vote by telephone or over the Internet but do not&#160;give instructions with respect to the voting of directors, your shares will be voted &#8220; FOR &#8221; the election of Messrs.&#160;Murdoch and Musk. Each of Messrs. Murdoch and Musk has accepted such nomination; however, in the event that a nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the 2024 Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who shall be designated by the Board to fill such vacancy. If you wish to give specific instructions with respect to the voting of directors, you may do so by indicating your instructions on your proxy card or when you vote by telephone or over the Internet. If you are a beneficial owner holding your shares in street name and you do not give voting instructions to your broker, bank or other intermediary, that organization will leave your shares unvoted on this matter. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote FOR the Tesla proposal for the election of Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 6 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Information Regarding the Board and Director Nominees The names of the members of the Board and Tesla&#8217;s director nominees, their respective ages, their positions with Tesla and other biographical information as of April 29, 2024, are set forth below.

On April&#160;26, 2019, this settlement was amended to clarify certain of its terms, which was subsequently approved by the Court. Mr.&#160;Musk did not admit or deny any of the SEC&#8217;s allegations, and there is no restriction on Mr. Musk&#8217;s ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board. See &#8220; Corporate Governance &#8221; and &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Compensation of Directors &#8221; below for additional information regarding the Board. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Two Tesla Proposal for Non-Binding Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation General Pursuant to Schedule&#160;14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our &#8220;named executive officers&#8221; as disclosed in accordance with the SEC&#8217;s rules in the &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8221; section of this proxy statement beginning on page 123 below. This proposal, commonly known as a &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221; proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to weigh in on our named executive officers&#8217; compensation as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive officer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. The say-on-pay vote will, however, provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the Compensation Committee will be able to consider when determining executive compensation for the remainder of the current fiscal year and beyond. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders&#8217; concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. Summary of the 2023 Executive Compensation Program The following is a summary of some of the key points of our 2023 executive compensation program: &#8226; Tesla continues to emphasize structuring compensation incentives to reward our named executive officers based on performance. &#8203; &#8226; Equity awards weigh heavily in our named executive officers&#8217; total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive officers&#8217; incentives are closely aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Since 2020, the last year any of our named executive officers received equity awards, except for Xiaotong (Tom) Zhu, our Senior Vice President, Automotive, who received stock option awards upon his promotion to such role, all awards that were granted to our named executive officers have been in the form of stock options. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers&#8217; total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance. &#8203; &#8226; Tesla has no cash bonus program for any of our named executive officers and generally does not provide any perquisites or tax reimbursements to our named executive officers that are not available to other employees. No named executive officer currently has any severance or change of control arrangement. &#8203; &#8226; Each named executive officer is employed at will and is expected to demonstrate exceptional personal performance in order to continue serving as a member of the executive team. &#8203; &#8226; Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May&#160;2019 at Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently, 100% of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s future compensation was at-risk in the form of the remaining unvested stock options under the 10-year performance-based stock option award granted to Mr. Musk in January&#160;2018 (the &#8220; 2018 CEO Performance Award &#8221;). &#8203; &#160; 16 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8226; In particular, the 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 equal tranches, each of which vested upon the achievement of a market capitalization milestone matched to one of eight revenue-based operational milestones or eight Adjusted EBITDA-based operational milestones, all of which were viewed as difficult hurdles at the time of grant. While our stockholders benefit from each incremental increase in Tesla&#8217;s performance and stock price, aligning their interests with Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s incentives, the tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested only upon the full achievement of specific milestones, making it even more challenging for Mr.&#160;Musk to realize value from such increases. As of the date of this proxy statement, all of the tranches have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the three-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August&#160;2022 (the &#8220; 2022 Stock Split &#8221;) and the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August&#160;2020 (the &#8220; 2020 Stock Split &#8221;), and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.

Tesla believes that the information provided above and within the &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8221; section of this proxy statement demonstrates that Tesla&#8217;s executive compensation program was designed appropriately and is working to ensure management&#8217;s interests are aligned with our stockholders&#8217; interests to support long-term value creation. Proposed Resolution Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote &#8220;FOR&#8221; the following resolution at the 2024 Annual Meeting: &#8220;RESOLVED, that the Company&#8217;s stockholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company&#8217;s Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure.&#8221; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote FOR the Tesla proposal for a non-binding advisory vote approving executive compensation. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 17 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Background and Process of the Special Committee Proposal Three and Proposal Four are being presented for votes of the Company&#8217;s stockholders following the recommendations of a special committee of the Board (the &#8220; Special Committee &#8221;) and the Board. The findings and recommendations of the Special Committee and the Board are presented in Proposal Three and Proposal Four, which follow this summary. This is only a summary of the background and process of the Special Committee. The background and process of the Special Committee&#8217;s review is set forth in Part&#160;2 of its report (the &#8220; Special Committee Report &#8221;), which is attached hereto as Annex E and incorporated by reference herein. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Special Committee Report. Our stockholders are encouraged to read the entirety of the Special Committee Report for further information regarding the background and process of the Special Committee. Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is the sole member of the Special Committee. Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson is an outside director who joined Tesla&#8217;s Board in December&#160;2018. She has served in senior management and director roles at public companies for three decades, rising through the ranks to the C-Suite at two Fortune 500 public companies. Among other positions, she served as the Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., and she is currently a director of McKesson Corporation and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. She was a practicing lawyer before pivoting to management. Proposal Three relates to the proposed redomestication of the Company from Delaware to Texas. The Board discussed the question of redomestication at two special meetings in early February&#160;2024. On February&#160;4, 2024, the Board, including Mr.&#160;Musk, met and discussed the matter. The Board addressed the public narrative that Mr.&#160;Musk had already decided the issue for the Company and that Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s post on the social media platform X, which says &#8220;Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,&#8221; was a reflexive reaction to the ruling in Tornetta v. Elon Musk, et al. , No. 2018-0408-KSJM (the &#8220; Tornetta Opinion &#8221;). The discussion reflected the fact that outside directors as well as management had previously explored the possibility of a redomestication (though without coming to a decision one way or the other). At this meeting, the Board determined that, regardless of Mr. Musk&#8217;s post, the Board would only consider redomestication at this time after an appropriate process and timeline, and based on an evaluation of the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. The Board met again on February&#160;10, 2024, without Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk. The five directors present were Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, JB Straubel and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. These directors concluded that a majority of the Board was independent and disinterested with respect to redomestication. They nevertheless decided to create a Special Committee to consider the redomestication issue out of an abundance of caution, in light of the Tornetta Opinion and the high degree of public attention. Accordingly, these five directors unanimously voted to form the Special Committee and to appoint Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Joe Gebbia as members. The Board charged the Committee with considering whether it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to change its corporate domicile, and if so, to which jurisdiction. Among other things, the Special Committee had the authority to: determine the Company&#8217;s decision on the redomestication issue; consider all alternatives, including whether to remain in Delaware or redomesticate to any other jurisdiction; determine whether to condition any redomestication on a particular stockholder vote standard; determine its own timing without any deadline; select and retain advisors at the Company&#8217;s expense; and obtain information from and direct the Company&#8217;s officers, employees, and advisors as it deemed necessary and appropriate. In the Special Committee&#8217;s judgment, it was fully empowered to discharge its mandate. &#160; 18 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The Special Committee began its work and analysis shortly thereafter. As the Special Committee considered the redomestication question, it concluded that if it made a determination to redomesticate, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation should also be addressed in some way at the same time. Otherwise, a potential redomestication could be wrongly perceived as being made in response to the Tornetta Opinion and with the intent to award Mr.&#160;Musk compensation in a different jurisdiction that he could not get in Delaware. And, if stockholders were not told of any then-existing plans for Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation, the stockholder vote on redomestication could be subject to attack as not fully informed. Accordingly, the Special Committee discussed how Mr. Musk&#8217;s compensation might be addressed if there were a decision to redomesticate. According to the Special Committee Report, Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson, as a member of the Compensation Committee, was aware that Mr.&#160;Musk had made it clear that he believes it is unfair to not be paid for his work as agreed. She was also aware that the Company was evaluating options regarding Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation, and that the Compensation Committee had not taken any steps to prepare or negotiate a new, forward-looking compensation plan. The Special Committee noted that it then instructed its counsel to inquire about the Company&#8217;s current plans, if any, regarding Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation. They learned that an appeal of the Tornetta Opinion was being planned, and the Company also was evaluating seeking ratification of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan via a new stockholder vote. In light of this information, the Special Committee determined to request that the Board expand the Special Committee&#8217;s authority. The Board did so on March&#160;5, 2024, as requested. Specifically, the Board delegated additional authority to the Special Committee to decide whether, if there is a stockholder vote on redomestication, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s 2018 CEO Performance Award should be ratified at the same time, as well as potential disclosures about Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation that might need to be made to ensure stockholders were informed in voting on redomestication. The Special Committee concluded it was again fully empowered. In addition to the powers it already had, the Special Committee gained the authority to: determine the Company&#8217;s decision on the ratification question; consider all alternatives, including not seeking ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award; and determine whether to condition any ratification on a particular stockholder vote standard. The Special Committee noted that on March&#160;6, 2024, after the Board expanded the Special Committee&#8217;s mandate, Mr.&#160;Gebbia withdrew from the Special Committee. Mr.&#160;Gebbia explained that he was stepping down from the Special Committee out of an abundance of caution because of the potential for unfair attacks based on perceived conflicts of interest. He stepped down entirely of his own accord, and not because of any concern by the Special Committee regarding his independence. After Mr.&#160;Gebbia stepped down, Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson became a committee of one. According to the Special Committee Report, the Special Committee discussed with the Chair of the Board, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and management the possibility of accelerating the in-process search for new independent directors, and adding any new director(s) to the Special Committee. The Special Committee reported that the timing of the ongoing director search ultimately did not fit with the Special Committee&#8217;s work, and the Special Committee determined there was no reason to delay its work based on the possibility that additional directors would be added to the Board at some point in the future. According to the Special Committee Report, in order to assist the Special Committee in its work, the Special Committee retained multiple advisors. After the Special Committee conducted interviews with multiple law firms, the Special Committee retained Kristen Seeger and John Skakun of Sidley Austin LLP (&#8220; Sidley &#8221;) as its counsel. The Special Committee also determined that it would benefit from being advised by Delaware counsel, a corporate law and governance expert and an investment bank. For each role, Sidley assessed multiple leading candidates, with a focus on both quality and independence. Sidley recommended and the Special Committee retained the following additional advisors: (i)&#160;A. Thompson Bayliss of Abrams &amp; Bayliss LLP, as its Delaware counsel, (ii)&#160;Professor Anthony Casey of the University of Chicago Law School, as its corporate law and governance expert, and (iii)&#160;Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. (&#8220; Houlihan &#8221;), as its financial advisor. The Special Committee determined that each of its advisors is independent. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 19 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; According to the Special Committee Report, the Special Committee concluded that it is independent and disinterested with respect to all aspects of its mandate. This conclusion rested on an evaluation of the Special Committee by its counsel, as well as the Special Committee&#8217;s evaluation of the independence and disinterestedness of its counsel and other advisors both before and after retention. The Special Committee reported that since its formation on February&#160;10, 2024, the Special Committee met 16 times (prior to its final approval meeting on April 16, 2024) for more than 26 total hours. Outside of meetings, the Special Committee spent more than 200 hours working on this matter, including reviewing a significant amount of written materials and communicating with its counsel. The Special Committee and its counsel had extraordinary access to and assistance from the Company. Every request for information or resources was fully granted. All seven other directors and five members of management were interviewed. At the Special Committee&#8217;s request, its counsel visited the Company&#8217;s headquarters. Furthermore, the Special Committee spoke with the Company&#8217;s external auditor, instructed its counsel to request relevant information from the Company, and reviewed documents including Professor Anthony Casey&#8217;s report, Houlihan&#8217;s report, numerous legal decisions, letters from stockholders, and academic articles. The Special Committee reported that it took the time it needed. At the outset, the Special Committee worked with its counsel to assess the time necessary to conduct a thorough, well-designed process. The Special Committee decided that, if it determined that any matter should be voted on by stockholders, the vote should be at Tesla&#8217;s annual meeting because that would give the greatest number of stockholders an opportunity to voice their views. So the Special Committee&#8217;s counsel sought to have the previously-selected date for the annual meeting pushed back by more than a month, in order to give the Special Committee the time that it deemed appropriate to complete its process. Following a negotiation over various potential dates, the Company agreed to the Special Committee&#8217;s request and moved the date of the annual meeting from May&#160;8, 2024 to June&#160;13, 2024. The Special Committee always reserved the right to take additional time if necessary, and expressly stated that to the Company. The Special Committee reported that it reached its final decisions on redomestication and on ratification on its own timeline, and would have taken additional time for either question if it believed that was necessary. &#160; 20 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Proposal Three Tesla Proposal to Approve the Redomestication of Tesla from Delaware to Texas by Conversion Following the recommendations of the Special Committee, the Board, with Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves, has determined to recommend that our stockholders approve the conversion of the Company from a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the &#8220; Delaware Corporation &#8221;) to a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Texas (the &#8220; Texas Corporation &#8221;) and adopt the resolutions of the Board approving the redomestication attached as Annex D to this Proxy Statement, as more fully described in this Proposal Three, and has determined that the redomestication is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

Principal Terms of the Texas Redomestication The Texas Redomestication, if approved by our stockholders, will be effected through a conversion pursuant to Section&#160;266 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#8220; DGCL &#8221;) and Title 1, Chapter&#160;10, Subchapter C of the Texas Business Organizations Code (&#8220; TBOC &#8221;), as set forth in the plan of conversion (the &#8220; Plan of Conversion &#8221;), included as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. Approval of this Proposal Three (the &#8220; Texas Redomestication Proposal &#8221;) will constitute approval of the Plan of Conversion. Through the adoption of the Plan of Conversion, upon the Texas Redomestication: &#8226; The Company will continue in existence as a Texas corporation and will continue to operate our business under the current name, &#8220;Tesla, Inc.&#8221; &#8203; &#8226; The affairs of the Company will cease to be governed by Delaware law at the time the Plan of Conversion is effective and will be subject to Texas law. See &#8220; Comparison of Stockholder Rights under Delaware and Texas Law &#8221; below. &#8203; &#8226; The Company will cease to be governed by our existing charter and bylaws and will be instead subject to the provisions of the proposed Texas Certificate of Formation (the &#8220; Texas Charter &#8221;) and the proposed Texas Bylaws (the &#8220; Texas Bylaws &#8221;), forms of which are included as Annex B and Annex C , respectively, to this Proxy Statement. See &#8220; Certain Differences Between Delaware Charter and Bylaws and Texas Charter and Bylaws &#8221; below. &#8203; &#8226; The Texas Redomestication will not result in any change in headquarters, business, jobs, management, properties, location of any of our offices or facilities, number of employees, obligations, assets, liabilities or net worth (other than as a result of the costs related to the Texas Redomestication). &#8203; &#8226; Each outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&#8220; Delaware Corporation Common Stock &#8221;), will automatically become one outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Texas Corporation (&#8220; Texas Corporation Common Stock &#8221;) pursuant to the Plan of Conversion. &#8203; &#8226; Stockholders will not need to exchange their existing stock certificates for new stock certificates. &#8203; &#8226; Each outstanding restricted stock unit, option or right to acquire shares of Delaware Corporation Common Stock will continue in existence and automatically become a restricted stock unit, option or right to acquire an equal number of shares of the Texas Corporation Common Stock under the same terms and conditions. &#8203; &#8226; Our common stock will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;TSLA.&#8221; We do not expect any interruption in the trading of our common stock as a result of the Texas Redomestication. &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 21 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; If our stockholders approve the Texas Redomestication, we anticipate that the Texas Redomestication will become effective as soon as practicable following the 2024 Annual Meeting (the &#8220; Effective Time &#8221;). In connection with the Texas Redomestication, the Company intends to make filings with the Secretary of State of Texas and the Secretary of State of Delaware, and does not anticipate making any other filings to effect the Texas Redomestication. Nonetheless, we may face legal challenges to the Texas Redomestication, including, among others, stockholder challenges under Delaware law, seeking to prevent the Texas Redomestication. The Texas Redomestication may be delayed by the Board or the Plan of Conversion may be terminated and abandoned by action of the Board at any time prior to the Effective Time of the Texas Redomestication, whether before or after the approval by our stockholders, if the Board determines for any reason that such delay or abandonment would be in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, as the case may be. Background of the Proposal General As part of their ongoing oversight, direction, and management of the Company&#8217;s business, certain outside directors of the Company and management have, from time to time, considered and explored the issue of the Company&#8217;s jurisdiction of incorporation without reaching a decision. These discussions were in response to a number of factors including the relocation of the Company&#8217;s corporate headquarters and certain operations from California to Texas in 2021 and views that the legal landscape in Delaware is evolving (including, without limitation, uncertainty expressed by certain directors and management on how Delaware law will be applied to the Company in certain circumstances). Then, on January&#160;30, 2024, the Delaware Court of Chancery (the &#8220; Delaware Court &#8221;) issued the Tornetta Opinion, the post-trial opinion finding that, among other things, the Board breached its fiduciary duties in approving the 2018 CEO Performance Award for our Chief Executive Officer, Mr.&#160;Musk, which had been unanimously approved by our independent directors and approved by approximately 73% of all votes cast by our disinterested stockholders in 2018 and that rescission of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was the appropriate remedy. Following the Tornetta Opinion, on January&#160;30, 2024, Mr.&#160;Musk ran a poll on X asking whether Tesla should &#8220;change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?&#8221; Of 1,102,554 votes on X, 87.1% were in favor. The following day, Mr.&#160;Musk posted on X that &#8220;Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.&#8221; Mr.&#160;Musk made other posts on X regarding the same subject in the days following the Tornetta Opinion. Notwithstanding these communications, redomestication is a Board decision, not a decision for a chief executive officer. And on February&#160;4, 2024, the Board met to discuss these issues, among others, including the multi-year history of Company discussions regarding a potential redomestication. On February&#160;10, 2024, the Board met again, without Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk participating, to further discuss these issues. At that meeting, the Board determined to evaluate more formally a redomestication. In order to evaluate whether to redomesticate Tesla, as described further under the section entitled &#8220; Background and Process of the Special Committee &#8221;, the Board formed the Special Committee, which ultimately was comprised of Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, as described under the section entitled &#8220; Background and Process of the Special Committee .&#8221; The Board delegated to the Special Committee the full authority and power of the Board to consider, evaluate, and determine whether it would be in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders to change its corporate domicile, and if so, to which jurisdiction, and if so, in what manner (including, without limitation, the manner of the stockholder vote), and authorized and empowered the Special Committee to prepare such analysis and make such conclusions as it deemed appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders with respect to a potential redomestication, and the Board resolved not to recommend, authorize, approve, or otherwise endorse any redomestication proposal without the prior favorable recommendation of the Special Committee. &#160; 22 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The Special Committee&#8217;s Evaluation of the Texas Redomestication Evaluation of Jurisdictions: Narrowing the Focus The Special Committee considered a precise question: where should this Company be incorporated at this time . The Special Committee initially considered all U.S. states as well as the possibility of incorporating outside of the U.S. It narrowed its focus in stages, first to 10 states, then 5, and finally to a binary choice between remaining incorporated in Delaware and reincorporating in one alternative jurisdiction. At each stage, the Special Committee conducted an increasingly in-depth analysis of factors it believed were relevant to Tesla. The Special Committee narrowed its focus to US jurisdictions because Tesla is an American company. It selected 10 states for further consideration&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because each has a significant number of major public companies incorporated in them, and because Tesla&#8217;s most significant US operations are in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas. For this group of 10, the Special Committee reviewed each state&#8217;s corporate laws at a high level and concluded they were substantially similar. The Special Committee therefore saw no reason to move to a jurisdiction Tesla has no current significant connection to, and narrowed its focus to 5&#160;states: California, which has two factories; Delaware, the current state of incorporation; New York, which has a Gigafactory; Nevada, which also has a Gigafactory; and Texas, which is Tesla&#8217;s corporate headquarters and has a Gigafactory. The Special Committee then conducted further analysis, including of academic scholarship on the development of corporate law in the US and on companies&#8217; incorporation decisions. The Special Committee continued to find no reason to pick one jurisdiction based on its corporate law. This was not surprising, as each state&#8217;s law operates under the same federal constitutional framework, draws on a common law heritage, and evolved in light of&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and in competition with&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;each other. The differentiator at this stage therefore became Tesla&#8217;s home state. Academic research shows that more than 90% of companies are incorporated either in Delaware or in their home state, and identifies a range of reasons for this. So the Special Committee determined that the best potential alternative to Delaware was Texas, and resolved to choose between those two states. Evaluation of Texas and Delaware The final stage of the Special Committee&#8217;s redomestication decision was an in-depth comparison of remaining incorporated in Delaware or reincorporating in Texas. As explained further below, the Special Committee concluded that Delaware and Texas provide substantially equivalent bundles of economic, governance, and litigation rights for stockholders, at least on net (i.e., balancing relevant considerations against one another) and as relevant to Tesla. This left three differentiating factors in the Special Committee&#8217;s view: Texas is Tesla&#8217;s home state; Texas statutory law on corporate constituencies would better align with Tesla&#8217;s mission-driven culture; and Delaware has an established and respected business court and the largest body of corporate case law in the country, whereas Texas just created a business court. The Special Committee balanced these considerations and concluded that, in its business judgment, it is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders for the Company to reincorporate in Texas. The Special Committee, in this evaluation, included an examination of the effect of the reincorporation on the economic, governance, and litigation rights of stockholders: Economic Rights. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee considered whether there was any reason to believe that Tesla shares would be economically less valuable under Texas law than under Delaware law. The Special Committee concluded, based on the advice of its financial and academic advisors, that there was no convincing evidence that reincorporating in Texas would affect Tesla&#8217;s market value. In reaching this conclusion, the Special Committee and its advisors considered, among other things, related to market practices, that a company&#8217;s U.S. state of incorporation is not a factor commonly used in valuation methodologies. The Special Committee&#8217;s financial advisor also considered whether there was evidence of a &#8220;Delaware premium&#8221; through three quantitative analyses. First, they evaluated four market-implied valuation multiples from 2019 through 2023 for Fortune 500 companies: enterprise value/revenue; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 23 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; enterprise value/EBITDA; market capitalization/earnings; and market capitalization/book value. They did not find any observable valuation premium attributable to Delaware incorporation. Second, the Special Committee&#8217;s financial advisor also analyzed market return metrics for Fortune 500 companies from 2014 through 2023, and similarly found no observable premium attributable to Delaware incorporation. Finally, the Special Committee&#8217;s financial advisor reviewed four case studies of redomestications from Delaware to Texas over the last decade. They reported no observable pattern between redomestication and total stockholder return over the periods studied. In addition, the Special Committee considered conclusions from its academic advisor that existing academic literature strongly suggests that a &#8220;Delaware premium&#8221; is non-existent or unknowable. The Special Committee concluded, based on the advice of its financial and academic advisors, that there is no reason to believe that being incorporated in Delaware increases Tesla&#8217;s market value. Of the S&amp;P 500, approximately 35% are domiciled outside of Delaware. Seven of the top 20 by market capitalization are incorporated in their home state: Apple, Costco, Eli Lilly, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Microsoft, and Proctor &amp; Gamble. Tesla would make eight. Notably, the Special Committee saw no indication that Microsoft&#8217;s earlier reincorporation from Delaware to its home state of Washington had a negative effect on Microsoft. In addition, the Special Committee evaluated whether and confirmed that the Texas Redomestication would not materially alter any other economic rights of Tesla stockholders. For example, Texas law would not alter the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or buyback stock. As discussed below, at the Special Committee&#8217;s request, the Company confirmed that the Texas Redomestication will not have any materially adverse accounting, tax, or other financial implications, and will not affect the public trading of the Company&#8217;s shares. Further, the Texas Redomestication will result in the Company saving $250,000 per year in franchise tax payments to Delaware. Governance Rights. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee concluded that governance rights are effectively the same in both states. For example, both Delaware and Texas have similar rules on classified boards, the removal of directors, charter and bylaw amendments, blank check preferred stock, stock buybacks, dividends, and appraisal. Where there may appear to be distinctions, the Special Committee concluded that: most were differences in default rules that could be resolved in a Texas charter and bylaws (see the section &#8220; Certain Differences Between Delaware Charter and Bylaws and Texas Charter and Bylaws &#8221; below for the Company&#8217;s summary of certain differences between the Delaware Charter (as defined below) and Delaware Bylaws (as defined below) and the proposed Texas Charter and Texas Bylaws); some made no difference at least to Tesla (see the section &#8220; Comparison of Stockholder Rights under Delaware and Texas Law &#8221; below for the Company&#8217;s summary of certain differences between Delaware and Texas law); and one&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Texas&#8217;s constituency statute&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;did not substantially alter stockholders&#8217; rights but does matter to Tesla (see the section &#8220; Certain Differences Between Delaware and Texas Law &#8221; below for the Company&#8217;s summary of certain differences between Delaware and Texas law). Litigation Rights. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee and its advisors engaged deeply with a wide range of litigation topics and identified no areas in which Texas and Delaware law meaningfully diverged on matters of substance. In most areas the Special Committee examined, Texas and Delaware law apply essentially the same substantive rule, though Texas sometimes articulates it a bit differently. These include fiduciary duties owed to the corporation and the stockholders collectively, the corporate opportunities doctrine, director exculpation, indemnification, advancement, the business judgment rule, and the entire fairness standard of judicial review. In addition, the Special Committee considered that Delaware law has addressed a number of issues impacting public companies that Texas law has not (yet), including Caremark oversight claims, public company conflicted controller transactions, and intermediate scrutiny of defensive tactics. However, Texas&#8217;s silence in these areas does not mean that Texas law is or will be meaningfully different from Delaware law. Texas courts often look to Delaware law to fill gaps in Texas law, and the Special Committee and its advisors concluded that there was no reason to believe that Texas law would provide substantially lesser litigation rights than Delaware in areas where it is currently silent. The Special Committee and its advisors identified two important &#160; 24 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; areas with differences between Texas and Delaware stockholder litigation: procedural approaches to stockholder derivative claims and the fact that Texas recently created a specialized business court system, which is set to open on September&#160;1, 2024. The Special Committee and its Delaware, Texas, and academic advisors concluded that these differences were procedural. In addition to its own analysis with its advisors, the Special Committee took note of commentary comparing Delaware and Texas law, including of ISS&#8217;s prior statement that &#8220;reincorporation from Delaware to Texas would appear to have a neutral impact on shareholders&#8217; rights,&#8221; and Glass Lewis&#8217; prior statement that &#8220;in most respects, the corporate statutes in Delaware and Texas are comparable.&#8221; Both have previously recommended voting in favor of multiple Delaware-to-Texas reincorporations. Recommendation of the Special Committee At a meeting of the Special Committee held on April&#160;16, 2024, after reviewing and considering the factors and considerations deemed relevant by the Special Committee, and after investigating and considering the benefits and detriments, for the reasons set forth in the Special Committee Report and summarized below under the caption &#8220; Reasons for the Texas Redomestication &#8221;, the Special Committee adopted resolutions determining that the Texas Redomestication is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, and that the Board should submit reincorporation for approval and adoption by the stockholders of the Company at the 2024 Annual Meeting of stockholders. The Special Committee also recommended that (1)&#160;the Board and management take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Special Committee&#8217;s determination consistent with legal obligations; (2)&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk be recused from the Board&#8217;s deliberations and vote on this matter because of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s prior posts on X about reincorporation; (3)&#160;the stockholder vote on reincorporation be conditioned on approval by a majority of votes cast by non-Musk-affiliated stockholders, for the same reasons; and (4)&#160;the Board recommend that stockholders vote for the Texas Redomestication based on the Special Committee&#8217;s determination that reincorporating in Texas is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. The resolution of the Board approving the Texas Redomestication through the adoption of the Plan of Conversion is included as Annex D to this Proxy Statement (the &#8220; Texas Redomestication Resolution &#8221;). In support of its recommendation, the Special Committee delivered the Special Committee Report to the Board, dated April&#160;12, 2024, which is included as Annex&#160;E to this Proxy Statement. The summary of the Special Committee Report, included in this proposal is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full Special Committee Report, which is incorporated by reference herein. The Special Committee considered the factors discussed in the Special Committee Report, which are summarized above in the section &#8220; The Special Committee&#8217;s Evaluation of the Redomestication &#8221;. The Special Committee considered, among other things, a number of factors relating to the procedural safeguards that it believes were and are present to permit the Special Committee to represent effectively the interests of all of the Company&#8217;s stockholders, including stockholders other than Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk. The Special Committee believes these factors support its determinations and recommendations regarding the Texas Redomestication. The following procedural safeguards are listed in no particular order: &#8226; Independence and Disinterestedness: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee examined its own independence and concluded that it consisted of an independent (for purposes of serving on the Special Committee) and disinterested director. &#8203; &#8226; Procedural Safeguards: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee was empowered to freely select its own independent legal and financial advisors and to consider the potential redomestication of the Company in another jurisdiction (including the ability to choose to remain in Delaware). &#8203; &#8226; Prior Special Committee Approval: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Board in establishing the Special Committee had decided and resolved not to approve any redomestication transaction without the prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee. &#8203; &#8226; Active Involvement and Oversight: &#160;&#160;&#160;The numerous formal and informal meetings and communications held by the Special Committee over an approximately eight-week period &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 25 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; (with its legal advisors present and with other advisors regularly present) to discuss and evaluate, among other things, the process for exploring a potential redomestication, and the Special Committee&#8217;s active oversight of the process and negotiations with the Company. The Special Committee was actively engaged in this process on a regular basis and was provided with access to Tesla management and its advisors, as and when requested, in connection with the evaluation process. &#8226; Independent Advice: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee selected and engaged its own independent legal and other advisors throughout its review and evaluation of a potential redomestication. &#8203; &#8226; Consideration of Relevant Facts and Information: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee made its evaluation of a potential redomestication based upon the factors discussed in the Special Committee Report, which is summarized in this Proxy Statement. &#8203; &#8226; No Obligation to Recommend that the Board Should Approve: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee had no obligation to recommend that the Board should approve the Texas Redomestication (or any redomestication). &#8203; &#8226; Approval by Majority of Non-Musk Affiliated Stockholders: &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee recommended that the Texas Redomestication requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the 2024 Annual Meeting by non-Musk affiliated stockholders. &#8203; Further, the Special Committee ultimately determined that the uncertainties, risks, and potentially negative factors relevant to the Texas Redomestication were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Texas Redomestication, as explained in the Special Committee Report. It therefore recommended that the Board should approve the Texas Redomestication. Recommendation of the Board Following the determination of the Special Committee that the Texas Redomestication is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders and the recommendations of the Special Committee, and after considering the Special Committee&#8217;s determination and the Special Committee Report, the Board met on April 9, 2024, April 13, 2024 and April 16, 2024, with Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves. On April 16, 2024, the Board determined that the Texas Redomestication is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, approved the Texas Redomestication, directed that the Texas Redomestication be submitted for consideration by our stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting and recommended that our stockholders approve the Texas Redomestication and adopt the Texas Redomestication Resolution and the Plan of Conversion. In particular, the Board (with Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves) adopted the Texas Redomestication Resolution and recommended that the stockholders of the Company approve the Texas Redomestication Resolution, adopt the Plan of Conversion and approve the conversion of the Company from a Delaware Corporation to a Texas Corporation. Pursuant to Section&#160;266 of the DGCL, the Texas Redomestication Resolution is hereby submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, with the Board&#8217;s recommendation that stockholders vote for the Texas Redomestication Resolution. Reasons for the Texas Redomestication The determination of the Special Committee and the determination of our Board that the Texas Redomestication is in the best interest of the Company and all of its stockholders, and the decision of the Special Committee to recommend to the Board that it recommend that the Company&#8217;s stockholders vote to approve the Texas Redomestication, were the result of deliberation and consideration. The Special Committee Report explains the Special Committee&#8217;s reasoning for its determination and is summarized herein. The following summary of the key considerations of the Special Committee and the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Special Committee Report attached to this Proxy Statement. Stockholders are encouraged to read the full text of the Special Committee Report for additional detail regarding the analysis of the Special Committee on the proposed Texas Redomestication. &#160; 26 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Tesla&#8217;s Home and Future Are in Texas Tesla is All-In on Texas. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Board believes that our corporate identity is intertwined with our Texas corporate headquarters and that redomiciling in Texas would be consistent with this trajectory. In 2021, we relocated our corporate headquarters from California to Austin, Texas. Since this relocation, Texas has increasingly become a focal point for Tesla&#8217;s corporate identity. Executive management is based in Texas, as are manufacturing, operations and engineering employees. Our corporate headquarters and principal manufacturing facility&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Gigafactory Texas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;covers over 10&#160;million square feet of factory floor. We continue to invest in the expansion of our campus, which we believe is the second-largest building by volume in the world. Gigafactory Texas is also the manufacturing hub for our new products. It is the manufacturing hub for the Model Y, which, as of January&#160;24, 2024, was the best-selling car in the world, and is home to the Cybertruck. Our corporate identity is becoming inextricably tied to our Texas corporate headquarters, and we believe that a change in our state of incorporation would be consistent with this trajectory. Texas is our home state, and we are committed to Texas. Reincorporating in Texas also builds on Tesla&#8217;s relationships with the state and local communities. These relationships&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;with government actors, with employees and with other stakeholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are critical to Tesla. Academic research reviewed by the Special Committee recognizes that &#8220;there is value inherent in home-state incorporation&#8221; because it can strengthen such relationships. Fully becoming a Texas company would send a strong signal of Tesla&#8217;s commitment to the state and local community that have done so much for it already, and that are so important to Tesla&#8217;s future. By comparison, we have no material operations in Delaware. Our executives and management do not operate out of Delaware. We do not have our Board meetings in Delaware, and the Board does not otherwise visit Delaware as part of their site visits. It was chosen as our state of incorporation solely because of its legal framework. As discussed above, the Special Committee and the Board found no advantage to remaining incorporated in Delaware that justifies a split between the Company&#8217;s legal home and its physical home. There is Value in Local Decision-Making. &#160;&#160;&#160;Another advantage of home-state incorporation is that the legislators and judges making corporate law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the juries deciding fact disputes in corporate cases&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are drawn from the community in which the company operates. Corporate law and litigation often overlap with and impact business, employment, and operational matters. And Tesla is not a cookie-cutter public company. The Special Committee and the Board believe that local decision-makers have a deeper understanding of our business, and therefore are best situated to make decisions about our corporate governance. Home-State Incorporation is Common and Intuitively Makes Sense. &#160;&#160;&#160;Successful companies are incorporated in many U.S. states and other jurisdictions outside of the United States. Approximately 35% of S&amp;P 500 companies are not incorporated in Delaware, instead choosing to incorporate in a variety of other jurisdictions. Some of the most successful consumer-facing companies in the United States are headquartered and incorporated in the same state, demonstrating identification with their home state, including, among others, Apple and Microsoft. The following map illustrates the geographic diversity of some of these companies. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 27 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; We are not the first to consider redomiciling from Delaware to another jurisdiction. Southwest Airlines Co. is also incorporated in Texas. Some companies, including Microsoft, have reincorporated from Delaware to their home state in order to reunite their legal and physical homes. One of the reasons given by Microsoft when it left Delaware was that Washington was &#8220;the location of the Company&#8217;s world headquarters and the location of its primary research and development efforts.&#8221; Similarly, the Special Committee and the Board believe there is value in unifying Tesla&#8217;s legal and physical homes. Tesla is a Mission-Driven Company We are driven by our mission to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy, and our mission is a cornerstone of our culture. It is critical to recruitment, motivation and retention, from the factory floor to the boardroom. For some of our directors, our mission is a major reason why they choose to serve on the Board. The Special Committee and the Board considered that Texas, unlike Delaware, has an express statutory provision that would allow (though not require) Tesla&#8217;s directors and officers to consider the Company&#8217;s mission in exercising their fiduciary duties. The Special Committee and the Board do not expect this would change the way Tesla operates, but considered the symbolic value in aligning Tesla&#8217;s mission-driven culture with Texas&#8217; law. Litigation Forum Considerations Do Not Alter the Balance The Special Committee and the Board considered the likely relative predictability of Delaware and Texas law based on differences in their judicial systems. Delaware has the most respected corporate judicial system in the country and has an extensive body of corporate case law. In contrast, Texas is in the process of forming a specialized business court system (which is set to open in September&#160;2024) and has a smaller body of corporate case law. This factor did not alter the balance in the Special Committee&#8217;s evaluation of Delaware and Texas. In making this determination, the Special Committee and the Board were persuaded by the broadly held academic view&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;echoed by at least three former Delaware Supreme Court Justices and one former Chancellor on the Delaware Court of Chancery&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that Delaware law can be indeterminate because of its use of broad, flexible standards that are applied to individual cases in a highly fact-specific way. As described in the Special Committee Report, scholarship demonstrates a high level of reversal rate for decisions of the Delaware Court of Chancery. This focus on precise facts and circumstances means Delaware decisions may be less predictable for an innovative company like Tesla. Although Texas has less corporate case law, as the Special Committee&#8217;s corporate law and governance expert pointed out, Texas &#8220;has a more code-based corporate governance regime,&#8221; and so does not depend on cases to set out the law as much as Delaware. &#160; 28 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Moreover, the Special Committee and the Board do not think that the Texas business courts should be avoided simply because they are new. Doing new things is part of Tesla&#8217;s DNA, and how it has become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Certain Risks Associated with the Texas Redomestication Although the Special Committee and the Board believe that the Texas Redomestication is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, there can be no assurance that the Texas Redomestication will result in all or any of the benefits described in this Proxy Statement, including the benefits of or resulting from incorporation under Texas or the application of Texas law to the internal affairs of the Company. For the Company&#8217;s comparison of stockholders&#8217; rights and the material substantive provisions that apply to the Board and executive officers under Delaware and Texas law, see &#8220; Comparison of Stockholder Rights under Delaware and Texas Law &#8221; below. Extensive Delaware Case Law and Established Court System The Delaware Court of Chancery and Supreme Court are highly respected and experienced business courts. They have an extensive body of case law. Trials are before judges who are experts in corporate law and appointed for 12 year terms. Delaware statutory law is regularly updated by the legislature. The Delaware system has long and widely been lauded for its expertise. On the other side of the ledger, Texas&#8217;s business courts were just created and will not start hearing cases until September&#160;2024. They will, at least initially, have less existing corporate case law to draw on. Business court judges will be appointed for two-year terms, but there is no track record of their qualifications or experience. Plus, dispositive motion practice is more limited in Texas, and even corporate governance cases will be tried to juries rather than judges. How the Texas business court system will function cannot be known for certain. Notwithstanding the conclusions of the Special Committee and the Board, it is nevertheless possible that familiarity with Delaware and perceptions regarding the breadth and stability of Delaware corporate law may impact the views of certain investors or certain members of the financial services industry, as well as potential director and officer candidates. It is possible that these external perceptions regarding Delaware law may impact the behaviors of such third parties, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Certain Differences Between Delaware and Texas Law Although the Special Committee and the Board have determined that the rights of stockholders under the DGCL and the TBOC are substantially equivalent, at least on net (i.e., balancing relevant considerations against one another) and as relevant to the Company, the DGCL and Delaware case law collectively are different in certain respects than the TBOC and existing Texas case law in ways that may affect the rights of our stockholders. Please see the Company&#8217;s summary of certain differences in the section entitled &#8220; Comparison of Stockholder Rights under Delaware and Texas Law. &#8221; For instance, as further explained in the Company&#8217;s summary below, under the TBOC, a shareholder may inspect a Texas corporation&#8217;s books and records, subject to certain limitations, if such shareholder holds at least 5% of the outstanding shares of stock of the Texas corporation or has been a holder of shares for at least six&#160;months. The DGCL, on the other hand, does not require that a stockholder hold a certain number of shares or hold such shares for a stated period of time prior to exercising their books and records inspection rights. Thus, it is possible that some of our stockholders entitled to make a books and records demand today (as stockholders in a Delaware corporation) will not be able to make a similar demand following the Texas Redomestication. Further, the TBOC expressly provides that it does not prohibit directors or officers from considering, approving or taking an action that promotes or has the effect of promoting a social, charitable or environmental purpose. Under Delaware law, on the other hand, there is no express statutory authority to consider such purposes, and fiduciary duties in most circumstances merely require directors to seek to maximize the value of the corporation for the long-term benefit of the stockholders unless the corporation is specifically incorporated as a public benefit corporation. As a result, as a Texas corporation, it is possible that our directors may consider the interests of other constituents. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 29 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The Special Committee identified a handful of areas where the rule in Texas differed in some respect from the rule in Delaware. These were generally procedural and not relevant to Tesla in the view of the Special Committee and its advisors. The most potentially important area is related to antitakeover protections. Both Delaware and Texas permit a range of antitakeover defenses, including poison pills. Both have business combination provisions, though they apply at different ownership thresholds: 20% in Texas and 15% in Delaware. Both allow boards of directors to create new vacancies and to fill them, though Texas limits the number of such vacancies that can be filled without a stockholder vote to 2. Another potential area of difference involved cash-out transactions and &#8220; Revlon duties&#8221;: Texas statutes allow directors to take into account &#8220;the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation and the stockholders of the corporation, including the possibility that those interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation.&#8221; Delaware law, at least in certain circumstances, requires directors to accept the highest price reasonably available, though in many circumstances they are allowed to also &#8220;just say no&#8221; to a potential transaction and take into account long-term interests. Transaction Costs We will also incur certain non-recurring costs in connection with the Texas Redomestication, including certain filing fees and legal and other transaction costs. As noted above, we may face legal challenges in connection with the Texas Redomestication, and we may also face additional media scrutiny. We believe a majority of these costs have already been incurred or will be incurred by the submission of the Texas Redomestication Proposal to stockholders regardless of whether the Texas Redomestication is ultimately completed, except for any litigation related expenses that may arise, which we cannot predict. Many of the expenses that will be incurred and other potential transaction costs are difficult to accurately estimate at the present time, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the Texas Redomestication. It is also possible that the Texas Redomestication results in additional litigation, with additional expense, distraction and time, or that it does not diminish the expenses, distraction and time the Company currently spends in litigious disputes. Further, if a court determines that such litigation has merit, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Risks Relating to the Special Committee Certain stockholders may file litigation against Tesla in connection with the Texas Redomestication. If such litigation is filed, a court may find that the Texas Redomestication is not fair to stockholders, even if stockholders approve the Texas Redomestication Proposal, and it may find that the process employed by the Special Committee was not adequate or fair. A court may also find that Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson was not independent with respect to the Texas Redomestication and this proposal notwithstanding the Special Committee&#8217;s determination. Litigation relating to the Texas Redomestication, regardless of merit, may cause us to incur significant expense, distraction and time. Further, if a court determines that claims brought in such litigation are meritorious, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. What Changes After Texas Redomestication? The Texas Redomestication will effect a change in the legal domicile of the Company and other changes, the most significant of which are described below. Following the Texas Redomestication, we will be governed by the TBOC instead of the DGCL, and we will be governed by the Texas Charter and Texas Bylaws. Approval of this Proposal will constitute approval of the Texas Charter and Texas Bylaws. Our current Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the &#8220; Delaware Charter &#8221;) and our current Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended, the &#8220; Delaware Bylaws &#8221;) will no longer be in effect following completion of the Texas Redomestication. Copies of the Delaware Charter and Delaware Bylaws are included as Annex F and Annex G , respectively, to this Proxy Statement. &#160; 30 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Certain Differences Between Delaware Charter and Bylaws and Texas Charter and Bylaws The Texas Charter and Texas Bylaws have been drafted with an intent to reflect the Delaware Charter and Delaware Bylaws to the extent legally possible. Nonetheless, because of differences between the TBOC and the DGCL, certain differences will be in effect. Certain differences between the Texas Charter and the Delaware Charter are summarized below: Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware Charter &#8203; &#8203; Texas Charter &#8203; Shareholder Voting Threshold &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, certain matters subject to a stockholder vote, including certain business transactions including, without limitation, mergers, conversions, sales of substantially all assets, require a default vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, unless the charter specifies a higher voting threshold. The current Delaware Charter does not include a higher voting threshold so the default voting standard for such business transactions applies. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, certain matters subject to a shareholder vote, including &#8220;fundamental business transactions&#8221; such as mergers, sales of substantially all assets, and other transactions, require a default vote of 2/3 of the shareholders of each class, unless the charter specifies a lower voting threshold. Accordingly, the proposed Texas Charter contains language setting the default voting thresholds at a majority standard unless a different standard is specified elsewhere. &#8203; Board of Directors Vacancies &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Charter provides that vacancies on the Board can only be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining members of the Board or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; The TBOC provides that director vacancies may be filled (1)&#160;by a vote of a majority of the remaining members of the board of directors, (2)&#160;by a sole remaining director, or (3)&#160;by a vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock. Additionally, the TBOC prevents a board of directors from filling more than two vacancies caused by an increase in the size of the board of directors between any two annual meetings of shareholders, and any directors appointed or elected by the board of directors or shareholders to fill a vacancy can only serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders (or special meeting called to elect directors). The proposed Texas Charter provides that director vacancies may be filled in any manner permitted by the TBOC, in each case to the extent permitted by the TBOC. &#8203; Action by Written Consent &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Charter prohibits stockholder action by written consent. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, shareholders are required to have the option to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting, and so the proposed Texas Charter provides that shareholders may act by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting. This option most closely aligns with the terms of the current Delaware Charter, which prohibits shareholder action by &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware Charter &#8203; &#8203; Texas Charter &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; written consent. In particular, in light of our widely held shareholder base, we do not believe that action by unanimous written consent is likely. &#8203; Calling of Special Shareholder Meetings &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Charter provides that special stockholder meetings may be called only by the Board, the chairperson of the Board, the chief executive officer, or the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), and may not be called by stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; The proposed Texas Charter provides that special shareholder meetings may be called by the Board of Directors, the chairperson of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the president, or by shareholders holding 50% of the shares entitled to vote on the proposed action of such meeting. Under the TBOC, the president of a corporation is required to have the right to call a shareholder meeting as are shareholders holding a specified&#160;percentage of the shares entitled to vote at such meeting. We have acknowledged that statutory right in the proposed Texas Charter. &#8203; Cancellation of Special Shareholder Meetings &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Charter provides that the Board may cancel, postpone, or reschedule a special stockholder meeting. &#8203; &#8203; Because the TBOC requires that shareholders holding 50% of the shares entitled to vote thereat to be able to call a special meeting of shareholders, the proposed Texas Charter does not provide that the Board of Directors has the right to cancel a special shareholder meeting, although the Board of Directors retains the right to postpone and reschedule shareholder meetings. The proposed Texas Bylaws, however, permit the Board to cancel a special shareholder meeting not called by shareholders. &#8203; Indemnification &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws authorize indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law as it exists or may be amended from time to time. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer against expenses and judgments reasonably incurred by the person in connection with a legal proceeding, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation, provided such a director or officer acted in good faith and reasonably believed: (1)&#160;in the case of a civil, administrative or investigative proceeding, that such person&#8217;s conduct was in or not opposed to &#8203; &#8203; The proposed Texas Charter authorizes the indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law as it exists or may be amended from time to time. Under the TBOC, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer against judgments and expenses reasonably incurred by the director or officer in connection with a legal proceeding if the director or officer: (1)&#160;acted in good faith, (2)&#160;reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in the person&#8217;s official capacity, that the person&#8217;s conduct was in the corporation&#8217;s best interests, and otherwise, that the person&#8217;s conduct was not opposed &#8203; &#160; 32 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware Charter &#8203; &#8203; Texas Charter &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; the best interests of the corporation, or (2)&#160;in the case of a criminal proceeding, that such person had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. In connection with an action by or in the right of the corporation against a director or officer, the corporation may indemnify such director or officer for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such suit: (1)&#160;if such person acted in good faith and a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and (2)&#160;if such person is found liable to the corporation, only if ordered by a court of law. &#8203; &#8203; to the corporation&#8217;s best interests, and (3)&#160;in the case of a criminal proceeding, did not have reasonable cause to believe the person&#8217;s conduct was unlawful. If, however, the director or officer is found liable to the corporation or is found liable on the basis that such director or officer received an improper personal benefit, then indemnification is limited to the reimbursement of reasonable expenses actually incurred. Additionally, no indemnification will be available if a director or officer is found liable for: (1)&#160;willful or intentional misconduct, (2)&#160;breach of the duty of loyalty, or (3)&#160;an act or omission not committed in good faith that constitutes a breach of a duty owed to the corporation. &#8203; Certain differences between the Texas Bylaws and the Delaware Bylaws are as follows: Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware &#8203; &#8203; Texas &#8203; Board of Directors Vacancies &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that vacancies on the Board can only be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining members of the Board or by a sole remaining director, and not by stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; The proposed Texas Bylaws provide that director vacancies may be filled in any manner permitted by the TBOC, in each case to the extent permitted by the TBOC, the effect of which is described in the above comparison summary of the Delaware Charter and the proposed Texas Charter under &#8220;Board of Directors Vacancies.&#8221; &#8203; Action by Written Consent &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, shareholders are required to have the option to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting. The proposed Texas Bylaws set this at the highest standard permitted under the TBOC, which is unanimous written consent. &#8203; Calling of Special Shareholder Meetings &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that special stockholder meetings may be called only by the Board, the chairperson of the Board, the chief executive officer, or the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), and may not be called by stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, shareholders that own a certain&#160;percentage of shares having the right to vote thereat, as specified in the certificate of formation, but not to exceed 50%, are required to have the right to call special shareholder meetings, and the proposed Texas Bylaws provide that holders of not less than 50% of our shares of stock entitled to vote thereat may call a special meeting of shareholders. &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware &#8203; &#8203; Texas &#8203; Cancellation of Special Shareholder Meetings &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that the Board may cancel, postpone, or reschedule a special stockholder meeting. &#8203; &#8203; The proposed Texas Bylaws provide that the Board may not cancel a special shareholder meeting called by shareholders, although the Board retains the right to postpone and reschedule shareholder meetings. The Board may cancel a meeting that is not called by shareholders, to the extent permitted under the TBOC. &#8203; Proxies &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that no proxy authorized by a stockholder is valid after three&#160;years from the date of its execution, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a proxy is not valid for more than eleven&#160;months after the date the proxy is executed, unless otherwise provided by the proxy, and so the proposed Texas Bylaws provide that no proxy shall be voted or acted upon after eleven&#160;months from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. &#8203; Board of Directors Committees &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that no committee of directors shall have the power or authority to (1)&#160;approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (2)&#160;adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws. &#8203; &#8203; The proposed Texas Bylaws provide that committees shall not have the power or authority to (i) approve or adopt, or recommend to the shareholders any action or matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by the TBOC to be submitted to shareholders for approval or which otherwise may not be delegated to a committee, or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the corporation. The proposed Texas Bylaws, by reference to the TBOC, acknowledge that, under the TBOC, a committee of directors is prohibited from taking certain actions. The TBOC provides that a committee of the board of directors may not: (1) amend the certificate of formation, except to: (A)&#160;establish a series of shares; (B)&#160;increase or decrease the number of shares in a series; or (C)&#160;eliminate a series of shares established by the board of directors; &#8203; (2) propose a reduction of stated capital; &#8203; (3) approve a plan of merger, share exchange, or conversion of the &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 34 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware &#8203; &#8203; Texas &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; corporation; (4) recommend to shareholders the sale, lease, or exchange of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the corporation not made in the usual and regular course of its business; &#8203; (5) recommend to the shareholders a voluntary winding up and termination or revocation of a voluntary winding up and termination; &#8203; (6) amend, alter, or repeal the bylaws or adopt new bylaws; &#8203; (7) fill vacancies on the board of directors; &#8203; (8) fill vacancies on or designate alternate members of a committee of the board of directors; &#8203; (9) fill a vacancy to be filled because of an increase in the number of directors; &#8203; (10) elect or remove officers of the corporation or members or alternate members of a committee of the board of directors; &#8203; (11) set the compensation of the members or alternate members of a committee of the board of directors; or &#8203; (12) alter or repeal a resolution of the board of directors that states that it may not be amended or repealed by a committee of the board of directors. &#8203; &#8203; Partly Paid Stock &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws permit the corporation to issue partly paid stock. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, partly paid stock is prohibited due to the TBOC&#8217;s requirement that full consideration for shares be paid before issuance, and so the proposed Texas Bylaws do not provide for the issuance of partly paid stock. &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Issue &#8203; &#8203; Delaware &#8203; &#8203; Texas &#8203; Notice to Shareholders &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws permit the corporation to deliver a single written notice to stockholders who share an address (unless a stockholder objects) and permit the corporation not to give notice where notice would be unlawful. &#8203; &#8203; The TBOC does not currently contain provisions allowing for a single notice to be delivered to multiple shareholders at the same address, and so the right of the corporation to so deliver notice is limited by the TBOC. The TBOC does not have provisions specifically allowing the corporation not to deliver notice where such notice would be unlawful, and so the Texas Bylaws do not contain such provisions. &#8203; Advancement of Expenses &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that expenses incurred by an officer or director in connection with any legal proceedings will be advanced by the corporation upon the corporation&#8217;s receipt of a written request and an undertaking by the person to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to indemnification. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, before a corporation can advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in connection with any legal proceedings, a director or officer is also required to provide, in addition to an undertaking to repay any expenses advanced if such director or officer is ultimately not entitled to indemnification, a written affirmation attesting in good faith to such director&#8217;s or officer&#8217;s compliance with the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification, which requirement is included in the proposed Texas Bylaws. &#8203; Exclusive Forum &#8203; &#8203; The current Delaware Bylaws provide that a state court within the State of Delaware (or, if no Delaware state court has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall serve as the sole and exclusive forum for certain matters relating to the internal affairs of the corporation. The exclusive forum provision in the Delaware Bylaws does not apply to any direct claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220; Securities Act &#8221;) or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220; Exchange Act &#8221;). &#8203; &#8203; The proposed Texas Bylaws provide that the sole and exclusive forum for certain matters relating to the internal affairs of the corporation shall be, first, the Business Court in the Third Business Court Division of the State of Texas (which Division includes the county of our Texas corporate headquarters), unless such court is not then accepting filings or lacks jurisdiction, in which case the exclusive forum shall be either the federal district court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, or if there is not federal jurisdiction then the state district court of Travis County, Texas. The exclusive forum provision in the proposed Texas Bylaws explicitly states that it shall not apply to any direct claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. &#8203; &#160; 36 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Comparison of Stockholder Rights under Delaware and Texas Law The rights of our stockholders are currently governed by the DGCL, Delaware case law, the Delaware Charter and the Delaware Bylaws. Following completion of the Texas Redomestication, the rights of our shareholders will be governed by the TBOC, Texas case law, the Texas Charter and the Texas Bylaws. The Special Committee has found that the corporate laws of Texas and of Delaware are substantially equivalent, at least on net (i.e., balancing relevant considerations against one another) and as relevant to the Company. The statutory corporate laws of Texas, as governed by the TBOC, are similar in many respects to those of Delaware, as governed by the DGCL. However, there are certain individual differences that may relate to your rights as a stockholder, as well as the corporate governance of the Company. The following are brief summaries of certain legal considerations relating to the current rights of stockholders of a Delaware corporation and the shareholders of a Texas corporation and the corporate governance of a company in Delaware and in Texas. The following discussion does not provide a complete description of the differences that may affect you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the TBOC and DGCL, the Delaware Charter and Delaware Bylaws, the Texas Charter and Texas Bylaws, and the body of case law in both jurisdictions, and some of the differences in the legal considerations below may not affect you in light of the provisions of the Texas Charter and Texas Bylaws, which opt in to certain determinations as permitted under the TBOC. ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; Increasing or Decreasing Authorized Capital Stock, Including Number of Unissued Shares of a Series of Preferred Stock &#8203; &#8203; The DGCL has no provision for increasing or decreasing authorized capital stock by unilateral board action without stockholder approval, although if the increase in the number of authorized shares is in connection with a forward stock split (up to an amount proportionate to the subdivision), no stockholder approval is required provided that the corporation only has one class of stock outstanding and such class is not divided into series (unless stockholder approval is expressly required by the certificate of incorporation). See &#8220;Charter Amendments&#8221; below. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, once stock has been issued, the board cannot unilaterally increase or decrease the authorized capital stock without shareholder approval, and there is no express exception for forward stock splits. With respect to a series of shares of preferred stock established by the board of directors if authorized by the corporation&#8217;s certificate of formation (and subject thereto), unless the certificate of formation expressly restricts the board of directors from increasing or decreasing the number of unissued shares of a series to be established by the board of directors, the board of directors may increase or decrease the number of shares in each series to be established, except that the board of directors may not decrease the number of shares in a particular series to a number that is less than the number of shares in that series that are issued at the time of the decrease. &#8203; Number of Directors &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, the number of directors shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the bylaws, unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors. If the certificate of incorporation fixes the &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, the number of directors shall be set by, or in the manner provided by, the certificate of formation or bylaws, except that the number of directors on the initial board of directors must be set by the &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; number of directors, then a change in the number of directors shall be made only by amendment of the certificate of incorporation. &#8203; &#8203; certificate of formation. The number of directors may be increased or decreased by amendment to, or as provided by, the certificate of formation or bylaws. If the certificate of formation or bylaws do not set the number constituting the board of directors or provide for the manner in which the number of directors must be determined, the number of directors is the same as the number constituting the initial board of directors as set by the certificate of formation. &#8203; Procedures for Filling Vacant Directorships &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws: (1)&#160;vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and (2)&#160;whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect 1 or more directors by the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected. In the case of a Delaware corporation the directors of which are divided into classes, any directors chosen by (1)&#160;or (2)&#160;of the above shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such directors shall have been chosen, and until their successors shall be elected and qualified. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, except as provided below with respect to class voting, vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by the election at an annual or special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose. The term of a director elected to fill a vacancy occurring in the board of directors is the unexpired term of the director&#8217;s predecessor in office. Except as provided below with respect to class voting, a directorship to be filled because of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the shareholders or by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of one or more directors by the shareholders. The board of directors may not fill more than two such directorships during the period between any two successive annual meetings of shareholders.

Unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise, if the board of directors of a Delaware corporation is classified (i.e., elected for staggered terms), a director may only be removed by stockholders for cause.

With respect to a matter other than the election of directors or a matter for which the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion of the shares entitled to vote is required by this code, the certificate of formation or bylaws of a corporation may provide that the act of the shareholders of the corporation is: (1)&#160;the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion, but not less than the majority, of the shares entitled to vote on that matter; (2)&#160;the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion, but not less than the majority, of the shares entitled to vote on that matter and represented in person or by proxy at a shareholders&#8217; meeting at which a quorum is present; (3)&#160;the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion, but not less than the majority, of the shares entitled to vote on, and who voted for or against, the matter at a shareholders&#8217; meeting at which a &#8203; &#160; 42 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; quorum is present; or (4)&#160;the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion, but not less than the majority, of the shares entitled to vote on, and who voted for, against, or expressly abstained with respect to, the matter at a shareholders&#8217; meeting at which a quorum is present. &#8203; Stockholder Vote for Fundamental Business Transactions &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon generally must approve fundamental changes, such as: (1)&#160;certain mergers or consolidations; (2)&#160;a sale, lease, or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation&#8217;s assets (provided that no stockholder authorization or consent is required (A)&#160;to mortgage or pledge the corporation&#8217;s property and assets unless the certificate of incorporation so requires or (B)&#160;where the property or assets in the sale, lease or exchange is collateral that secures a mortgage or is pledged to a secured party and certain additional conditions are met); (3)&#160;dissolution; (4)&#160;conversion of a domestic corporation to other entities; and (5)&#160;transfer, domestication or continuance of a domestic corporation to a foreign jurisdiction.

No such approval is required, however, if the assets being sold, leased or exchanged are not all or substantially all of the corporation&#8217;s assets.

If a Delaware corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation so provides, the Delaware corporation&#8217;s board of directors may also have the right to amend, repeal or adopt the bylaws. &#8203; &#8203; Generally, under the TBOC, the board of directors may amend, repeal or adopt a Texas corporation&#8217;s bylaws. However, (i)&#160;the shareholders may amend, repeal or adopt bylaws even if the directors also have that power and (ii)&#160;a Texas corporation&#8217;s certificate of formation may wholly or partly reserve the power to amend, repeal or adopt bylaws exclusively to the shareholders. Similarly, the shareholders, in amending, repealing or adopting a particular bylaw, may expressly provide that the board of directors may not amend, readopt or repeal that bylaw. &#8203; Dividends and Distributions &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation may, subject to any restrictions contained in its certificate of incorporation, pay dividends out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the current and/or the preceding fiscal year, unless the capital of the corporation is less than the capital represented by issued and outstanding stock having preferences on asset distributions. In addition, a Delaware corporation may not repurchase or redeem shares if doing so would render the corporation insolvent in the sense that it could not pay its debts as they come due or continue as a going concern. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a distribution is defined as a transfer of cash or other property (except a corporation&#8217;s own shares or rights to acquire its shares or a split-up or division of the issued shares of a class of a corporation into a larger number of shares within the same class that does not increase the stated capital of the corporation), or an issuance of debt, by a corporation to its shareholders in the form of: (i)&#160;a dividend on any class or series of a Texas corporation&#8217;s outstanding shares; (ii)&#160;a purchase or redemption, directly or indirectly, of its shares; or (iii)&#160;a payment in liquidation of all or a portion of its assets. Under the TBOC, a Texas corporation may not make a distribution if such distribution violates its certificate of formation, if the corporation&#8217;s surplus is less than the amount of the corporation&#8217;s stated capital (as determined by the TBOC) or, unless a Texas corporation is in receivership or the distribution is made in connection with the winding up and termination of the Texas corporation, if it either &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; renders a Texas corporation unable to pay its debts as they become due in the course of its business or affairs, or exceeds, depending on the type of distribution, either the net assets or the surplus of the Texas corporation, or, subject to certain exceptions, if the distribution will be made to shareholders of another class or series. &#8203; Stock Redemption and Repurchase &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation may purchase or redeem shares of any class except when its capital is impaired or would be impaired by such purchase or redemption. A Delaware corporation may, however, purchase or redeem out of capital, shares that are entitled upon any distribution of its assets to a preference over another class or series of its stock, or, if no shares entitled to such a preference are outstanding, any of its own shares, if such shares are to be retired and the capital reduced. However, a corporation may not purchase redeemable shares for a price greater than that at which they would be redeemed. In addition, a Delaware corporation may not effect a repurchase or redemption if doing so would render the corporation insolvent in the sense that it could not pay its debts as they come due or continue as a going concern. &#8203; &#8203; As noted above, under the TBOC, the purchase or redemption by a Texas corporation of its shares constitutes a distribution. Accordingly, the discussion above relating to distributions is applicable to stock redemptions and repurchases. &#8203; Ratification &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, there is a codified ratification process for defective corporate actions. The board of directors must adopt a resolution ratifying the defective corporate action and, if stockholder approval would have been required for the defective corporate action to have been taken, the defective corporate action must be submitted to stockholders for approval. In addition to the foregoing, under the DGCL, the corporation, any successor entity to the corporation, any director, or certain stockholders can apply to &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, there is a codified ratification process for defective corporate acts. The board of directors must adopt a resolution and then submit the ratified defective corporate act for shareholder approval (shareholder approval is subject to certain exceptions). In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board of directors of a Texas corporation that shares of the Texas corporation are valid shares or putative shares is conclusive, unless otherwise determined by a Texas district court or a Texas Business &#8203; &#160; 48 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; the Delaware Court for an order determining the validity and effectiveness of defective corporate acts, including without limitation to confirm whether a prior ratification was effective, whether a defective corporate act can be validated even if not previously ratified. In connection with such applications, the Delaware Court has broad discretion to fashion appropriate relief, including without limitation declaring ratifications effective, validating and declaring effective any defective corporate act, and making such other orders regarding such matters as it deems proper under the circumstances. &#8203; &#8203; Court. &#8203; Inspection of Books and Records &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, any stockholder may inspect, and make copies and extracts from, a Delaware corporation&#8217;s books and records during normal business hours for any proper purpose upon written demand under oath stating the purpose of the inspection. If a Delaware corporation refuses to permit inspection or does not reply to the demand within five business days after the demand has been made, the stockholder may apply to the Delaware Court for an order to compel such inspection. Generally, the stockholder bears the burden of showing that each category of requested records is essential to accomplishment of the stockholder&#8217;s stated purpose for the inspection. However, when a stockholder seeks to inspect a corporation&#8217;s list of stockholders or stock ledger, the burden of proof is on the corporation to establish that the inspection is for an improper purpose. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a shareholder may inspect a Texas corporation&#8217;s books and records during normal business hours upon written demand stating a proper purpose if such shareholder holds at least 5% of the outstanding shares of stock of the Texas corporation or has been a holder of shares for at least six&#160;months prior to such demand. If a Texas corporation refuses to allow a person to examine and make copies of account records, minutes, and share transfer records under the TBOC, the Texas corporation is liable to the shareholder for any cost or expense, including attorney&#8217;s fees, incurred in enforcing the shareholder&#8217;s rights under the TBOC. A Texas corporation may defend against an inspection action by establishing that the shareholder: (1)&#160;has sold or offered for sale, or has aided or abetted a person in procuring a list of shareholders or of holders of voting trust certificates for the purpose of selling, a list of shareholders or of holders of voting trust certificates for shares of the Texas corporation or any other corporation within the two&#160;years preceding the date the action is brought; (2)&#160;has improperly used information obtained through prior examination of the books, account &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 49 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; records, minutes, or share transfer records of the corporation or any other corporation; or (3)&#160;was not acting in good faith or for a proper purpose in making the request. &#8203; Insurance &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation is allowed to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person&#8217;s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the DGCL. The DGCL does not prohibit a Delaware corporation from establishing and maintaining arrangements, other than insurance, to protect such persons, including a trust fund or surety arrangement. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a Texas enterprise is allowed to purchase or procure or establish and maintain insurance or another arrangement to indemnify or hold harmless an existing or former governing person, delegate, officer, employee, or agent against any liability: (1)&#160;asserted against and incurred by the person in that capacity or (2)&#160;arising out of the person&#8217;s status in that capacity. The insurance or other arrangement established may insure or indemnify against the liability described above without regard to whether the enterprise otherwise would have had the power to indemnify the person against that liability under the TBOC. Under the TBOC, for the benefit of persons to be indemnified by the enterprise, an enterprise may, in addition to purchasing or procuring or establishing and maintaining insurance or another arrangement: (1)&#160;create a trust fund; (2)&#160;establish any form of self-insurance, including a contract to indemnify; (3)&#160;secure the enterprise&#8217;s indemnity obligation by grant of a security interest or other lien on the assets of the enterprise; or (4)&#160;establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or surety arrangement. &#8203; Interested Party Transaction Approvals &#8203; &#8203; The DGCL provides that certain interested party transactions are not void or voidable solely because the transaction is between a corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the corporation and an entity in which one or more of its directors or officers has a financial interest, or solely because the interested director or officer was present at or participated in the meeting in which the interested transaction was approved if any of the following conditions are satisfied: (1)&#160;the material facts as to the &#8203; &#8203; The TBOC provides that an otherwise valid and enforceable contract or transaction between a corporation and (1)&#160;one or more directors or officers, or one or more affiliates or associates of one or more directors or officers, of the corporation; or (2)&#160;an entity or other organization in which one or more directors or officers, or one or more affiliates or associates of one or more directors or officers, of the corporation: (A)&#160;is a managerial official; or (B)&#160;has a financial interest is valid and enforceable, and is not void or voidable, notwithstanding such &#8203; &#160; 50 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; director&#8217;s or officer&#8217;s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; (2)&#160;the material facts as to the director&#8217;s or officer&#8217;s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3)&#160;the contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee or the stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; relationship or interest if any one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1)&#160;the material facts as to the applicable relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed to or known by: (A)&#160;the corporation&#8217;s board of directors or a committee of the board of directors, and the board of directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the approval of the majority of the disinterested directors or committee members, regardless of whether the disinterested directors or committee members constitute a quorum; or (B)&#160;the shareholders entitled to vote on the authorization of the contract or transaction, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by a vote of the shareholders; or (2)&#160;the contract or transaction is fair to the corporation when the contract or transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified by the board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, or the shareholders. The TBOC differs from the DGCL&#8217;s interested party transaction statute in that it expressly provides that if at least one of the above conditions is satisfied, neither the corporation nor any of the corporation&#8217;s shareholders will have a cause of action against any of the corporation&#8217;s directors or officers for breach of duty with respect to the making, authorization, or performance of the contract or transaction because the person had an applicable relationship or interest. &#8203; Limitation of Liability of Stockholders &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides, the stockholders of a corporation shall not be personally liable for the payment of the corporation&#8217;s debts except as they may be liable by reason of their own conduct or acts. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, subject to certain exceptions, a shareholder&#8217;s liability is limited to its contributed capital. &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; Limitation of Personal Liability of Directors and Officers &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation is permitted to adopt a provision in its certificate of incorporation eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director or officer to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, provided that such provision does not eliminate or limit the liability of: (i)&#160;a director or officer breaching the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii)&#160;a director or officer failing to act in good faith, engaging in intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii)&#160;a director declaring an illegal dividend or approving an illegal stock purchase or redemption; (iv)&#160;a director or officer obtaining an improper personal benefit from the corporation; or (v)&#160;an officer in any action by or in the right of a Delaware corporation. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a Texas corporation is permitted to provide that a director is not liable, or is liable only to the extent provided by the certificate of formation, to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for an act or omission by the person in the person&#8217;s capacity as a director. The TBOC does not, however, permit any limitation of the liability of a director for: (i)&#160;a breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders; (ii)&#160;an act or omission not in good faith that constitutes a breach of duty of the person to the corporation or involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii)&#160;a transaction from which the director obtains an improper benefit, regardless of whether the benefit resulted from an action taken within the scope of the person&#8217;s duties; or (iv)&#160;an act or omission for which the liability of a director is expressly provided by an applicable statute (such as wrongful distributions). &#8203; Considerations by Directors Permitted by Statute &#8203; &#8203; Except for corporations that have opted to become public benefit corporations, directors of Delaware corporations do not have any express statutory authority to consider other constituencies. Delaware case law provides that fiduciary duties in most circumstances require directors to seek to maximize the value of the corporation for the long-term benefit of the stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, in discharging the duties of director under the TBOC or otherwise and in considering the best interests of the corporation, a director is entitled to consider the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation and the shareholders of the corporation, including the possibility that those interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation. In discharging the duties of a director or officer under the TBOC or otherwise, a director or officer of a corporation is entitled to consider any social purpose specified in the corporation&#8217;s certificate of formation. In addition, the TBOC provides that nothing in the applicable section thereof prohibits or limits a director or officer of a corporation that does not have a social purpose specified as a purpose in the corporation&#8217;s certificate of formation from considering, approving, or taking an action that promotes or has the effect &#8203; &#160; 52 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; of promoting a social, charitable, or environmental purpose. Texas also has a public benefit corporation statute. &#8203; Business Opportunities &#8203; &#8203; Under Delaware law, the corporate opportunity doctrine holds that a corporate officer or director may not generally and unilaterally take a business opportunity for his or her own. Factors to be considered include: (i)&#160;whether the corporation is financially able to exploit the opportunity; (ii)&#160;if the opportunity is within the corporation&#8217;s line of business; (iii)&#160;whether the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity; and (iv)&#160;whether by taking the opportunity for his or her own, the corporate fiduciary will thereby be placed in a position inimical to his duties to the corporation. The DGCL permits a Delaware corporation to renounce, in its certificate of incorporation or by action of the board of directors, any interest or expectancy of the corporation in, or being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or specified classes or categories of business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or one or more of its officers, directors or stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; Texas law generally follows the Delaware corporate opportunity doctrine. The TBOC permits a Texas entity to renounce, in its certificate of formation or by action of its board of directors, an interest or expectancy of the entity in, or an interest or expectancy of the entity in being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or a specified class or category of business opportunities presented to the entity or one or more of its managerial officials or owners. &#8203; Indemnification of Directors and Officers &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation is permitted to indemnify any person who is a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, other than an action by or in the right of the corporation, to which such director, officer, employee or agent &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a Texas corporation is permitted to indemnify a director, former director, or delegate who was, is, or is threatened to be made a respondent in a proceeding, against (i)&#160;judgments and (ii)&#160;expenses (other than a judgment) reasonably and actually incurred by the person in connection with a proceeding if the person: (a)&#160;acted in good faith; (b)&#160;reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in the person&#8217;s official capacity, that the person&#8217;s conduct was in the corporation&#8217;s best interests, and in any other case, that the person&#8217;s conduct was not opposed to the corporation&#8217;s best interests; and (c)&#160;in the case of a criminal &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; may be a party or threatened to be made a party, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed was in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and in the case of a criminal proceeding, that he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. In connection with any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the corporation involving a person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, a Delaware corporation has the power to indemnify such a person who is a party or is threatened to be made a party for expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit: (i)&#160;if such person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and (ii)&#160;if such person is found liable to the corporation, only to the extent the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought determined that in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. This is not exclusive of any other indemnification rights, which may be granted by a Delaware corporation to its directors, officers, employees or agents. &#8203; &#8203; proceeding, did not have a reasonable cause to believe the person&#8217;s conduct was unlawful. In addition, the TBOC permits indemnification of other persons as described in the section entitled &#8220;Persons Covered&#8221; below. If, however, the person is found liable to a Texas corporation, or is found liable on the basis he or she received an improper personal benefit, then indemnification under the TBOC is limited to the reimbursement of reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with the proceeding, and which excludes a judgment, a penalty, a fine, and an excise or similar tax, including an excise tax assessed against the person with respect to an employee benefit plan. Furthermore, no indemnification will be available if the person is found liable for: (i)&#160;willful or intentional misconduct in the performance of the person&#8217;s duty to the corporation; (ii)&#160;breach of the person&#8217;s duty of loyalty owed to the corporation; or (iii)&#160;an act or omission not committed in good faith that constitutes a breach of a duty owed by the person to the corporation. &#8203; Advancement of Expenses &#8203; &#8203; Expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) incurred by an officer or director of the corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the &#8203; &#8203; A corporation may pay or reimburse reasonable expenses incurred by a present director or officer who was, is, or is threatened to be made a respondent in a proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the &#8203; &#160; 54 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section. &#8203; &#8203; proceeding without making the determinations required for permissive indemnification after the corporation receives: (1)&#8194;a written affirmation by the person of the person&#8217;s good faith belief that the person has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification; &#8201;and (2)&#8194;a written undertaking by or on behalf of the person to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if the final determination is that the person has not met that standard or that indemnification is prohibited by the TBOC. &#8203; Procedure for Indemnification &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a determination that indemnification of a director or officer is appropriate generally must be made: (i)&#160;by a majority vote of directors who are not party to the proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (ii)&#160;by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; (iii)&#160;if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (iv)&#160;by stockholder vote. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a determination that indemnification is appropriate generally must be made: (i)&#160;by a majority vote of the directors who, at the time of the vote, are disinterested and independent, regardless of whether such directors constitute a quorum; (ii)&#160;by a majority vote of a special committee of the board of directors if the committee is designated by a majority vote of the directors who at the time of the vote are disinterested and independent, regardless of whether such directors constitute a quorum, and is composed solely of one or more directors who are disinterested and independent; (iii)&#160;by special legal counsel selected by majority vote under (i)&#160;or (ii)&#160;above; (iv)&#160;by the shareholders in a vote that excludes those shares held by directors who, at the time of the vote, are not disinterested and independent; or (v)&#160;by a unanimous vote of the shareholders of the corporation. &#8203; Mandatory Indemnification &#8203; &#8203; The DGCL requires indemnification for expenses (including attorneys&#8217; fees) actually and reasonably incurred with respect to any claim, issue or matter on which the director or officer is successful on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of the proceeding. &#8203; &#8203; The TBOC requires indemnification for reasonable expenses actually incurred only if the director is wholly successful on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of the proceeding. &#8203; Persons Covered &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, directors and officers, but not employees and agents, are entitled to mandatory indemnification for expenses incurred &#8203; &#8203; The TBOC generally provides that a corporation may indemnify and advance expenses to a person who is not a director, including an officer, &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ISSUE &#8203; &#8203; DELAWARE &#8203; &#8203; TEXAS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; when successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of litigation. Other than in that instance, the DGCL provides the same indemnification rights to officers, employees and agents that it provides for directors. &#8203; &#8203; employee or agent, as provided by: (1)&#160;the corporation&#8217;s governing documents; (2)&#160;general or specific action of the corporation&#8217;s board of directors; (3)&#160;resolution of the shareholders; (4)&#160;contract; or (5)&#160;common law. A corporation must indemnify an officer to the same extent that indemnification is required under the TBOC for a director. A determination of indemnification for a person who is not a director of a corporation, including an officer, employee, or agent, is not required to be made in accordance with the procedures set out in the relevant sections of the TBOC. &#8203; Rights Plans &#8203; &#8203; Delaware has no statutory authorization for stockholder rights plans. Adoption of stockholder rights plans is viewed as a defensive action and is subject to enhanced scrutiny by the Delaware courts, with the burden initially on the board of directors to demonstrate that the adoption of the rights plan is reasonable in response to a reasonably identified threat posed. &#8203; &#8203; Texas case law has generally upheld shareholder rights plans, but indicates that rights plans will be scrutinized for validity at the time of adoption and for continued validity in the face of changing circumstances. In addition, the TBOC expressly permits directors to look to the &#8220;long-term&#8221; benefit to shareholders in taking action. &#8203; Selection of Forum &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation or bylaws may require, consistent with applicable jurisdictional requirements, that any or all internal corporate claims shall be brought solely and exclusively in any or all of the courts in Delaware, and no provision of a Delaware corporation&#8217;s certificate of incorporation or bylaws may prohibit bringing such claims in the courts of Delaware. &#8220;Internal corporate claims&#8221; means claims, including claims in the right of the corporation, (i)&#160;that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity; or (ii)&#160;as to which this title confers jurisdiction upon the Delaware Court. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, the governing documents of a Texas entity may require, consistent with applicable state and federal jurisdictional requirements, that any internal entity claims shall be brought only in a court in Texas. &#8220;Internal entity claim&#8221; means a claim of any nature, including a derivative claim in the right of an entity, that is based on, arises from, or relates to the internal affairs of the entity. Internal affairs include the rights, powers, and duties of the entity&#8217;s governing persons, officers, owners, and members, and matters relating to the entity&#8217;s membership or ownership interests. &#8203; Pre-Suit Demand in Derivative Suits &#8203; &#8203; Under Delaware court rules and case law, in order for a stockholder to commence a derivative action on behalf of the corporation, the &#8203; &#8203; Texas is a universal demand jurisdiction.

Demand will be deemed futile if at least half the members of the board: (1)&#160;received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that is the subject of the litigation demand; (2)&#160;faces a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that would be the subject of the litigation demand; and (3)&#160;lacks independence from someone who received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct that would be the subject of the litigation demand or who would face a substantial likelihood of liability on any of the claims that are the subject of the litigation demand. &#8203; &#8203; futility. A shareholder may not institute a derivative proceeding until the 91st day after the date a written demand is filed with the corporation stating with particularity the act, omission, or other matter that is the subject of the claim or challenge and requesting that the corporation take suitable action. The foregoing waiting period is not required or, if applicable, shall terminate if: (1)&#160;the shareholder has been notified that the demand has been rejected by the corporation; (2)&#160;the corporation is suffering irreparable injury; or (3)&#160;irreparable injury to the corporation would result by waiting for the expiration of the 90-day period. &#8203; Stock Ownership Requirement for Derivative Suits; Jury Trials &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, subject to limited exceptions, a stockholder may not institute or maintain a derivative suit unless the plaintiff was a stockholder of the corporation at the time of the transaction of which such stockholder complains or that such stockholder&#8217;s stock thereafter devolved upon such stockholder by operation of law. Jury trials are generally not available in the Delaware Court, which is the Court in which stockholder suits relating to the internal affairs of a Delaware corporation must be filed. &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, a shareholder may not institute or maintain a derivative proceeding unless: (1)&#160;the shareholder was a shareholder of the corporation at the time of the transaction in question, or became a shareholder by operation of law originating from a person that was a shareholder at the time of the transaction in question; and (2)&#160;the shareholder fairly and adequately represents the interests of the corporation in enforcing the right of the corporation. Under Texas law, in civil cases, a party generally has a right to a jury trial to determine questions of fact if the party timely demands a jury and pays the jury fee. &#8203; Dissent and Appraisal Rights &#8203; &#8203; Under the DGCL, a stockholder of a corporation that is a constituent in a merger, consolidation, conversion, domestication, transfer, or continuance may, under certain circumstances, be entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to which the stockholder may receive cash in the amount of the fair market value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court. Under the DGCL, stockholders have no appraisal rights in the event of a merger, consolidation, conversion, &#8203; &#8203; Under the TBOC, except for the limited classes of mergers, consolidations, sales and asset dispositions for which no shareholder approval is required under Texas law, shareholders of Texas corporations with voting rights have dissenters&#8217; rights in the event of a merger, consolidation, interest exchange, conversion, sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all, or substantially all, the property and assets of the corporation.

Under the TBOC, an owner of an ownership interest in a Texas domestic entity subject to dissenters&#8217; rights is entitled to dissent from an amendment to a Texas for-profit corporation&#8217;s certificate of formation to add required provisions to elect to be a public benefit corporation or delete required provisions, which in effect cancels the corporation&#8217;s election to be a public benefit corporation if the owner owns shares that were entitled to vote on the amendment; except if the shares held by the owner are part of a class or series of shares listed on a national securities exchange; or held of record by at least 2,000 owners. &#8203; Franchise Tax Savings and Filing Fees The Company&#8217;s current status as a Delaware corporation physically located in Texas requires the Company to comply with franchise tax obligations in both Delaware and Texas. For the most recent franchise tax period, the Company paid approximately $250,000 in franchise taxes to the state of Delaware, which will no longer be required to be paid if the Texas Redomestication is completed. The Company&#8217;s Texas tax obligations will not change as a result of the Texas Redomestication, except potentially with respect to the calculation of gross income with respect to any future repurchases of the Company&#8217;s debt at a discount. Accordingly, the Texas Redomestication will result in a net savings by the Company of approximately $250,000 annually. The annual filing fees to qualify as a foreign jurisdiction in either jurisdiction are immaterial, and there are certain immaterial fees associated with effecting the Texas Redomestication via conversion. What Doesn&#8217;t Change After Texas Redomestication? Apart from being governed by the Texas Charter, Texas Bylaws and the TBOC, following completion of the Texas Redomestication, the Company will continue to exist in the form of a Texas corporation and cease to exist as a Delaware corporation. By virtue of the Texas Redomestication, the Texas Corporation will be a continuation of the Delaware Corporation and all of the rights, privileges, and powers of the Delaware Corporation, and all property, real, personal, and mixed, and all debts due to the Delaware Corporation, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to the Delaware Corporation, will remain vested in the Texas Corporation and will be the property of the Texas Corporation, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in the Delaware Corporation will not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Texas Redomestication, but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of the Delaware Corporation will be preserved unimpaired. In addition, all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Delaware Corporation will remain attached to the Texas Corporation and may be enforced against the Texas Corporation to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it in its capacity as the Texas Corporation. The rights, privileges, powers and interest in property of the Delaware Corporation, as well as the debts, liabilities and duties of the Delaware Corporation, will not be deemed, as a consequence of the Texas Redomestication, to have been transferred to the Texas Corporation for any purpose of the laws of the State of Delaware. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The conversion of the Delaware Corporation into the Texas Corporation and the resulting cessation of the Company&#8217;s existence as a corporation of Delaware will not affect any obligations or liabilities of the Company incurred prior to the conversion or the personal liability of any person incurred prior to the conversion, nor will it affect the choice of law applicable to the Company with respect to matters arising prior to the conversion. No Change in Business, Jobs or Physical Location The Texas Redomestication will not result in any change in business, jobs, management, properties, location of any of our offices or facilities, number of employees, obligations, assets, liabilities or net worth (other than as a result of the costs related to the Texas Redomestication). We intend to maintain our corporate headquarters in Texas. Our management, including all directors and officers, will remain the same in connection with the Texas Redomestication and will have identical positions with the Texas Corporation. To the extent that the Texas Redomestication will require the consent or waiver of a third party, the Company will use commercially reasonable effects to obtain such consent or waiver before completing the Texas Redomestication. The Company does not expect that any such required consent will impede its ability to redomesticate to Texas. The Texas Redomestication will not otherwise adversely affect any of the Company&#8217;s material contracts with any third parties and the Company&#8217;s rights and obligations under such material contractual arrangements will continue as rights and obligations of the Texas Corporation. No Securities Act Consequences We will continue to be a publicly held company following completion of the Texas Redomestication, and our common stock will continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and traded under the symbol &#8220;TSLA.&#8221; We will continue to file required periodic reports and other documents with the SEC. We do not expect there to be any interruption in the trading of our common stock as a result of the Texas Redomestication. We and our shareholders will be in the same respective positions under the federal securities laws after the Texas Redomestication as we and our stockholders were prior to the Texas Redomestication. No Material Accounting Implications Effecting the Texas Redomestication will not have any material adverse accounting implications. No Exchange of Stock Certificates Required Stockholders will not have to exchange their existing stock certificates for new stock certificates. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Delaware Corporation Common Stock will automatically be converted into one share of Texas Corporation Common Stock, and your stock certificates will represent the same number of shares of the Texas Corporation as they represented of the Delaware Corporation. If you hold physical stock certificates, you do not have to exchange your existing stock certificates of the Company for stock certificates of the Texas Corporation; however, after the Texas Redomestication, any shareholder desiring a new stock certificate may submit the existing stock certificate to Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Company&#8217;s transfer agent, for cancellation and obtain a new certificate by contacting Computershare Trust Company, N.A. at 800-662-7232. All of the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Company&#8217;s equity compensation plans will be obligations of the Texas Corporation. Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Delaware Corporation Common Stock under these plans will be converted into an option to purchase an equal number of shares of the Texas Corporation Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Texas Redomestication. Each other stock award will be converted to an equivalent award with the same terms issued by the Texas Corporation. Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences We believe that for federal income tax purposes no gain or loss will be recognized by the Company, the Texas Corporation, or the stockholders of the Company who receive the Texas Corporation &#160; 60 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Common Stock for their Delaware Corporation Common Stock in connection with the Texas Redomestication. The aggregate tax basis of the Texas Corporation Common Stock received by a stockholder of the Company as a result of the Texas Redomestication will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Delaware Corporation Common Stock converted into that Texas Corporation Common Stock held by that stockholder as a capital asset at the time of the Texas Redomestication. Each stockholder&#8217;s holding period of the Texas Corporation Common Stock received in the Texas Redomestication will include the holding period of the common stock converted into that Texas Corporation Common Stock, provided the shares are held by such stockholder as a capital asset at the time of the Texas Redomestication. This Proxy Statement only discusses U.S. federal income tax consequences and has done so only for general information. It does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular stockholders based upon individual circumstances or to stockholders who are subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, stockholders who hold their stock through a partnership or as part of a straddle or other derivative arrangement, foreign holders or holders who acquired their shares as compensation, whether through employee stock options or otherwise. This Proxy Statement does not address the tax consequences under state, local or foreign laws. State, local or foreign income tax consequences to stockholders may vary from the federal income tax consequences described above, and stockholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the consequences to them of the Texas Redomestication under all applicable tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220; Tax Code &#8221;), applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial authority and administrative rulings and practice, all in effect as of the date of this Proxy Statement, all of which are subject to differing interpretations and change, possibly with retroactive effect. The Company has neither requested nor received a tax opinion from legal counsel or rulings from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the consequences of the Reincorporation. There can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions would not alter the consequences discussed above. You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the particular tax consequences to you of the Texas Redomestication, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws. Additional Information Regulatory Matters In connection with the Texas Redomestication, the Company intends to make filings with the Secretary of State of Texas and the Secretary of State of Delaware, and does not anticipate making any other filings to effect the Texas Redomestication. Nonetheless, we may face legal challenges to the Texas Redomestication, including, among others, stockholder challenges under Delaware law, arising from the Texas Redomestication. No Appraisal Rights Under the DGCL, holders of our common stock are not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to the Texas Redomestication described in this proposal. We have no holders of preferred stock. Interest of Certain Persons The Special Committee has found that the corporate laws of the state of Delaware and the state of Texas are substantially equivalent, at least on net (i.e., balancing relevant considerations against one another) and as relevant to the Company. As described in the Special Committee Report, the Special Committee expressly considered whether incorporating in Texas would convey any non-ratable benefits on any of Tesla&#8217;s directors or officers, including Mr. Musk. Its process did not identify any such non-ratable benefits. However, others may allege, and stockholders should be aware in voting on the Texas Redomestication Proposal, that our directors and executive officers may be considered to have interests in the transaction that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the stockholders generally. The Special Committee and the Board have considered &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; these interests, among other matters, in reaching the Special Committee&#8217;s decision to recommend the Texas Redomestication and the Board&#8217;s decision to approve the Texas Redomestication and to recommend that our stockholders vote in favor of this proposal. While the Texas Redomestication itself will have no impact on the outcome of Proposal Four, nor is it expected to directly impact the compensation of any of our directors or executive officers, Mr.&#160;Musk has publicly expressed his personal view in support of the Texas Redomestication. In addition, it may be alleged that Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk may have an interest in the Texas Redomestication by virtue of future decisions about compensation and the fact that such compensation decisions would be governed by Texas law. Further, it may be alleged that the independent directors of the Board (other than Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson) have personal or business relationships with Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk such that they are not disinterested in all respects due to such relationships with Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk and the interest of Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk in the Texas Redomestication. The Company cautions that such allegations have been made in the past and may be made in connection with this proposal, and cautions stockholders to take such allegations into account in deciding how to vote on the Texas Redomestication Proposal. Disclosure of Committee Advisors In order to assist the Special Committee in its work, the Special Committee retained multiple advisors. After the Special Committee conducted interviews with multiple law firms, the Special Committee retained Sidley as its legal counsel. The Special Committee also determined that it would benefit from being advised by Delaware counsel, a corporate law and governance expert and an investment bank. For each role, Sidley assessed multiple leading candidates, with a focus on both quality and independence. Sidley recommended and the Special Committee retained the following additional advisors: (i)&#160;Abrams &amp; Bayliss LLP, as Delaware counsel, (ii)&#160;Professor Anthony Casey of the University of Chicago Law School, as corporate law and governance expert and (iii)&#160;Houlihan as its financial advisor. The Special Committee determined that each of its advisors is independent. For additional information, see the Special Committee Report. Conclusion After careful review of all of the factors, taken together, the Special Committee and the Board believe that the Texas Redomestication is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, and the Board recommends that stockholders vote &#8220;FOR&#8221; the Texas Redomestication. Effect of Not Obtaining the Required Vote for Approval If the Texas Redomestication Proposal fails to obtain the requisite vote for approval, the Texas Redomestication will not be consummated, and the Company&#8217;s domicile will be unchanged by this vote. Required Vote We ask our stockholders to approve the Texas Redomestication and the adoption of the Texas Redomestication Resolution. This proposal to approve the Texas Redomestication and the adoption of the Texas Redomestication Resolution requires the following votes of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders: (1) the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of Tesla entitled to vote thereon (the &#8220; Conversion Standard &#8221;), &#8203; and (2) in addition to the Statutory Standard, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Tesla stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon (the &#8220; Conversion Disinterested Standard &#8221;). &#8203; &#160; 62 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; With respect to approval of the Texas Redomestication and the adoption of the Texas Redomestication Resolution, you may vote &#8220;FOR&#8221;, &#8220;AGAINST&#8221; or &#8220;ABSTAIN.&#8221; Abstentions will only be counted toward the tabulations of voting power present and entitled to vote on the Texas Redomestication proposal for the Conversion Disinterested Standard and will have the same effect as votes against the proposal for both the Conversion Standard and the Conversion Disinterested Standard. Brokers do not have discretion to vote on the proposal to approve the Texas Redomestication. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the proposal for purposes of the Conversion Standard and will have no effect on the Conversion Disinterested Standard. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board (with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves) recommends that stockholders vote FOR the approval of the redomestication of Tesla from Delaware to Texas by conversion and the adoption of the Texas redomestication resolution and plan of conversion. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Proposal Four Tesla Proposal to Ratify the 100% Performance-Based Stock Option Award to Elon Musk That Was Proposed to and Approved By Our Stockholders in 2018 Following the recommendations of the Special Committee, the Board, with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves, has determined to seek ratification by stockholders of the 2018 CEO Performance Award (such ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, whether under common law or under Section&#160;204 of the DGCL, the &#8220; Ratification &#8221;), and determined that the Ratification is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and recommends that our stockholders vote to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The Ratification is being sought for any purpose permitted under Delaware law, including but not limited to Delaware common law and Delaware statutory provisions such as Section&#160;204 of the DGCL. For purposes of your consideration of the Ratification, you should consider all of the facts disclosed in this proposal as pertinent to your vote on Ratification, including but not limited to the conclusions reached by the Delaware Court described herein. Principal Terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award To Be Ratified Under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which is attached as Annex H , Mr.&#160;Musk was entitled to receive no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that would vest simply by the passage of time, all of which are standard methods for compensating executives of U.S. public companies. Instead, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s only opportunity to be compensated for his effort, dedication and achievements on behalf of Tesla was a 100% at-risk performance award, consisting exclusively of stock options with tranches that would vest only if certain specified milestones were met, each of which required Tesla to achieve both a market capitalization milestone and an operational milestone, as described below. Additionally, Mr.&#160;Musk was required to hold shares that he acquired upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for a period of five&#160;years after he exercised the underlying options&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not just for a five year period after such options vested. &#8226; For the first tranche, Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization was required to increase to $100&#160;billion and the Company needed to meet an additional operational milestone. Each subsequent tranche required not only that Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization increase by additional $50&#160;billion increments&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;up to a total of $650&#160;billion&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;(each, a &#8220; Market Capitalization Milestone &#8221;) but also that Tesla was required to achieve a series of previously unmet operational milestones (each, an &#8220; Operational Milestone &#8221;). &#8203; &#8226; The 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of a 10-year grant of stock options with 12 potential vesting tranches, and was designed to help drive Tesla towards exceptional execution on both a top-line and bottom-line basis. &#8203; &#160; 64 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8226; For each tranche in which both milestones were achieved under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr.&#160;Musk would vest in a number of stock options that corresponded to approximately 1% of Tesla&#8217;s total outstanding shares of common stock, based on the shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock outstanding at the time of the approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The 2018 CEO Performance Award was intended to further align Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s incentives with stockholder returns by requiring that Mr.&#160;Musk continue to hold any shares acquired through exercise of the stock options for a further five&#160;years after the option is exercised (not just for a five year period after the option vested), meaning that Mr.&#160;Musk was not only incentivized to achieve remarkable results to earn his incentive awards but he was also incentivized to continue to improve those results to ultimately realize value from these awards. &#8203; The following table provides details regarding how the 2018 CEO Performance Award would vest over the 12 tranches and the milestone requirements for each tranche to vest. Overview of the 2018 CEO Performance Award Below is an overview of the 2018 CEO Performance Award as it was adopted in 2018. Where appropriate, the discussion below provides updated information regarding share numbers and dates, in particular in light of intervening stock splits and Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s achievement of the Market Capitalization Milestones and Operational Milestones. See Annex H for a copy of the 2018 CEO Performance Award agreement. In addition, see &#8220; Compensation Discussion &amp; Analysis &#8221; elsewhere in this Proxy Statement for additional information. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Award Terms &#8203; &#8203; Details &#8203; 2018 CEO Performance Award Value &#8203; &#8203; Total size: 12% of total outstanding shares of our common stock as of January&#160;19, 2018, the last trading day prior to the grant date of January&#160;21, 2018 (approximately 20.3&#160;million option shares equivalent to 303,960,630 shares of our common stock today after giving effect to stock splits). Number of Vesting Tranches: 12 tranches; 1% of total outstanding shares of our common stock as of January&#160;19, 2018 per tranche. The present intrinsic value of the 2018 CEO Performance Award is $44.9 billion (based on the closing price of Tesla common stock on April 12, 2024). &#8203; Equity Type &#8203; &#8203; Nonqualified stock options. &#8203; Exercise Price &#8203; &#8203; Fair Market Value (FMV) of Tesla common stock on the grant date of January&#160;21, 2018, which was $350.02 per share of our common stock (based on the closing price on January&#160;19, 2018, the last trading day prior to the grant date). Equivalent to $23.34 per share of our common stock today after giving effect to stock splits. &#8203; Award Vesting / Milestones &#8203; &#8203; Market Capitalization Milestones a. 12 Market Capitalization Milestones. &#8203; b. First tranche milestone was a market capitalization of $100&#160;billion (representing an increase of approximately $40.9 billion over the Company&#8217;s market capitalization of approximately $59.1 billion on January&#160;19, 2018); each tranche thereafter required an additional $50&#160;billion in market capitalization for such tranche to vest, up to $650&#160;billion market capitalization for the last tranche. &#8203; c. Sustained market capitalization was required for each Market Capitalization Milestone to be met, other than in a change in control situation. Specifically, there were two prongs that needed to be met to achieve a given Market Capitalization Milestone: &#8203; &#8226; Six-calendar-month trailing average (based on trading days); and &#8203; &#8226; 30 calendar day trailing average (based on trading days). &#8203; Operational Milestones a. 16 Operational Milestones, of which at least 12 of which may be paired with Market Capitalization Milestones for all tranches to vest. &#8203; b.

Vesting Each of the 12 tranches vested only when both a Market Capitalization Milestone and an Operational Milestone were certified by the Board as having been met. Any one of the 16 Operational Milestones could be matched with any one of the 12 Market Capitalization Milestones, but any single Operational Milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement for one tranche. A Market Capitalization Milestone and an Operational Milestone that were matched together could be achieved at different points in time and vesting would occur at the later of the achievement certification dates for such Market Capitalization Milestone and Operational Milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of a tranche. &#8203; &#8203; Term of 2018 CEO Performance Award &#8203; &#8203; Ten&#160;years. &#8203; &#8203; Post-Termination of Employment Exercise Period &#8203; &#8203; One year. &#8203; &#8203; Post-Exercise Holding Period &#8203; &#8203; Five&#160;years following the exercise (not vesting) of the stock options, to further align Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s interests with Tesla stockholders&#8217; interests following option exercise. &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8203; Employment Requirement For Continued Vesting &#8203; &#8203; Vesting eligibility contingent upon being: 1.

Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer. &#8203; Extended exercise period : If Mr.&#160;Musk was still employed at Tesla in a role other than the specified roles above, he would have no longer been able to vest under the 2018 CEO Performance Award but, for so long as Mr.&#160;Musk continued as an employee of Tesla, any vested and unexercised portion of the option may be exercised for the full term of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. &#8203; &#8203; Termination of Employment &#8203; &#8203; No acceleration of vesting upon termination of employment, death or disability. &#8203; &#8203; Change in Control of Tesla &#8203; &#8203; No automatic acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of Tesla, but in a change in control situation the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the Market Capitalization Milestones, measured at the time of such change in control without regard to the six-calendar-month and 30-calendar-day trailing averages of Tesla&#8217;s stock price. In other words, upon a change in control where Tesla was acquired, vesting of milestones under the 2018 CEO Performance Award would not have required the achievement of a matching Operational Milestone. The treatment of the 2018 CEO Performance Award upon a change in control was intended to align Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s interests with Tesla&#8217;s other stockholders with respect to evaluating potential takeover offers. &#8203; &#8203; Exercise Methods / Requirements &#8203; &#8203; Exercise Methods: 1. Cashless: sufficient shares to cover exercise prices and taxes are simultaneously sold upon exercise of options; and &#8203; 2. Cash: exercise price is paid in cash upon exercise of options. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Clawback &#8203; &#8203; Vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance Award subject to a clawback in the event financial statements are restated in a way that a tranche would not have otherwise vested. &#8203; &#8203; Market Capitalization and Operational Milestone Adjustments &#8203; &#8203; Market Capitalization and Operational Milestone targets would be adjusted higher to account for acquisition activity that could be considered material to the achievement of the milestones. Market Capitalization and Operational Milestone targets would be adjusted lower to account for split-up, spin-off or divestiture activity that could be considered material to the achievement of the milestones. &#8203; &#160; 68 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Material Terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award 2018 CEO Performance Award Value .&#160;&#160;&#160;The total number of shares of Tesla common stock underlying the 2018 CEO Performance Award was 20,264,042 (equivalent to 303,960,630 shares of our common stock today after giving effect to stock splits), divided equally among 12 separate tranches of options to purchase approximately 1.69&#160;million shares of our common stock per tranche (equivalent to 25.33 million shares of our common stock today after giving effect to stock splits). The number of shares of our common stock underlying the 2018 CEO Performance Award in each tranche was equivalent to 1% of the 168,867,016 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock outstanding as of January&#160;19, 2018 (equivalent to 25.33 million shares of our common stock today after giving effect to stock splits) and, therefore, the total number of shares underlying the 2018 CEO Performance Award was equivalent to 12% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of such date (equivalent to approximately 9.5% of the 3,188,965,775 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock outstanding at March 31, 2024). Equity Type .&#160;&#160;&#160;The 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of performance-based nonqualified stock options. Mr.&#160;Musk was entitled to receive compensation from the 2018 CEO Performance Award only to the extent that Tesla achieved the applicable performance milestones. Exercise Price .&#160;&#160;&#160;The exercise price of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was initially set at $350.02 per share, which was the closing market price of Tesla&#8217;s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on January&#160;19, 2018, the last trading day prior to the grant date of January&#160;21, 2018 (which was not a trading day). After giving effect to stock splits since the date of the initial grant, the exercise price of each of the options issuable under the 2018 CEO Performance Award is now $23.34. Award Vesting / Milestones .&#160;&#160;&#160;Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would vest upon certification by the Board that each of (a)&#160;the Market Capitalization Milestone for such tranche and (b)&#160;an Operational Milestone had been met. Any single Operational Milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement for one tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, together with the corresponding Market Capitalization milestone. &#8226; There were 12 Market Capitalization Milestones, each of which required an incremental increase in Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization, initially to $100&#160;billion and then by increments of $50&#160;billion thereafter, with each incremental increase being approximately equivalent to Tesla&#8217;s approximate market capitalization of $50&#160;billion in late 2017. &#8203; &#8226; To meet all 12 Market Capitalization Milestones, Tesla was required to add approximately $600&#160;billion to its market capitalization. In setting the details of the award in 2018, the Board at the time considered the Market Capitalization Milestones to be challenging hurdles, which Mr.&#160;Musk met. &#8203; &#8226; There were also 16 operational milestones, half of which were focused on top-line performance and half of which were focused on bottom-line performance. Any one of the Operational Milestones, including one of the eight Revenue milestones or one of the eight Adjusted EBITDA milestones, could have been paired with any of the 12 Market Capitalization Milestones to successfully achieve the vesting of one of the 12 tranches. Any single Operational Milestone could have only satisfied the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding Market Capitalization Milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 Operational Milestones would have not resulted in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr.&#160;Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. &#8203; In 2018, the Board considered the Revenue milestones to be challenging hurdles as they significantly exceeded Tesla&#8217;s historic annual revenue, which was approximately $7.0&#160;billion for 2016 and approximately $11.8&#160;billion for 2017. To achieve the first or second of the Revenue milestones, Tesla would have needed to increase its revenue by 3x and 5x, respectively, from its 2016 revenue levels. To satisfy all eight Revenue milestones, Tesla would have needed to increase revenue by almost $168&#160;billion. The significance of these hurdles was noted in contemporary news reports, &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; with The New York Times for example running a story under the headline &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History&#8221; on January&#160;23, 2018, stating that the final Market Capitalization Milestone represented &#8220;a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible&#8221; and that critics would be &#8220;likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company&#8217;s latest publicity stunt.&#8221; Sorkin, Andrew Ross. New York Times. &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History.&#8221; In addition to the Revenue milestones and to promote Tesla&#8217;s continued focus on a balanced approach to both growth and profitability, the 2018 CEO Performance Award included eight profitability milestones. In 2018, the Compensation Committee and the Board selected Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as EBITDA minus only non-cash charges for stock-based compensation, as the appropriate profitability measure because the Board believed at the time that it was a metric that was commonly used for companies at Tesla&#8217;s stage of development and because many of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders used it to evaluate Tesla&#8217;s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of cash generation from operations that does not disincentivize Tesla from making additional investments to grow further. Like the Revenue milestones described above, the Adjusted EBITDA milestones were designed to be challenging and to reflect Tesla&#8217;s objective to have strong bottom-line performance on a consistent basis. In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2018, the Board believed it carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla&#8217;s growth trajectory and internal growth plans at the time and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that had invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla&#8217;s plans for future growth. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the Market Capitalization Milestones was based on both (i)&#160;a six-calendar-month trailing average of Tesla&#8217;s stock price as well as (ii)&#160;a 30-calendar-day trailing average of Tesla&#8217;s stock price, in each case based on trading days only, and thus required sustained market capitalization appreciation, not simply a spike in market capitalization over a short period. Measurement of the Operational Milestones was based on the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters for each of Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, each determined on an aggregate basis, based on publicly disclosed Tesla financial statements. Term of 2018 CEO Performance Award / Post-Termination of Employment Exercise Period .&#160;&#160;&#160;The term of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was set as 10&#160;years from the date of the grant, unless Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s employment with Tesla was terminated prior to such date. Accordingly, Mr.&#160;Musk was entitled to exercise any portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award until January&#160;20, 2028 that had vested on or prior to such date, provided that he remains employed at Tesla. For additional information regarding the vesting dates, see &#8220;Compensation Discussion &amp; Analysis&#8221; elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. Additionally, Mr.&#160;Musk was entitled up to one year following the termination of his employment with Tesla to exercise any portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that vested prior to such termination, subject to any earlier expiration of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on January&#160;20, 2028. Further, the 2018 CEO Performance Award also could have terminated earlier in connection with a change in control event of Tesla, as described further below. Five-Year Holding Period .&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk was required to hold shares that he would have acquired upon the exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for five&#160;years post-exercise, not post-vesting (except for shares used to pay exercise price and tax withholdings, or in certain other limited circumstances described further below). After reviewing market practices for post-exercise holding periods for executive equity awards in 2018, the Board believed a five-year holding period, which was the longest period considered by the Board, to be very atypical of executive equity awards generally because of its unusually long duration. Nevertheless, the Board in 2018 selected a five-year holding period in order to further align Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s interests with Tesla stockholders&#8217; interests for five&#160;years following the exercise of &#160; 70 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; any options under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, since Mr.&#160;Musk would continue to bear the risk and reward of changes in the value of Tesla&#8217;s stock during the five-year holding period. The Board in 2018 believed that such alignment complemented the requirements for sustained increases to Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization levels, Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in order to meet the applicable vesting milestones under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, and would ensure that Mr.&#160;Musk would be focused on the long term value in building and sustaining Tesla&#8217;s success both before, and even after he achieved, vesting under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Moreover, the requirement of a five-year holding period significantly decreased the stock-based compensation expense that Tesla recognized for the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Pursuant to&#160;Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (&#8220; ASC Topic&#160;718 &#8221;), the maximum stock-based compensation expense in respect of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that Tesla recognized upon the achievement of all performance milestones was the actual aggregate fair value of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, computed on the date that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was approved by our stockholders at the Company&#8217;s special meeting of stockholders on March&#160;21, 2018 (the &#8220; 2018 Special Meeting &#8221;). The five-year post-exercise holding period in the 2018 CEO Performance Award reduced the aggregate fair value of the 2018 CEO Performance Award by $278.9&#160;million as of March 21, 2018. Leadership Requirement .&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk needed to lead Tesla&#8217;s management at the time each milestone was to be met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Specifically, he needed to have been serving as either Tesla&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as both its Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer, in each case with all leadership ultimately reporting to him. Termination of Employment .&#160;&#160;&#160;There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance Award if the employment of Mr.&#160;Musk was terminated, or if Mr.&#160;Musk were to have died or become disabled. In other words, termination of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s employment with Tesla would have precluded his ability to earn any then-unvested portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award following the date of his termination. Vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have been suspended in the event of any leave of absence by Mr.&#160;Musk. Change in Control of Tesla .&#160;&#160;&#160;If Tesla experienced a change in control event, such as a merger with or purchase by another company, vesting under the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have not been automatically accelerated. In a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the Market Capitalization Milestones, with the measurement of Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla&#8217;s stockholders in the change in control. The treatment of the 2018 CEO Performance Award upon a change in control was designed to align Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s interests with Tesla&#8217;s other stockholders with respect to evaluating potential takeover offers. Exercise Methods / Requirements .&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk was eligible to exercise any vested options under the 2018 CEO Performance Award in one of two ways: (i)&#160;a cashless exercise or (ii)&#160;a cash exercise. A cashless exercise occurs when the stock option is exercised and the shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding. A cash exercise simply involves paying the Tesla option exercise price in cash. Clawback Provision .&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event of a restatement of Tesla&#8217;s financial statements previously filed with the SEC (&#8220; restated financial results &#8221;), and if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Mr.&#160;Musk would have been required to forfeit (or repay, as applicable) the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr.&#160;Musk would have been paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award also would have been subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr.&#160;Musk except as required by applicable law. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; M&amp;A Adjustment .&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that Tesla acquired a business with a purchase price of more than $1&#160;billion, any then-unachieved Market Capitalization Milestones would have been increased by the purchase price of such acquisition. Similarly, if the target of an acquisition transaction had revenue or adjusted EBITDA (based on cumulative four consecutive quarters prior to the transaction) of more than $500&#160;million and $100&#160;million, respectively, the then-unachieved Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA Milestones (as applicable) would have been increased by such target&#8217;s revenue or adjusted EBITDA (as applicable). This feature of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was designed to prevent achievement of milestones based on acquisition activity that could be considered material to the achievement of those milestones. Likewise, in the event that Tesla entered into a transaction constituting a split-up, spin-off or divestiture that had a value over $1&#160;billion, any then-unachieved Market Capitalization Milestones would be decreased by the value of such transaction. Also, if an entity with more than $500&#160;million or $100&#160;million of revenue or adjusted EBITDA, respectively, was divested by Tesla, the then-unachieved Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA Milestones (as applicable) would have been decreased by the amount of revenue or adjusted EBITDA (as applicable) divested in such a transaction. Other Details Regarding 2018 CEO Performance Award Administration .&#160;&#160;&#160;The 2018 CEO Performance Award was administered by the Board, the Compensation Committee, or any committee of Board members or other individuals (excluding Mr.&#160;Musk) appointed by the Board and satisfying applicable laws (the &#8220; Administrator &#8221;), provided that Mr.&#160;Musk recused himself from any approvals relating to the administration of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. References to the Board in the executive summary of the material terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award under the section titled &#8220; Material Terms of the Proposed 2018 CEO Performance Award &#8221; above generally are references to the Administrator, as applicable. The Administrator has the power and authority, in good faith, to interpret the 2018 CEO Performance Award and adopt rules for its administration, interpretation and application of the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. All actions taken, and interpretations and determinations made, by the Administrator in good faith with respect to the 2018 CEO Performance Award will be final and binding on Mr.&#160;Musk and any other interested persons. Certain Other Market Capitalization Provisions .&#160;&#160;&#160;For purposes of achieving the Market Capitalization Milestones, the Company&#8217;s market capitalization was based on an average of the Company&#8217;s market capitalization for all trading days in the applicable trailing six-calendar-month period or 30-calendar-day period. As of any date of determination, the applicable six month or 30-day period ended with (and was inclusive of) such determination date. The Company&#8217;s market capitalization on any particular trading day is equal to the product of the closing price of a share of Tesla&#8217;s common stock on the trading day, multiplied by the outstanding shares of Tesla common stock at the closing of the trading day. Certain Other Termination Provisions .&#160;&#160;&#160;In all cases, the award agreement provided that in the event that Tesla stockholders did not approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award within 12&#160;months after its grant date or, at any meeting of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders, did not approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award by the requisite vote, the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have been automatically forfeited and Mr.&#160;Musk would have had no rights to the 2018 CEO Performance Award or the shares underlying it. Upon a change in control of Tesla, any vested portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have been assumed or substituted by the successor and any unvested portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award automatically would have been terminated at the effective time of the change in control event. The Administrator could not accelerate the vesting of any portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award in connection with a change in control if the Market Capitalization Milestone (as determined at the time of a change in control) was not met. The vested and unexercised portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have remained exercisable through its expiration date. If Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s role either as Chief Executive Officer or as Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer terminated while the 2018 CEO Performance Award was outstanding, the Administrator would have promptly made a final determination as to whether any additional tranches had vested through the date of such termination and whether any portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that had failed to vest based on performance through such date of termination will be forfeited. &#160; 72 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Certain Other Adjustments Upon Certain Transactions .&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event of any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of Tesla common stock, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Tesla&#8217;s securities, or other change in the corporate structure of Tesla affecting Tesla&#8217;s common stock, then the Administrator, in order to prevent the diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2018 CEO Performance Award (and in a manner that would not provide any greater benefit or potential benefits than intended to be made available, other than solely to reflect changes resulting from any such triggering event), would have adjusted the number, class and price of the shares of our common stock underlying the 2018 CEO Performance Award. In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of Tesla, the Administrator would have notified Mr.&#160;Musk as soon as practicable before the effective date of the proposed transaction. To the extent the 2018 CEO Performance Award had not been previously exercised, it would have terminated immediately before the completion of such proposed transaction. Mr.&#160;Musk was entitled to no rights or privileges of a stockholder of Tesla with respect to the shares of our common stock underlying the 2018 CEO Performance Award unless and until the shares of our common stock were issued, recorded on the records of Tesla or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Mr.&#160;Musk (which may occur through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). In addition, unless and until Tesla&#8217;s stockholders approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award, no portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award may be exercised. Certain Other Securities Information .&#160;&#160;&#160;Shares issuable under the 2018 CEO Performance Award were authorized, but unissued, or reacquired, Tesla common stock. As of April&#160;12, 2024, the closing price of Tesla&#8217;s common stock was $171.05 per share. Tax Withholdings .&#160;&#160;&#160;The Administrator was to determine the methods by which tax withholding obligations with respect to the 2018 CEO Performance Award were to be satisfied by Mr.&#160;Musk. For example, to the extent permissible by applicable law, the Administrator could have permitted Mr.&#160;Musk to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the 2018 CEO Performance Award by (i)&#160;paying cash, or (ii)&#160;having a sufficient number of shares otherwise deliverable under the 2018 CEO Performance Award sold through means determined by Tesla (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the minimum required amount to be withheld (or such greater amount that Mr.&#160;Musk elects, if permitted by the Administrator and if withholding a greater amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences for Tesla). Non-transferability .&#160;&#160;&#160;The 2018 CEO Performance Award could not be transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s lifetime only by him. Shares of our common stock issued to Mr.&#160;Musk upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award were subject to the holding period described further above, except that Mr.&#160;Musk could have transferred shares to change the form in which he held the shares of our common stock, such as through certain family or estate planning trusts, or as permitted by the Administrator consistent with the Company&#8217;s internal policies. Background of the Proposal General In 2018, after&#160;months of consideration and discussion, and following a recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board, with Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s brother and a member of our Board, recusing themselves, approved the 2018 CEO Performance Award and recommended it to our stockholders. We called a special meeting of our stockholders to submit the 2018 CEO Performance Award for approval. At this time, the 2018 CEO Performance Award was approved by (i)&#160;the majority of the total votes of shares of our common stock cast in person or by proxy, (ii)&#160;the majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal, and (iii)&#160;approximately 73% of all votes cast by disinterested stockholders (i.e., stockholders other than Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk). Only after obtaining this approval by our stockholders was the 2018 CEO Performance Award put in place. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; As discussed below, following a lawsuit brought by a stockholder regarding our decision to incentivize and compensate Mr.&#160;Musk, on January&#160;30, 2024, the Delaware Court issued the Tornetta Opinion holding that, among other things, the Board breached its fiduciary duties in approving the 2018 CEO Performance Award and ordering rescission of the 2018 CEO Performance Award as a remedy. With the Tornetta Opinion, the Delaware Court ordered the rescission of a corporate decision that every company&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;public, or private, for-profit or not-for-profit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;makes; that is, how to retain, compensate and motivate the individuals who devote time, energy, resources and skill to building an enterprise, forsaking the opportunity to pursue other opportunities and interests. The Tornetta Opinion created a fundamental problem for our Company. The Delaware Court&#8217;s rescission of the 2018 CEO Performance Award meant that, absent further action, Mr.&#160;Musk would not have received any compensation for nearly six&#160;years of service to Tesla&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a period in which Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership and vision drove us to popularize electric vehicles, led to groundbreaking innovations in artificial intelligence and sustainable energy, and grew the Company&#8217;s market capitalization from $53.7 billion as of March&#160;21, 2018 to $791.3&#160;billion at the end of 2023, an increase of over $700 billion, or almost 1,400%, making Tesla the seventh largest company by market capitalization traded on a U.S. securities exchange. In light of this, in March&#160;2024, the Board granted the Special Committee the authority, in addition to considering the Texas Redomestication, to also consider, evaluate, and determine whether it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to consider Ratification through a stockholder vote (including, without limitation, the manner of any applicable stockholder vote), or other disclosures about Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation, consistent with all applicable legal and other requirements and the Board resolved not to proceed with respect to this expanded purpose without the prior favorable recommendation of the Special Committee. The 2018 Approval Process As you consider the Ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, the Company has summarized the process followed in 2018 relating to the approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because the Tornetta Opinion found our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on February 8, 2018 (the &#8220; 2018 Proxy Statement &#8221;) did not include a full and accurate description of the process behind the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we are providing you with the below disclosure. You should read this disclosure, together with the summary of the Tornetta Opinion contained below, as well as the copy of the Tornetta Opinion attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex I for a description of the approval process. The Tornetta Opinion attached to this Proxy Statement and the summary of the Tornetta Opinion contained below describe the Court&#8217;s criticisms of this process. While the Company believes the discussion under this caption &#8220; The 2018 Approval Process &#8221; is a true and correct statement of the facts leading up to the approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and illustrates the effectiveness of the governance process followed at the time, stockholders are cautioned that the Tornetta Opinion made negative findings about the approval process in 2018. The Company believes that its stockholders should take into account the relevant analysis and reasons expressed in the section entitled &#8220; Overview of 2018 Approval Process &#8221;, as well as the critiques set forth in the Tornetta Opinion in the section entitled &#8220; Tornetta v. Musk Decision and Deficiencies Found by The Court &#8221;, as they consider Ratification. Overview of 2018 Approval Process In 2012, the Board approved a compensation program for Mr.&#160;Musk that consisted entirely of performance stock options that would vest only upon the achievement of certain market capitalization and operational milestones (the &#8220; 2012 CEO Performance Award &#8221;). At the time, Tesla had begun to execute Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s Master Plan that laid out the objectives for Tesla during the first phase of its development. Tesla had yet to begin volume production of Model S and had a market capitalization of under $4&#160;billion. The vesting milestones for the 2012 CEO Performance Award included 10 tranches, with each tranche requiring Tesla both to: (i) grow market capitalization by an additional $4&#160;billion, and &#8203; (ii) achieve an additional specified operational milestone. &#8203; &#160; 74 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Following the grant of the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla received strong stockholder support in its triennial advisory &#8220;Say on Pay&#8221; votes in 2014 and 2017 (94.4% and 98.9%, respectively, of the shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote). Between 2012 and 2018, Tesla, with Mr.&#160;Musk at the helm, among other things, launched and ramped up production of Model S; designed, launched and ramped up production of Model X and Model 3; and added important new business lines, including solar energy generation and energy storage. With the 2012 CEO Performance Award nearing completion, the Board and the Compensation Committee engaged in more than six&#160;months of active and ongoing discussions regarding a new compensation program for Mr.&#160;Musk, ultimately deciding to approve the grant in the 2018 CEO Performance Award. These discussions first took place among the then-members of the Compensation Committee, all of whom were independent directors, and then with the Board&#8217;s other independent directors. For each of the relevant meetings, both Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk recused themselves. In deciding to approve the grant in the 2018 CEO Performance Award, the Board and the Compensation Committee considered among other things: (i) The reasons for an award; &#8203; (ii) The desire to incentivize and motivate Mr.&#160;Musk to continue to lead Tesla over the long term and to create significant stockholder value in doing so; &#8203; (iii) How to structure an award in a way that would further align the interests of Mr.&#160;Musk and Tesla&#8217;s other stockholders; &#8203; (iv) Whether to model an award based on elements of the 2012 CEO Performance Award; &#8203; (v) What performance milestones should be used in an award; &#8203; (vi) What the total size of an award should be and how that size would translate into increased ownership and value for Mr.&#160;Musk; and &#8203; (vii) How to balance the risks and rewards of a new award. &#8203; Throughout this process in 2018, the Board used the services of Compensia, Inc. which served as its independent compensation consultant (&#8220; Compensia &#8221;), and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, P.C., which served as its special outside counsel. At various points during the process in 2018, the independent members of the Board met with Mr.&#160;Musk to share their thoughts on the award and to solicit his perspective, including as to each of the issues identified above, and ultimately to negotiate the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award with Mr.&#160;Musk. Additionally, early in the Board&#8217;s 2018 process, at the request of the Compensation Committee, Ira Ehrenpreis and Tesla&#8217;s then-General Counsel, Todd Maron, had calls with 15 of Tesla&#8217;s largest institutional stockholders to discuss and solicit their views regarding the 2012 CEO Performance Award and considerations for a new compensation award for Mr.&#160;Musk, in light of the fact that nearly all of the milestones in the 2012 CEO Performance Award had been or would be achieved in the near future. Many of these stockholders indicated that they favored the approach used in the 2012&#160;CEO Performance Award, especially when coupled with Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s lack of traditional non-performance-based types of compensation (i.e., no salary, no cash bonuses, no time-based equity awards), and indicated that they favored a new equity award to Mr.&#160;Musk broadly based on the model of the 2012 CEO Performance Award that would motivate and incentivize his continued service and dedication to Tesla. Stockholders suggested various operational milestones to pair with market capitalization milestones, but in general expressed preferences for financial-based operational milestones that would ensure both top-line and bottom-line Tesla growth as a condition for awards of compensation to Mr.&#160;Musk. As the Board thereafter deliberated on a new performance award for Mr.&#160;Musk, it gave great weight to the feedback that its stockholders provided during these calls, and it incorporated much of that feedback into the ultimate design of the award. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 75 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; After engaging in this extended process and arriving at terms for a performance award that both the independent members of the Board and Mr.&#160;Musk concluded would motivate and incentivize Mr.&#160;Musk to continue to lead the management of Tesla over the long term, the Board, with Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves, approved the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Reasons for the Board&#8217;s 2018 Recommendation In advance of the Company&#8217;s 2018 Special Meeting, which was called for the purposes of obtaining a stockholder vote on the 2018 CEO Performance Award, the Board recommended that its stockholders vote their shares &#8220;FOR&#8221; the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Prior to the 2018 Special Meeting, the independent members of the Board at the time, led by the members of the Compensation Committee, designed a compensation award over the course of six&#160;months that they believed would incentivize Mr.&#160;Musk while maximizing value for Tesla stockholders. As part of this process in 2018, the Compensation Committee and the Board sought to balance a variety of important objectives, including: &#8226; Aligning Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s interests with those of Tesla and its other stockholders; &#8203; &#8226; Incentivizing Mr.&#160;Musk to continue to lead Tesla over the long term; &#8203; &#8226; Motivating Mr.&#160;Musk to help Tesla achieve market capitalization and operational milestones that would generate significant stockholder value; and &#8203; &#8226; Ensuring that Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation will be linked entirely to performance so that he does not receive any compensation unless all of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders benefit from significant value creation. &#8203; The Board sought and obtained feedback from a broad set of institutional stockholders and incorporated that feedback into its decision-making process. As part of its consideration in 2018, the Board drew from the success of the 2012 CEO Performance Award. Such award helped Tesla grow its market capitalization from less than $4&#160;billion to over $55&#160;billion in just over five&#160;years, and formed the biggest part of the executive compensation program that Tesla stockholders strongly supported in advisory &#8220;Say on Pay&#8221; votes in 2014 and 2017. Additionally, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award milestones largely achieved, and with Tesla entering the next phase of its development, the Board sought to develop a compensation award for Mr.&#160;Musk that reflected Tesla&#8217;s then-current long-term goals and strategy and helped incentivize their achievement. During the initial phase of its development, Tesla executed on its original Master Plan, which primarily called for Tesla to develop electric vehicles in increasingly affordable and higher volume segments. Even though most believed that Tesla would not be able to accomplish this, Tesla managed to do so, and it created significant stockholder value in the process. With Tesla becoming the world&#8217;s first vertically integrated sustainable energy company, from generation to storage to consumption, its ambitions in 2018 were even greater. Tesla in its original Master Plan intended to: &#8226; Expand solar energy generation through Solar Roof and other solar products, and seamlessly integrate them with battery storage; &#8203; &#8226; Build out Tesla&#8217;s vehicle product line to cover all major forms of terrestrial transport; &#8203; &#8226; Advance autonomous technology to create a fully-self driving future; and &#8203; &#8226; Through sharing, enable its customers&#8217; cars to make money for them when they are not being used. &#8203; With these goals, in 2018 the Board believed that Tesla had the potential to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The 2018 CEO Performance Award was based on a vision of making Tesla a $650&#160;billion company&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more than ten times more valuable than it was at the beginning of 2018&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and accomplishing Tesla&#8217;s mission of accelerating the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. &#160; 76 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The Board recommended that its stockholders approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award in 2018 for the following reasons: 1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Strengthening Incentives and Further Aligning of Stockholder, Company and CEO Interests The Board believed in rewarding Mr.&#160;Musk in a fair way that provided compensation to him if, and only if, all of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders realized significant value. Under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr.&#160;Musk would not receive any of the kinds of guaranteed forms of compensation that are common for chief executive officers at other companies. Mr.&#160;Musk would receive no cash salary, no cash bonuses and no time-based equity awards that vest solely through the passage of time (that is, simply by continuing to show up for work). To the contrary, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s only opportunity to earn compensation from Tesla would be dependent on him leading Tesla&#8217;s achievement of challenging milestones, which, among other things, required Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization to increase to $100&#160;billion, and to then continue increasing in additional $50&#160;billion increments thereafter, up to $650&#160;billion. Additionally, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation would also be dependent on him leading Tesla&#8217;s achievement of challenging operational milestones, which were designed to ensure that it is executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis. Under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, if these ambitious milestones were met, the Board determined in 2018, all Tesla stockholders would benefit, with the value of Tesla&#8217;s equity growing by tens of billions of dollars per milestone. Moreover, under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, in contrast to Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s rights, which required a pair of milestone targets to be fully met in order for him to receive any vesting of the corresponding tranche, the Tesla stockholders would realize the real-time benefit of any increases to its stock price, even those that result from falling short of the specific milestone targets required by the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Finally, the 2018 CEO Performance Award would create even more stockholder alignment by incorporating features such as a five-year holding period that ensures Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s continuing alignment with company interests for many&#160;years even after he exercises his options. As such, the Board in 2018 determined that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was a true &#8220;pay-for-performance&#8221; compensation program that tightly aligned Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s interests with the interests of Tesla and its stockholders. 2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Ensuring Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s Continued Services The Board in 2018 believed that having the active and engaged services of Mr.&#160;Musk was important to the continued growth and long-term interests of Tesla. While the Board recognized that Tesla had many valuable employees who have been a critical part of Tesla&#8217;s success, the Board in 2018 believed that many of Tesla&#8217;s prior successes were driven significantly by Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership. Those successes included making Model S the top-selling car in its segment in many key markets around the world and ramping up the production of it, designing and ramping up the production of Model X, which continued to gain substantial market share around the world, and designing and beginning to ramp up the production of Model 3, the mass-market vehicle that the success of Model S and Model X enabled. These accomplishments had led to significant value creation for Tesla&#8217;s stockholders. Since going public, Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization had grown almost 35x when the Board approved the plan in 2018. The Board designed the 2018 CEO Performance Award to incentivize and motivate Mr.&#160;Musk to continue to not only lead Tesla over the long term, but particularly in light of his other business interests, to devote his time and energy in doing so. In the Board&#8217;s discussions with Mr.&#160;Musk in 2018, he indicated that the 2018 CEO Performance Award would accomplish that. Mr.&#160;Musk was required to remain as Tesla&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer or serve as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer, in each case with all leadership ultimately reporting to him, at the time each milestone was met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. This was intended to ensure that Mr.&#160;Musk would continue to lead the management of Tesla over the long term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another chief executive officer who would report to Mr.&#160;Musk at some point in the future. Although there was no intention to bring in another chief executive officer, the Board in 2018 believed that having such flexibility as Tesla continued to grow to potentially allow Mr.&#160;Musk to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impacted Tesla&#8217;s long-term growth and profitability would benefit our stockholders. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 77 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Spurring the Achievement of Tesla&#8217;s Strategic and Financial Objectives The Board believed in 2018 that the 2012 CEO Performance Award was instrumental in motivating Mr.&#160;Musk to lead Tesla&#8217;s achievement of the objectives set out in the original Master Plan, thereby generating the significant stockholder value that was created during the process. With the first Master Plan having been achieved and with the second part of the Master Plan having been announced, the 2018 CEO Performance Award was designed to help align Tesla and its employees as they design, engineer and make the products that execute on the master plan, and focus everyone at Tesla on achieving the market capitalization and operational milestones that, while challenging, the Board believed were attainable for Tesla. If all of these milestones were to be achieved, Tesla would have meaningfully achieved its mission of transitioning the world to sustainable energy and would have become one of the most valuable and successful companies in the world. 2018 Stockholder Vote At the 2018 Special Meeting, our stockholders voted on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Our stockholders approved the 2018 CEO Performance Award at the 2018 Special Meeting by the affirmative vote of each of: (1) the majority of the total votes of shares of Tesla common stock cast in person or by proxy at the 2018 Special Meeting, pursuant to the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules (the &#8220; 2018 Nasdaq Standard &#8221;); &#8203; (2) the majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the 2018 Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, pursuant to Tesla&#8217;s amended and restated bylaws (the &#8220; 2018 Bylaws Standard &#8221;); and &#8203; (3) the majority of the total votes of shares of Tesla common stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast in person or by proxy at the 2018 Special Meeting, pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors of Tesla adopted in connection with the 2018 Special Meeting (the &#8220; 2018 Disinterested Standard &#8221;). &#8203; Later that day, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing the results of the votes at the 2018 Special Meeting. Tornetta v. Musk Decision and Deficiencies Found by the Court Following the 2018 Special Meeting, on June&#160;5, 2018, Richard Tornetta, a stockholder of the Company holding nine shares of our common stock at the time (prior to giving effect to various stock splits), in his individual capacity and on behalf of all other similarly situated stockholders of the Company and derivatively on behalf of the Company, filed a complaint in the Delaware Court alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and waste. Mr.&#160;Tornetta alleged, and the Delaware Court held, that Mr.&#160;Musk controlled the Board, leading to an unfair process surrounding the formulation and approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, as well as that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was not fair. The Company and the Board believe that the decision in Tornetta ignored material evidence presented at trial and that the Delaware Court made errors of fact and incorrect conclusions of law. The named director defendants intend to appeal the Delaware Court&#8217;s decision vigorously. Moreover, the stockholders&#8217; vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting on whether to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award is independent and separate from the named director defendants&#8217; intended appeal of the Delaware Court&#8217;s order. The description of the Tornetta Opinion below should not be read to endorse or agree with the findings of fact or conclusions of law in it. Nevertheless, the Company believes that stockholders in evaluating the matters presented to them for their approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting should understand the conclusions reached by the Delaware Court and the bases for those conclusions; therefore, the description below summarizes the Tornetta Opinion, and a copy of the Tornetta Opinion is attached as Annex I to this Proxy Statement. &#160; 78 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; We have summarized here the significant rulings of the Delaware Court in the Tornetta Opinion, and are also including a copy of the Tornetta Opinion as Annex I to this Proxy Statement, to ensure that all relevant disclosures are available to our stockholders. The summary below does not purport to be a complete and exhaustive summary of the Tornetta Opinion, and therefore, Annex I is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s Control Mr.&#160;Tornetta alleged, and the Delaware Court decided, that Mr.&#160;Musk is a controlling stockholder of Tesla for the purposes of approving the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Delaware Court then found that in a conflicted-controller transaction, unless a board of directors follows a judicially-prescribed path involving the establishment of a special committee authorized to make a decision on such transaction and then obtains the fully informed, uncoerced approval of the majority of the voting power of disinterested stockholders, the &#8220;entire fairness&#8221; standard of review will apply to the transaction. Based on four factors, the Delaware Court concluded that Mr.&#160;Musk was a controlling stockholder for purposes of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: Mr. Musk Wielded Significant Influence over Tesla by Virtue of His Stock Holdings First , the Delaware Court agreed with Mr.&#160;Tornetta that: Musk&#8217;s 21.9% block&#8230; gives him a sizable leg-up for stockholder votes generally and the ability to block specific categories of bylaw amendments. The block also gives him great influence in the boardroom. This undoubtedly contributes to his clout and sway. The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: Mr.&#160;Musk was a &#8220;Superstar CEO&#8221; Second , the Delaware Court labeled Mr.&#160;Musk a &#8220;Superstar CEO&#8221;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the type of chief executive officer whose identity is interwoven with that of the company&#8217;s and therefore has a &#8220;singular importance shift[ing] the balance of power between management, the board, and the stockholders.&#8221; According to the Delaware Court, &#8220;[i]n the face of a Superstar CEO, it is even more imperative than usual for a company to employ robust protections for minority stockholders, such as staunchly independent directors. In this case, Tesla&#8217;s fiduciaries were not staunchly independent.&#8221; The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: The Board&#8217;s Independence Was Compromised Third , the Delaware Court concluded that Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s personal and professional relationships with the Board compromised the Board&#8217;s and the Compensation Committee&#8217;s independence. For example, the Delaware Court determined that several Board members (who were also members of the Compensation Committee) owed the bulk of their fortunes to investments in Musk-affiliated entities, and that several Board and Compensation Committee members were also friends with Mr.&#160;Musk, Kimbal Musk, and the Musk family. In addition, the Delaware Court determined that Todd Maron, Tesla&#8217;s General Counsel at the time who had also previously served as Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s divorce attorney, was &#8220;totally beholden to Musk&#8221; because he was &#8220;moved [] to tears during his deposition&#8221; on account of his &#8220;admiration for Musk.&#8221; The Delaware Court also noted that Mr.&#160;Maron was a &#8220;primary go-between&#8221; of Mr.&#160;Musk and the Compensation Committee in connection with the negotiation of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and that &#8220;many of the documents cited by [Tesla] as proof of a fair process were drafted by Mr.&#160;Maron.&#8221; As a result, even though Mr.&#160;Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk recused themselves from the Board&#8217;s vote to approve on the 2018 CEO Performance Award, the Delaware Court determined that the Compensation Committee&#8217;s recommendation and the Board&#8217;s approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award were not made independent of influence from Mr.&#160;Musk. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 79 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: Mr.&#160;Musk Controlled the Board&#8217;s Consideration of the 2018 CEO Performance Award Fourth , the Delaware Court concluded that multiple aspects of the Board&#8217;s consideration of the 2018 CEO Performance Award revealed Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s control over it, &#8220;including the timeline, the absence of negotiations over the magnitude of the Grant or its other terms, and the committee&#8217;s failure to conduct a benchmarking analysis.&#8221; According to the Delaware Court, the 2018 CEO Performance Award did not receive sufficient substantive consideration or time from the Board before the Board approved it, and instead: [T]here is barely any evidence of negotiations at all. Rather than negotiate against Musk with the mindset of a third party, the Compensation Committee worked alongside him, almost as an advisory body. The Delaware Court expressed concern over the fact that Mr.&#160;Musk proposed the initial terms of his compensation plan and drove the timing of negotiations around the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Delaware Court found that: Musk unilaterally set the timeline or made last-minute proposals to the Board prior to six out of the ten Board or Compensation Committee meetings during which the [2018 CEO Performance Award] was discussed. Musk dictated when the game clock started and stopped, thereby artificially compressing the work into short bursts that took place when he wished to move forward. Musk&#8217;s habit of shaking things up just before meetings also made it tough for the committee and its advisors to be prepared. The Delaware Court also observed that although &#8220;nine&#160;months passed&#8221; between the initial meeting about the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the Board&#8217;s approval of it, &#8220;most of the work on the [2018 CEO Performance Award] occurred during small segments of that nine-month timeline and under significant time pressure imposed by Musk,&#8221; resulting in what it believed to be a &#8220;recklessly fast approach.&#8221; The Delaware Court also stated that negotiations between Mr.&#160;Musk and the Board were compromised because they were not adversarial and were too cooperative and collaborative. To the contrary, the Delaware Court noted that several of the participants in the process testified that the negotiations between Mr.&#160;Musk and the Board regarding his compensation were not adversarial or &#8220;acrimonious.&#8221; Combined, these and certain other factors led the Delaware Court to conclude that the negotiation process was not at arm&#8217;s length, and was not fair. The Delaware Court also found that the Board largely accepted terms Mr.&#160;Musk proposed for his own compensation plan, without considering other alternatives, and omitted certain terms that would have been in the best interests of our stockholders. For example, the Delaware Court stressed that a key goal of the Board was &#8220;it[s] wish[] to retain Musk as the &#8216;fully engaged CEO,&#8217; yet&#8221; the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award did not require him to devote a certain&#160;percentage of his time to Tesla relative to his other companies, and also &#8220;allowed Musk to step down to the role of &#8216;Chief Product Officer.&#8217;&#8221; The Delaware Court also stated that &#8220;there was no actual discussion concerning alternatives&#8221; to the compensation plan proposals that Mr.&#160;Musk was setting forth, and that &#8220;[t]here [w]as [n]o [n]egotiation [o]ver [t]he [s]ize [o]f [t]he [g]rant.&#8221; The Delaware Court also criticized the Board for not reviewing benchmarking compensation studies that would compare the proposed 2018 CEO Performance Award &#8220;to plans at comparable firms.&#8221; According to the Delaware Court, the defendants&#8217; &#8220;proffered reasons for not performing a traditional benchmarking study [(that they had sufficient information to know what a benchmarking study would show and that they didn&#8217;t believe such a study was apt because there were no true comparables)]. . . rang hollow&#8221;, and that &#8220;[b]enchmarking would have informed the decision makers of the magnitude of difference between the [g]rant and market comparables.&#8221; The Delaware Court also concluded that the defendants failed to prove that the 2018 CEO Performance Award&#8217;s milestones were &#8220;ambitious and difficult to achieve,&#8221; such that they would require compensation of the 2018 CEO Performance Award&#8217;s magnitude to incentivize Mr.&#160;Musk to attain them. Instead, the Delaware Court noted that: &#160; 80 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Tesla determined that three operational milestones were &#8216;considered probable of achievement,&#8217; which meant that they were greater than 70% probable of achievement within approximately one year of the Grant date. Finally, the Delaware Court rejected the defendants&#8217; argument that certain other terms that were included in the 2018 CEO Performance Award for the Company&#8217;s benefit, the Clawback Provision, the Leadership Requirement, the Five-Year Hold Period and the M&amp;A Adjustment (each as described above and defined in the Tornetta Opinion), were evidence of arm&#8217;s-length bargaining, since Mr.&#160;Musk accepted them without negotiation. With respect to these provisions, the Delaware Court found that: The other key terms of the Grant were: the Clawback Provision, the Leadership Requirement, the Five-Year Hold Period, and the M&amp;A Adjustment. As to these terms, the only back-and-forth in the record concerned the M&amp;A Adjustment, but Musk himself conceded that this was at most a minor feature of his compensation plan that he did not care about. He stated, at the end of negotiations on this point, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we will be making big acquisitions[]&#8221; and &#8220;[t]here is no chance I will game the economics here, so I&#8217;m fine with limits that prevent that. The Delaware Court Found the Stockholder Vote Upon Which the 2018 CEO Performance Award Was Conditioned Was Deficient In addition to finding the Board process related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award to have been deficient, the Delaware Court also found that the stockholder vote at the 2018 Special Meeting on which the 2018 CEO Performance Award&#8217;s approval was conditioned was not fully informed. The Delaware Court&#8217;s finding that the stockholder vote at the 2018 Special Meeting was not fully informed was based on the failure of the 2018 Proxy Statement to disclose the shortcomings that the Delaware Court had found in the Board&#8217;s decision-making process. The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: the 2018 Proxy Statement Contained No Conflict Disclosures First , the Delaware Court stated that in presenting the 2018 CEO Performance Award to our stockholders, we had failed to disclose any actual or potential conflicts between the 2018 CEO Performance Award&#8217;s decision-makers and Mr.&#160;Musk, instead describing &#8220;all of [them] [as] independent directors&#8221; and &#8220;independent members of the Board.&#8221; In particular, the 2018 proxy statement did not disclose the financial or personal connections between the members of the Compensation Committee and Mr.&#160;Musk. These included a 15-year relationship between Mr.&#160;Musk and the chair of the Compensation Committee, Ira Ehrenpreis, and business relationships between Mr.&#160;Musk and the other Compensation Committee member, Antonio Gracias, &#8220;dating back over 20&#160;years, as well as the sort of personal relationship that had [Mr.&#160;Gracias] vacationing with Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s family on a regular basis.&#8221; The Delaware Court&#8217;s Analysis: the 2018 Proxy Statement did not Include a Full and Accurate Description of the Process Second , the Delaware Court determined that we did not provide our stockholders with a &#8220;full and accurate description of the material steps in the Board or the Compensation Committee process that resulted in the transaction.&#8221; The Delaware Court noted that the 2018 proxy statement &#8220;does not disclose the level of control that Musk exercised over the process&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;e.g., his control over the timing, the fact that he made the initial offer, the fact that his initial offer set the terms until he changed them six&#160;months later, the lack of negotiations, and the failure to benchmark, among other things.&#8221; Above all, the Delaware Court stated that we should have disclosed that Mr.&#160;Musk proposed key terms for his compensation plan in an initial call on April&#160;9, 2017, prior to discussions &#8220;among the members of the Compensation Committee.&#8221; The Delaware Court&#8217;s Decision As a result of the foregoing, the defendants bore the burden of proving that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was &#8220;entirely fair&#8221; to our stockholders. Due to the factors discussed above, the Delaware Court ruled that the compensation considered in the 2018 CEO Performance Award was more than Tesla needed to &#8220;give&#8221; in proportion to what it would &#8220;get&#8221; and thus the defendants failed to prove that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was &#8220;entirely fair&#8221; to our stockholders, and &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 81 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ordered rescission of the 2018 CEO Performance Award as a remedy. The Delaware Court found rescission equitable under the circumstances because Mr.&#160;Musk had profited from his work through his ownership of Company stock, observing that other billionaires such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett had been willing to work for nominal amounts in light of their ownership of their respective company&#8217;s stock. Performance of the Company Assessed Against Performance Metrics Tesla&#8217;s Leadership Has Revolutionized the World Tesla sets extraordinary goals and needs extraordinary leadership to achieve them. Our mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. To enact radical change requires radical innovation. Mr.&#160;Musk has led our most remarkable projects. Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership and unique vision have played critical roles in our mission and success. He has guided Tesla from an early-stage startup through multiple critical events and crises into one of the world&#8217;s leading automakers and one of the most valuable companies in the world. His innovation and vision have driven us to become the world&#8217;s first vertically integrated sustainable energy company, with a wide variety of products, from generation to storage to consumption. Under Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership, we popularized electric vehicles by making them high-performance, accessible and fun to drive. Now, electric vehicles are abundant on the streets, and in the last decade, we produced over 5.5&#160;million of our vehicles. We currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck, and, as of January&#160;24, 2024, Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the world. Importantly, our fully electric cars often replace traditional gasoline-powered cars on the road&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;tackling one of the largest global sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Mr.&#160;Musk also leads our efforts in designing, developing and manufacturing a range of cutting-edge sustainable energy generation and storage products. We offer two lithium-ion battery energy storage products&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Powerwall and Megapack. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiples of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours or greater capacity. Megapack has the potential to eliminate the need for gas peaker plants and avoid power outages. Each unit can store over 3.9 MWh of energy&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;enough energy to power an average of 3,600 homes for one hour. Through Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership, we have also developed sophisticated control software, which is utilized in the performance and safety of our vehicles and their battery packs. Our technology uses neural networks in our vehicles, and we currently offer certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and Full Self Driving (Supervised) options. We develop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles&#8217; software regularly through innovative over-the-air updates. Even with all this prior innovation, we continue to look ahead to new horizons&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Mr.&#160;Musk spearheads our efforts on products in development that we believe have the potential to be our most significant contributions. We have made incredible progress on our mission, and Mr.&#160;Musk has driven our conception, design, development, production and commercialization of these revolutionary products. Achieving such progress requires thoughtful, innovative leaders. The role of a chief executive officer is multi-faceted and demanding. A chief executive officer is not only responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of an entire company, but also developing the company&#8217;s vision and strategy, fostering innovation, representing the company and creating a culture of excellence. For a large, sophisticated company such as Tesla, our chief executive officer must be able to execute at an incredibly high level, which requires deep experience and a myriad of specialized abilities. Finding an individual who possesses such a diverse skill set and can excel in these various aspects is not easy, but Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s demonstrated track record of success has proven that he can do so. The Delaware Court in the Tornetta Opinion referred to Mr.&#160;Musk as a &#8220;Superstar CEO&#8221;. The Board and &#160; 82 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; management believe that it is in Tesla&#8217;s interest to secure Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s &#8220;Superstar CEO&#8221; talent and experience by means of appropriate compensation. With Mr.&#160;Musk leading the Company, the Board and management believe that we have fundamentally changed the world. We are proud of what the Company has achieved, but there is much more to be done, and we believe that we are best positioned to accomplish our goals with Mr.&#160;Musk at the helm and provided with ambitious targets and appropriate incentives to meet those targets. Our Compensation Is Designed to Drive Innovation and Growth In 2018, we carefully designed the 2018 CEO Performance Award to align the interests of our leaders with those of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders and to motivate them to use their talent and initiative to drive the Company&#8217;s financial performance and stockholder value. We used Compensia, a leading independent compensation consultant to help us develop the 2018 CEO Performance Award and understand how our executive compensation compares to that of our competitors. The Board and management are committed to compensating our executives both competitively and in line with their contributions to our success and the value delivered to our stockholders. Our Company would not be where it is today without Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s contributions, leadership and vision and we have an exceptionally strong interest in retaining him and motivating him to devote the time, energy, resources and skill to Tesla that is necessary to achieve the success we have achieved and the vision and strategy to which we aspire. As a result, we believe this requires a compensation plan that recognizes Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s unique role and more importantly provides the appropriate incentives for Mr.&#160;Musk not only to remain with Tesla and devote time to its business and affairs, but also to continue to bring the level of dedication to the Company that we believe is crucial to reaching the ambition we have for growing the business over the long term. In developing the 2018 CEO Performance Award, the Board obtained feedback from a broad set of our institutional stockholders and incorporated the feedback into the decision-making process. The 2018 CEO Performance Award was approved by approximately 73% of all votes cast by our disinterested stockholders under the 2018 Disinterested Standard, as well as the majority votes required under the 2018 Nasdaq Standard and the 2018 Bylaws Standard. The 2018 CEO Performance Award contained no guaranteed compensation of any kind&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no salary, no cash bonuses and no equity that vests simply through the passage of time. Since 2018, Mr.&#160;Musk has not received any of these customary forms of compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;nearly six&#160;years without salary, cash bonuses or equity grants that vest only due to the passage of time. Instead, Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s only compensation opportunity from Tesla depended on him driving Tesla&#8217;s achievement of milestones the Board believed were exceptionally challenging. The only compensation included in the 2018 CEO Performance Award was a 100% at-risk performance award upon achievement of certain performance targets, which was designed so that Mr.&#160;Musk would be compensated only if our stock price, revenue and profitability out-performed ambitious targets, resulting in value for all of our stockholders. The intention of the 2018 CEO Performance Award was to motivate Mr.&#160;Musk to devote the time, energy, resources and skill necessary to achieve extraordinary goals, well beyond what any contractual commitment to spend a set number of hours and a specified&#160;percentage of his professional time devoted to Tesla would achieve. In addition, under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr.&#160;Musk had an obligation to hold any Tesla shares obtained from exercising options under the 2018 CEO Performance Award for a period of five&#160;years after the exercise date, which was designed to address Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s economic incentives after he exercised his options. Although the key milestones under the 2018 CEO Performance Award have already been met, if the Ratification is approved by stockholders, the Company believes that Mr. Musk&#8217;s holding requirement will continue to incentivize him and align his interests with those of our other stockholders. In summary, the 2018 CEO Performance Award was high-risk, high-reward. This is a bedrock of capitalism and American innovation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the prospect of significant rewards motivates entrepreneurs to take risks, which leads to innovation and progress, driving economic growth. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 83 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Mr.&#160;Musk Met&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and Exceeded&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;His Performance Award Milestones The Board in 2018 believed that the hurdles for performance were exceptionally high, and subsequently, Mr.&#160;Musk met&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and exceeded&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;each and every key milestone in the 2018 CEO Performance Award, milestones that have resulted in remarkable value creation for our stockholders. In addition to these economic achievements, Mr.&#160;Musk has also helped grow our Company in other areas. We have nearly tripled the number of employees since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was approved. We have also made significant progress under Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership and vision on our mission to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. We are proud of the contributions we have made to the economy, the environment and the world under Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership. Not all executives achieve such success, even with similar financial milestones. Other tech executives have received equity incentive grants contingent upon specific performance targets and failed to reach them but in most cases have continued to receive other forms of compensation. The 2018 CEO Performance Award contained extraordinary goals and required extraordinary performance. Mr.&#160;Musk delivered. Matters Related to Delaware Common Law and Statutory Ratification The Company is asking its stockholders to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award under Delaware common and statutory law. Delaware common law ratification permits a Delaware corporation to validate a corporate act where the actors that purported to effect it lacked requisite corporate authority to do so. Common law ratification can also extinguish claims for breach of fiduciary duty by authorizing an act that otherwise would constitute a breach. When properly implemented, common law ratification &#8220;reaches back&#8221; to validate the challenged act as of its initial enactment. The Company believes that, under the Tornetta Opinion, the 2018 CEO Performance Award is such an act that may be ratified under Delaware common law. The Company also seeks ratification under any other legal theory or appropriate statutory provision, including but not limited to Section&#160;204 of the DGCL. The Company understands that Section 204 of the DGCL allows a Delaware corporation, by following specified procedures, to ratify a corporate act that is void or voidable due to a failure of authorization, retroactive to the date the corporate act was originally taken. Failure of authorization is defined in the statute to include the failure of an action to have been adopted in accordance with any plan to which the corporation is a party, which in this case could be the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Company believes that the Delaware Court concluded that failure to have a fully informed stockholder approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award at the 2018 Special Meeting rendered the 2018 CEO Performance Award voidable. Accordingly, the Company believes that it is subject to statutory ratification under Section&#160;204 of the DGCL. The text of Section&#160;204 of the DGCL is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex J . While the Company believes that the Ratification should be upheld by a Delaware court, the Special Committee noted that even a favorable vote by our stockholders to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award may not fully resolve the matter. The Special Committee and its advisors noted that they could not predict with certainty how a stockholder vote to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award would be treated under Delaware law in these novel circumstances. Recommendations of the Special Committee and the Board As discussed in the section &#8220; Background and Process of the Special Committee ,&#8221; the Special Committee was formed for the purpose of determining the Redomestication but its mandate was subsequently expanded to cover the Ratification as well. For a summary of the events leading up to the Special Committee&#8217;s recommendation, as well as a discussion of the Special Committee&#8217;s process, see the section under the caption &#8220; Background and Process of the Special Committee &#8221; and the full text of the Special Committee Report attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex E and incorporated by reference herein. At a meeting of the Special Committee held on April&#160;16, 2024, after reviewing and considering the factors and considerations deemed relevant by the Special Committee, and after investigating and &#160; 84 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; considering the benefits and detriments, for the reasons set forth in the Special Committee&#8217;s Report and summarized below under the caption &#8220; Reasons for the Ratification ,&#8221; the Special Committee adopted resolutions determining that Ratification is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, and that the Board should adopt appropriate ratification resolutions and seek ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award by the stockholders of the Company at the Company&#8217;s 2024 Annual Meeting. The Special Committee also recommended to the Board that (1) the Board and management take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Committee&#8217;s ratification determination consistent with legal obligations; (2) Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk be recused from the Board&#8217;s deliberations and from the vote on this matter because it concerns Mr. Musk&#8217;s compensation; (3) the stockholder vote on ratification be conditioned on approval by at least a majority of votes cast by disinterested stockholders, in the same manner as the 2018 stockholder vote; (4) the Tornetta Opinion be annexed to, and summarized in, the Company&#8217;s proxy statement; (5) the Company&#8217;s proxy statement address any other current plans regarding compensation for Mr. Musk; and (6) the Board adopt appropriate ratification resolutions and recommend that stockholders vote for ratification based on the Committee&#8217;s determination that ratifying the 2018 CEO Performance Award is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. Following the determination of the Special Committee that the Ratification is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders and the recommendations of the Special Committee, and after considering the Special Committee's determination and the Special Committee Report, the Board met on April&#160;9, 2024, April 13, 2024 and April&#160;16, 2024, with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves. On April 16, 2024, the Board determined that the Ratification is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, approved the Ratification for any purpose, directed that the Ratification be submitted for consideration by our stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting and recommended that our stockholders approve the Ratification, in accordance with Delaware statutory law, including Section 204 of the DGCL, and with Delaware common law. Practical Implications of the Ratification If the 2018 CEO Performance Award is ratified by our stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting, the Company believes that: &#8226; the deficiencies, including disclosure deficiencies, procedural deficiencies, and breaches of fiduciary duty, identified by the Delaware Court in connection with the Board and our stockholders&#8217; original approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be ratified and remedied, and any wrongs found by the Delaware Court in connection with the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be cured; &#8203; &#8226; the 303,960,630 options issued to Mr.&#160;Musk pursuant to the 2018 CEO Performance Award will be restored to Mr.&#160;Musk, compensating him for his nearly six years of service to Tesla; and &#8203; &#8226; defendants in the Tornetta case may be able to argue that Mr.&#160;Tornetta&#8217;s attorneys are not entitled to the attorneys&#8217; fee award they are requesting for the purported value conferred on the Company by the rescission of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which request includes an award of nearly 30&#160;million freely tradeable shares of our common stock, currently valued at more than $5 billion (based on the closing price of Tesla common stock on April 12, 2024). The plaintiff&#8217;s theory is that his lawsuit benefited Tesla by causing the cancellation of options issued to Mr.&#160;Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. If the 2018 CEO Performance Award is ratified, those options will be restored to Mr.&#160;Musk. As a result, Mr.&#160;Tornetta may not be considered to have rendered the &#8220;benefit&#8221; to Tesla through his lawsuit that is claimed by his attorneys. Although the Delaware Court may order some other remedy or attorneys&#8217; fees as a result of the lawsuit (assuming that Tornetta is not overturned on appeal), defendants in the Tornetta case would be able to argue that any award of attorneys&#8217; fees&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if there is any&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;should be significantly smaller than what Mr.&#160;Tornetta&#8217;s attorneys are currently seeking. &#8203; Reasons for the Ratification The determination of the Special Committee and the determination of the Board that Ratification by stockholders is in the best interest of the Company and all of its stockholders, and the decision of &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 85 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; the Special Committee to recommend to the Board that it recommend that the Company&#8217;s stockholders vote for Ratification, were the result of deliberation and consideration. The Special Committee prepared and delivered a report to the Board, and the full text of the Special Committee Report is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex E . The Special Committee Report explains the Special Committee&#8217;s reasoning for its determination and is summarized herein. The following summary of the key considerations of the Special Committee and the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Special Committee Report attached to this Proxy Statement. Stockholders are encouraged to read the full text of the Special Committee Report for additional detail regarding the analysis of the Special Committee on the proposed Ratification. Because of the nature of the ratification process, the Special Committee did not substantively re-evaluate the amount or terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and did not engage a compensation consultant. It did not negotiate with Mr.&#160;Musk. The Special Committee determined that none of those steps would have been consistent with ratification. The Special Committee noted that the Board previously decided in January&#160;2018 that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was fair, and noted that Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson was not on the Board at that time. The Special Committee further noted that the defendants in Tornetta will be appealing the ruling because they believe the compensation plan is fair and should be upheld as agreed. The Special Committee assessed only whether the 2018 CEO Performance Award, as it was previously agreed to, should be ratified by stockholders at this time based on the facts that currently exist. The Special Committee took account of and investigated a number of factors, including, among others: Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s knowledge of the Company&#8217;s compensation practices and philosophy; stockholder sentiment; potential alternatives to ratification; and Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s views on the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Committee&#8217;s decision on Ratification was grounded in several factors described below, which formed the basis for its recommendations to the Board. Stockholders Want to Speak for Themselves. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee noted that Tesla stockholders&#8217; views about their Company are important. Their views on Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation, motivation, and retention are especially important because&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as the Company&#8217;s public disclosures have said for&#160;years&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the Company is &#8220;highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk.&#8221; As a result, the Company&#8217;s relationship with Mr. Musk is a key focus of the Board&#8217;s stockholder engagement program. Since the Tornetta Opinion&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a case brought by a plaintiff who then held nine shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;many stockholders have strongly expressed support for Mr. Musk&#8217;s compensation. The Special Committee noted that dozens of institutional stockholders have, unprompted, told the Company&#8217;s Investor Relations team that they disagree with Tornetta &#8217;s invalidation of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Seven institutional stockholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including four of the top 10&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;felt strongly enough to seek a meeting with the Board Chair and raise the issue. One of those top 10 investors, T. Rowe Price, sent a follow up letter to the Board Chair reiterating its support for a new stockholder vote, excerpts of which are included in the Special Committee Report. The Special Committee noted that this issue has also galvanized many retail stockholders. More than 6,000 individuals claiming to be stockholders owning more than 23&#160;million total shares&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;equivalent to the 11th largest institutional stockholder&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sent unsolicited letters and emails to the Board or to the Tornetta court supporting the reinstatement of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s equity compensation. The Special Committee found this stockholder feedback powerful and persuasive. In its judgment, this alone justifies holding a ratification vote so that stockholders can determine whether Musk&#8217;s compensation plan is fair and in their best interests. A Ratification Vote Should Cure Tornetta&#8217;s Disclosure Criticisms. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee noted that the Tornetta decision criticizes many aspects of the negotiation process for, the substance of, and the disclosures about the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Special Committee believes that a new stockholder vote allows the disclosure deficiencies found by the Tornetta court to be corrected, among other things. Stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s 2018 &#160; 86 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; CEO Performance Award with full knowledge of everything the Tornetta decision criticized. They will also know what Mr.&#160;Musk achieved. The Special Committee is aware that the Company and the defendants in Tornetta vigorously dispute the ruling and the defendants plan to appeal it. Regardless of the decision&#8217;s merits, holding a new vote, with the Tornetta Opinion fully disclosed and attached as Annex I to this Proxy Statement, has independent value in the Special Committee&#8217;s eyes because it will remove the cloud over the 2018 vote. Our stockholders can decide for themselves if they think Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation is fair, in light of what he achieved and its impact on stockholders. Ratification Could Avoid Further Uncertainty Regarding Mr. Musk&#8217;s Compensation And Motivation. &#160;&#160;&#160; The 2018 CEO Performance Award was first approved by our stockholders in March&#160;2018. The Tornetta litigation has been pending for nearly six&#160;years, and proceedings remain ongoing in the trial court. The Special Committee noted that an appeal would take many&#160;months at the least. Ratification by our stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting could avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty regarding the Company&#8217;s most important employee. Although the Special Committee made its decision beforehand, it wanted to hear directly from Mr.&#160;Musk on this issue. It asked him whether, and why, the 2018 CEO Performance Award was important to him. Mr.&#160;Musk told the Special Committee that, like most people, he wants to be treated fairly and with respect. He said he feels that he worked extraordinarily hard, and made many sacrifices, to meet the terms of the deal that had been agreed on. He made clear that his ownership interest in Tesla is also very meaningful to him. And he confirmed that the 2018 CEO Performance Award had been motivating, and that ratification of it would motivate him to continue devoting his time and energy to Tesla. Furthermore, the Company notes that the specific provision of the 2018 CEO Performance Award requiring Mr.&#160;Musk to hold any shares of common stock obtained from exercising (not vesting) options for a period of five&#160;years after the exercise date further motivates Mr.&#160;Musk to continue devoting his time and energy to Tesla. Seeking Ratification Now Potentially Avoids A Criticism of the Redomestication Vote . &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee determined that holding a ratification vote on Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation now may take away one potential criticism of the stockholder vote on the Texas Redomestication under Proposal Three in this Proxy Statement. The Special Committee was cognizant of the possibility that its redomestication decision could be wrongly perceived as being made in direct response to the Tornetta Opinion and with the intent to award Mr. Musk compensation in a different jurisdiction that he could not get in Delaware. The Special Committee concluded that holding a ratification vote now should preclude such criticism. Seeking Ratification Now Potentially Avoids Other Costs . &#160;&#160;&#160;The Special Committee also noted that if the 2018 CEO Performance Award is not ratified, then Tesla may need to negotiate a replacement compensation plan with Mr.&#160;Musk in order to motivate him to devote his time and energy to Tesla. Negotiating a new plan would likely take substantial time in light of the criticisms in Tornetta of the process that led to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. And any new plan would, of course, require Mr.&#160;Musk to agree to the terms and amount. Although the Special Committee expressly and consciously did not negotiate (or renegotiate) with Mr.&#160;Musk about his compensation, it expects from its interview with him that, for Mr.&#160;Musk to agree to it, any new plan would need to be of a similar magnitude to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The Special Committee also concluded that there is a risk that a new compensation plan would thus have a substantially similar dilution effect as the 2018 CEO Performance Award (assuming it is equity-based rather than cash). It would likely result in a very large, incremental accounting charge for compensation expense. For illustrative purposes, the Company&#8217;s accounting team informed the Special Committee that a new grant of 300&#160;million fully vested options&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;functionally equivalent to what Mr. Musk had before the Tornetta Opinion&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;would potentially result in an accounting charge in excess of $25&#160;billion, depending on certain timing and valuation factors. According to their analysis, any replacement compensation plan would likely have to be less than 10% of the size of the 2018 CEO Performance Award to avoid a new accounting charge for compensation expense that is greater than the reversal of the 2018 charge. The Special Committee also considered the possibility that &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 87 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ratification of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s 2018 CEO Performance Award could undermine the basis for the Tornetta plaintiff&#8217;s request for an award of attorneys&#8217; fees of approximately $5&#160;billion in Tesla stock. Certain Additional Considerations and Risks Associated with the Ratification Stockholders should also consider the following considerations and risks associated with the Ratification: &#8226; This Ratification may be challenged in these novel circumstances by stockholders, both before and after the vote. It is possible that the seeking of Ratification may result in further legal expenses, delay and resource consumption beyond costs associated with solely pursuing the appeal in the Tornetta case. The Special Committee noted in its report that even a favorable Ratification vote by stockholders may not fully resolve this matter. The Special Committee and its advisors noted that they could not predict with certainty how a vote to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award would be treated under Delaware law under these novel circumstances. &#8203; &#8226; Further, stockholders may challenge our ability under Delaware law to submit the Ratification to a vote of our stockholders and may seek an injunction to prevent the Ratification from being voted upon by our stockholders at our 2024 Annual Meeting. As a result, there is a risk that stockholders seeking to express disagreement with this decision could derail the desires of a majority of the stockholders. &#8203; &#8226; Stockholders may challenge the legal effect of the Ratification, even after the stockholder vote, which means there could be subsequent challenges to and further delays of our ability to provide appropriate compensation to Mr.&#160;Musk for the 2018 to 2023 period, or that the Ratification could get subsequently overturned. Litigation relating to the Ratification, regardless of merit, may cause us to incur significant expenses. Further, if a court determines that such litigation has merit, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. &#8203; &#8226; The Delaware Court, or another court, may find that the Ratification is not fair to stockholders, even if stockholders approve the Ratification Proposal, and it may find that the process employed by the Special Committee was not adequate or fair, or that the Ratification is otherwise legally defective. &#8203; &#8226; The Delaware Court, or another court, may find that Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson was not independent with respect to the Ratification and this proposal notwithstanding the Special Committee&#8217;s determination. &#8203; &#8226; As disclosed in the Special Committee Report, the Special Committee did not seek to negotiate a new compensation package with Mr.&#160;Musk and there is no such new compensation package planned by the Company. There can be no guarantee that negotiation of such a replacement package would not have resulted in cost savings to the Company greater than the anticipated cost savings noted by the Special Committee in its report and summarized above. &#8203; &#8226; Notwithstanding the position of the Special Committee and the Board that Ratification could undermine the Tornetta plaintiff&#8217;s request for an award of legal fees of approximately $5&#160;billion in Tesla stock, there can be no guarantee that Ratification will have this effect or alter a court&#8217;s finding of the plaintiff&#8217;s entitlement to such a fee. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the request is under consideration by a court, and there can be no guarantee that the defendants in Tornetta would be successful in making such a claim. The plaintiff&#8217;s theory is that his lawsuit &#8220;benefited&#8221; Tesla by causing the cancellation of options issued to Mr.&#160;Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. If the 2018 CEO Performance Award is ratified, those options will be restored to Mr.&#160;Musk. As a result, Mr.&#160;Tornetta may not be considered to have rendered the &#8220;benefit&#8221; to Tesla through his lawsuit that is claimed by his attorneys. Although the Delaware Court may order some other remedy or attorneys&#8217; fees as a result of the lawsuit (assuming that Tornetta is not overturned on appeal), defendants in the Tornetta case would be able to argue that any award of attorneys&#8217; fees&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if there is any&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;should be significantly smaller than what Mr.&#160;Tornetta&#8217;s attorneys are currently seeking. &#8203; &#160; 88 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; In addition, stockholders should take into account the following considerations and risks associated with not ratifying the 2018 CEO Compensation Plan, including: &#8226; Mr.&#160;Musk has not received compensation in nearly six&#160;years. Mr.&#160;Musk has no active compensation plans or arrangements, or negotiations, with the Company, other than the 2018 CEO Performance Award. There is a risk that failure to ratify would further delay any compensation for the CEO, which could affect his incentive to continue devoting time and energy to Tesla, which is essential to the Company. &#8203; &#8226; As noted by the Special Committee, if the Company needed to replace Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation with similar compensation in lieu of Ratification, such amounts would likely result in significant accounting charges, for the Company. The Company has determined if Tesla were to issue new stock option awards to purchase approximately 303.96&#160;million shares of common stock, assuming no further vesting conditions or sale restrictions with the exercise price as the closing stock price of April&#160;1, 2024, which was $175.22, the accounting implication would be an incremental compensation expense in excess of $25&#160;billion, which is calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation model (assuming an expected term of five&#160;years), even when taking into account the reversal of original grant date fair value of the 2018 CEO Performance Award of approximately $2.3&#160;billion. &#8203; &#8226; While there can be no guarantee that the stockholder vote&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;either for or against the Ratification&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;will have any effect on the outcome of the Tornetta plaintiff&#8217;s request for an award of legal fees, if the Ratification vote is unsuccessful, the defendants in the Tornetta case will not be able to argue that the Ratification should have an effect on the requested legal fees. &#8203; Federal Income Tax Consequences The following discussion is a brief summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences of the 2018 CEO Performance Award under the Tax Code as in effect on the date of this proxy statement. The following summary assumes that Mr.&#160;Musk remains a U.S. taxpayer. The Tax Code and its regulations are subject to change. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe, among other things, state, local or non-U.S. income and other tax consequences. The specific tax consequences to Mr.&#160;Musk will depend upon his future individual circumstances. Tax Effect for Mr.&#160;Musk . &#160;&#160;&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk did not have taxable income from the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award nor will he have taxable income from the Ratification, if such approval occurs. If and when Mr.&#160;Musk exercises any portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, he will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (on the exercise date) of the Tesla shares purchased over the exercise price of the option. Any taxable income recognized in connection with the exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award by Mr.&#160;Musk will be subject to tax withholding by us. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares will be capital gain or loss. Tax Effect for Tesla. &#160;&#160;&#160;We will not be entitled to a material tax deduction in connection with the 2018 CEO Performance Award. In most cases, companies are entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by a participant when the participant exercises a nonstatutory stock option and recognizes such income. However, Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code limits the deductibility of compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and other &#8220;covered employees&#8221; as defined in Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code. No tax deduction is allowed for compensation paid to any covered employee to the extent that the total compensation for that executive exceeds $1,000,000 in any taxable year. Under Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code, we expect that Mr.&#160;Musk always will be a covered employee for purposes of Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code. Therefore, in any given year in which Mr.&#160;Musk exercises all or part of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we will be able to take a tax deduction of only $1,000,000 or less, regardless of the amount of compensation recognized by Mr.&#160;Musk from the exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 89 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Interests of Certain Persons Mr.&#160;Musk, our director and Chief Executive Officer, has a direct interest in the Ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award since he is the recipient. Mr.&#160;Musk has no active compensation plans or arrangements, or negotiations, with the Company, other than the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Kimbal Musk is a director of the Company and is Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s brother. Kimbal Musk has an indirect interest in the Ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award by virtue of this relationship. As a result of these interests, the Special Committee recommended and the Board determined it would be best for Mr.&#160;Musk and Kimbal Musk to recuse themselves from consideration of the Ratification. As discussed in the Special Committee Report, the Special Committee did not interview Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk until after it had reached a decision on both redomestication and ratification. However, both were interviewed in their capacities as CEO and director and director, respectively. No aspect of either of those interviews caused the Special Committee to rethink its decisions. As noted in the Tornetta decision and in various media outlets, several members of the Board have social or business connections with Mr.&#160;Musk or other Tesla directors. The Board was cognizant of the Tornetta decision in particular and determined that the directors addressed in the Tornetta decision would not be selected for the Special Committee. Further, as the mandate of the Special Committee expanded to cover Ratification, Mr.&#160;Gebbia resigned from the Special Committee due to the potential for perceived conflicts of interest, including from his relationship with Mr.&#160;Musk. This is more fully described in the Special Committee Report. The Special Committee, in conjunction with its advisors, determined that Ms.&#160;Wilson-Thompson was independent and has had no compromising personal or financial ties to Mr.&#160;Musk or any other Tesla director from her first appointment to the Board in December 2018 to today. For additional information, see the Special Committee Report. Conclusion After careful review of all of the factors, taken together, the Special Committee and the Board believe that the Ratification is in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders, and the Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the Ratification. Effect of Not Obtaining the Required Vote for Approval If the proposal to approve the Ratification fails to obtain the requisite vote for approval, the Ratification will not be approved. Required Vote We ask our stockholders to approve the Ratification. The proposal to approve the Ratification requires the following votes of Tesla&#8217;s Stockholders: (1) the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total votes of shares of Tesla common stock cast in person or by proxy at the 2024 Annual Meeting on the proposal, pursuant to the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the &#8220; NASDAQ Standard &#8221;), &#8203; and (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the 2024 Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, pursuant to Tesla&#8217;s amended and restated bylaws (the &#8220; Bylaws Standard &#8221;), &#8203; and (3) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total votes of shares of Tesla common stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk, cast in person or by proxy at the 2024 Annual Meeting on the proposal, pursuant to the resolutions of the Board approving the Ratification (the &#8220; Ratification Disinterested Standard &#8221;). &#8203; &#160; 90 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; With respect to the approval of the Ratification, you may vote &#8220;FOR&#8221;, &#8220;AGAINST&#8221; or &#8220;ABSTAIN&#8221;. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulations of voting power present and entitled to vote on the Ratification. If you vote to abstain, it will have the same effect as a vote against the Ratification under the Bylaws Standard, but will have no effect on the Ratification under the NASDAQ Standard or the Ratification Disinterested Standard. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other intermediary that is otherwise counted as present or represented by proxy does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to vote the shares. A broker non-vote will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the 2024 Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote or the votes cast with respect to a particular proposal as to which that broker non-vote occurs. Thus, a broker non-vote will impact our ability to obtain a quorum for the 2024 Annual Meeting, but will not otherwise affect the outcome of the Ratification since the proposal requires the approval of (i)&#160;a majority of the total votes of shares of Tesla common stock cast in person or by proxy on the proposal, (ii)&#160;a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal, and (iii)&#160;a majority of the total votes of shares of Tesla common stock not owned, directly or indirectly, by Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk cast in person or by proxy on the proposal. Brokers do not have discretion to vote on the proposal to approve the Ratification and broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting on the proposal. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board (with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves) recommends that stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the 100% performance-based stock option award to Mr. Musk that was proposed to and approved by our stockholders in 2018. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 91 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Five Tesla Proposal for Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm General The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements of Tesla for the fiscal year ending December&#160;31, 2024, which will include an audit of the effectiveness of Tesla&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited Tesla&#8217;s financial statements since 2005. A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is expected to be present at the meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. Stockholder ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm is a matter of good corporate practice. In the event that this selection is not ratified by the affirmative vote of a majority of voting power of the shares in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Tesla and our stockholders. Principal Accounting Fees and Services The following table presents fees billed for professional audit services and other services rendered to Tesla by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the&#160;years ended December&#160;31, 2022 and 2023. The dollar amounts in the table and accompanying footnotes are in thousands. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 2022 &#8203; &#8203; 2023 &#8203; Audit Fees (1) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 16,192 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 17,365 &#8203; &#8203; Audit-Related Fees (2) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 44 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 42 &#8203; &#8203; Tax Fees (3) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 4,442 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 2,579 &#8203; &#8203; All Other Fees (4) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 134 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 269 &#8203; &#8203; Total &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 20,812 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 20,255 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; (1) Audit Fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of Tesla&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Tesla&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K and for the review of the financial statements included in Tesla&#8217;s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as services that generally only Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably provide, including statutory audits and services rendered in connection with SEC filings. &#8203; (2) Audit-Related Fees in 2022 and 2023 consisted of fees for professional services for certain agreed upon procedures in conjunction with certain financing transactions and other attestation services. &#8203; (3) Tax Fees in 2022 and 2023 consisted of fees related to consultation, tax planning and compliance services. &#8203; (4) Other Fees in 2022 and 2023 consisted of permitted services other than those that meet the criteria above and include fees for accounting research software, the assessment of non-financial metrics and documentation and pre-implementation review of non-financial systems. &#8203; Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Tesla&#8217;s Audit Committee has adopted a policy for pre-approving audit and non-audit services and associated fees of Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm. Under this policy, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all services and associated fees provided to Tesla by its independent registered public accounting firm, with certain de minimis exceptions described in the policy. &#160; 92 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; All PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP services and fees in fiscal 2022 and 2023 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote FOR the Tesla proposal for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&#160;31, 2024. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 93 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Six Stockholder Proposal Regarding Reduction of Director Terms to One Year In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by James McRitchie. James McRitchie has informed us that he is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting. James McRitchie&#8217;s address is 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, CA 95758. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** Proposal Six: Elect Each Director Annually RESOLVED, James McRitchie, of CorpGov.net, and other Tesla Inc (&#8220; Company &#8221;) shareholders ask that our Company take all the steps necessary to reorganize the Board of Directors into one class, with each director subject to election each year for a one-year term. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Arthur Levitt, former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said, &#8220;In my view, it&#8217;s best for the investor if the entire board is elected once a year. Without annual election of each director shareholders have far less control over who represents them.&#8221; Since directors in a declassified board are elected and evaluated each year, declassification promotes responsiveness to shareholder demands and pressures directors to perform to retain their seats. Declassified boards are more likely to be diverse in nature and increase accountability and responsiveness to shareholders. More than 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies elect each director annually. Annual elections are widely viewed as a corporate governance best practice to make directors more accountable, thereby contributing to improved performance and increased company value. Shareholder resolutions by James McRitchie on this topic won 11 of 11 votes at companies since 2018, according to data compiled by Diligent, with an average vote of more than 77%. Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis both supported all such proposals. According to one of our largest shareholders, BlackRock: &#8220;Directors should be re-elected annually; classification of the board generally limits shareholders&#8217; rights to regularly evaluate a board&#8217;s performance and select directors.&#8221; Vanguard generally votes for proposals to declassify an existing board and votes against management or shareholder proposals to create a classified board. According to Equilar, &#8220;A classified board creates concern among shareholders because poorly performing directors may benefit from an electoral reprieve. Moreover, a fraternal atmosphere may form from a staggered board that favors the interests of management above those of shareholders. Since directors in a declassified board are elected and evaluated each year, declassification promotes responsiveness to shareholder demands and pressures directors to perform to retain their seat.&#8221; This proposal should also be evaluated in the context of our Company&#8217;s overall corporate governance as of the date of this submission: Shareholders cannot call special meetings, act by written consent, or modify various bylaws without at least 66 and 2/3% of the voting power of outstanding stock. Our Company&#8217;s technology is second to none. Our Company&#8217;s corporate governance should meet the same high standards. Increase Long-Term Shareholder Value Vote FOR Elect Each Director Annually&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Proposal 6 *** &#160; 94 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and has determined that it would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders. Tesla&#8217;s mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. This mission continues to require a long-term focus that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our stockholders, and we face the risk of distractions posed by special interests that seek only short-term returns. At the same time, the Board continuously evaluates our corporate governance structure, practices and policies, and also weighs feedback from our stockholders as well as the stockholder proposals we have historically received for our annual meetings of stockholders. The stockholder proponent&#8217;s main justification in proposing Board declassification is to increase director accountability and responsiveness to stockholders. This fails to account for a history of stockholder engagement and responsiveness to stockholder proposals by our Board, which includes: amending the bylaws of the Company to enable proxy access, and recommending management proposals in past years to reduce director terms and eliminate applicable supermajority voting requirements. Our Board maintains an active, year-round dialogue with our stockholders and is committed to supporting our efforts to enhance engagement. As such, we do not believe declassifying the Board would serve to enhance the robust process we are already currently undertaking. As the stockholder proponent acknowledges, our current Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws require the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 &#8725; 3 % of the total outstanding shares entitled to vote in order to approve an amendment to reduce the terms of our directors. Without achieving the required stockholder participation rate, the Board would not have the authority to implement declassification even if it wished to do so. As disclosed in our 2023 Proxy Statement, the Board has determined that, once we have achieved a total stockholder participation rate of at least 65% at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again propose Certification of Incorporation and Bylaw amendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. To the extent such proposal to eliminate supermajority voting requirements achieves the required threshold to pass, it will unlock a gateway for our Board and stockholders to adopt further stockholder-driven governance actions, including, without limitation, the declassification of the Board. As a result, because our Board has already shown through its actions its responsiveness to stockholders and commitment to a governance framework that we believe will ultimately maximize value to our stockholders, our Board recommends against this proposal. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding reduction of director terms to one year. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 95 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Seven Stockholder Proposal Regarding Simple Majority Voting Provisions in Our Governing Documents In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by John Chevedden. John Chevedden has informed us that he is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting. John Chevedden&#8217;s address is 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** Proposal Seven: Simple Majority Vote Shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes in plain English. Shareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to &#8220;What Matters in Corporate Governance&#8221; by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements like those at Marathon Petroleum are used to block corporate governance improvements supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management. This proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy&#8217;s. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG). This proposal topic was approved by more than a majority of Tesla shareholders at the 2020 Tesla annual meeting. Thus it should have been adopted in 2020. The responsibility for this proposal topic not being adopted now falls on Mr.&#160;Ira Ehrenpreis who chairs the Tesla Corporate Governance Committee. Shareholders can vote against Mr.&#160;Ehrenpreis as a sign that they are impatient in regard to the long overdue adoption of this proposal topic. Please vote yes: Simple Majority Vote&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Proposal 7 *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board recommends a vote against this proposal. Proposals relating to adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate applicable supermajority voting requirements have previously been put forth for vote at &#160; 96 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; prior Tesla annual meetings of stockholders, most recently in 2022. However, such proposals have failed to pass each time. Because the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 &#8725; 3 % of the total outstanding shares entitled to vote is required to approve such amendments, such proposals cannot pass unless we achieve such a stockholder participation rate. Accordingly, as disclosed in the proxy materials distributed in connection with the Company&#8217;s 2023 annual meeting of stockholders (the &#8220; 2023 Proxy Statement &#8221;), the Board determined that once we have achieved a total stockholder participation rate of at least 65% at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again propose certificate of incorporation and bylaw amendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. The stockholder proponent stated that, because &#8220;this proposal topic was approved by more than a majority of Tesla stockholders at the 2020 annual meeting &#8230; it should have been adopted in 2020.&#8221; This statement is inaccurate and demonstrates a substantial lack of understanding not only of governance and Tesla&#8217;s governing documents, but also of our prior actions and disclosures. In fact, following the simple majority approval of the similar 2020 proposal, Tesla put forth a proposal for adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate applicable supermajority voting requirements in our 2021 proxy statement. Therefore, the actions of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and its Chair, Ira Ehrenpreis, and the Board, were appropriately responsive to the majority-supported 2020 proposal, and stockholder were asked to vote on the matter. However, the 2021 management proposal to amend the certificate of incorporation failed to achieve the requisite affirmative vote of at least 66 2 &#8725; 3 % of the total outstanding shares entitled to vote (our stockholder) and thus could not be validly adopted. Accordingly, the current proposal is factually incorrect and misleading in its characterization of our Board&#8217;s governance and prior actions. As previously disclosed in our 2023 Proxy Statement, once we have achieved the threshold participation rate at a stockholder meeting, the Board will again propose certificate of incorporation and bylaw amendments to eliminate supermajority voting requirements. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal for simple majority voting provisions in our governing documents. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 97 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Eight Stockholder Proposal Regarding Annual Reporting on Anti-Harassment and Discrimination Efforts In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by the Comptroller of the State of New York, which is the Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund (the &#8220; Fund &#8221;) and the Administrative Head of the New York State and Local Retirement System. The Comptroller of the State of New York has informed us that the Fund is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting through its designee. The Fund&#8217;s address is 110 State Street, 14 th Floor, Albany, NY 12236. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** Resolved , Shareholders request the Board of Directors oversee the preparation of an annual public report describing and quantifying the effectiveness and outcomes of Tesla, Inc.&#8217;s (Tesla) efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination against its protected classes of employees. In its discretion, the Board may wish to consider including disclosures such as: &#8226; the total number and aggregate dollar amount of disputes settled by the company related to abuse, harassment or discrimination in the previous three&#160;years; &#8203; &#8226; the total number of pending harassment or discrimination complaints the company is seeking to resolve through internal processes, arbitration, or litigation; &#8203; &#8226; the retention rates of employees who raise harassment or discrimination concerns, relative to total workforce retention; &#8203; &#8226; the aggregate dollar amount associated with the enforcement of arbitration clauses; &#8203; &#8226; the number of enforceable contracts for current or past employees which include concealment clauses, such as non-disclosure agreements or arbitration requirements, that restrict discussions of harassment or discrimination; and &#8203; &#8226; the aggregate dollar amount associated with agreements containing concealment clauses. &#8203; This report should not include the names of accusers or details of their settlements without their consent and should be prepared at a reasonable cost and omit any information that is proprietary, privileged, or violative of contractual obligations. Supporting Statement Tesla states &#8220;Tesla has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment of any kind, and we have always disciplined and terminated employees who engage in misconduct, including those who use racial slurs or harass others in different ways.&#8221; (1) Yet, there have been numerous serious allegations of racial or sexual harassment and discrimination at Tesla. As of November&#160;21, 2023, these include, but are not limited to: &#8226; The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit claiming that, Black employees at Tesla&#8217;s Fremont, California, manufacturing facilities &#8220;have routinely endured racial abuse, pervasive stereotyping, and hostility.&#8221; (2) &#8203; &#8226; 240 Black factory workers have filed testimonies in California&#8217;s Alameda County Superior Court seeking class action status for alleged racial discrimination.

(4) &#8203; There have been several high-profile derivative suits settled including at Twentieth Century Fox, Wynn Resorts, and Alphabet, alleging boards breached their duties by failing to protect employees from discrimination and harassment, injuring the companies and their shareholders. Civil rights violations within the workplace can result in substantial costs to companies, including fines and penalties, legal costs, costs related to absenteeism, reduced productivity, challenges recruiting, and distraction of leadership. A company&#8217;s failure to properly manage its workforce can have significant ramifications, jeopardizing relationships with customers and other partners. A public report such as the one requested would assist shareholders in assessing whether the Company is improving its workforce management. *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders, as the Company is already addressing the issues targeted by the proposal, and the reporting requested by the stockholder proponent would lead to confusion rather than drive stockholder value. Tesla&#8217;s goal is to create an environment where people enjoy coming to work every day. We believe that it is essential to provide all employees, world-wide, with a respectful and safe working environment where all employees can achieve their potential. As a result we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation or any mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations. Our policies and practices are codified in our Code of Business Ethics as well as our Employee Guidebook. In addition, our Compensation Committee reviews and oversees human capital management practices relating to our employees. Our commitment to a safe workplace begins with training and prevention. We require every employee to review and acknowledge our Code of Business Ethics and Policy Against Discrimination &amp; Harassment in the Workplace, and they are required to participate in an in-depth and interactive anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training. Anti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees and reoccurring for leaders and other employees. Collectively, this ensures that all employees understand how to create and promote a respectful workplace, assess potential situations sooner and escalate appropriately. In addition, we run various leadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders&#8217; skills, and in particular, helping them to understand how to appropriately respond to and address employee concerns. While our goal is always prevention, reported complaints of discrimination and harassment are promptly investigated and, if substantiated, subject to appropriate remedial measures up to and including termination. We have a dedicated team of Employee Relations partners who conduct impartial investigations into employee concerns and support overall positive workforce engagement. We encourage employees to raise concerns internally or externally. An employee can raise concerns or complaints to any member of management, Human Resources or Employee Relations. If they prefer to report another way, our Integrity Line is available to every employee globally, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Integrity Line allows employees to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation. Human Resources, together with Employee Relations, will ensure that employee concerns are investigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. We believe that the information requested by the stockholder proponent would not assist our stockholders in assessing whether we are improving our workforce management, but rather drive confusion and misunderstanding. We remain committed to creating and maintaining a respectful and inclusive workplace, and the steps we have taken to prevent and address harassment and &#8203; (4) https://qz.com/2126548/why-is-california-suing-tesla/ &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 99 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; discrimination throughout our workforce, and will continue to challenge and defend ourselves against any allegations to the contrary. We believe that our active Board oversight, existing policies and dedicated team effectively address the issues targeted by this proposal. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding annual reporting on anti-harassment and discrimination efforts. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 100 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Nine Stockholder Proposal Regarding Adoption of a Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining Policy In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by SOC Investment Group. SOC Investment Group has informed us that it is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting. SOC Investment Group&#8217;s address is 1900 L Street NW, Suite 900, Washington, D.C. 20036. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** RESOLVED , the Board of Directors of Tesla, Inc. shall adopt and disclose a Non-interference Policy (&#8220; Policy &#8221;) upholding the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in its operations, as reflected in the International Labour Organization&#8217;s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (&#8220; Fundamental Principles &#8221;). The Policy should contain a commitment to: &#8226; Non-interference when employees seek to form or join a trade union, and a prohibition against acting to undermine this right or pressure employees not to form or join a trade union; &#8203; &#8226; Good faith and timely collective bargaining if employees form or join a trade union; &#8203; &#8226; Uphold the highest standard where national or local law differs from international human rights standards; and &#8203; &#8226; Define processes to identify, prevent, account for, and remedy practices that violate or are inconsistent with the Policy. &#8203; SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Freedom of association and collective bargaining are fundamental human rights protected by international standards including the Fundamental Principles, United Nation&#8217;s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the United Nation&#8217;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. According to the International Labour Organization, &#8220;Freedom of association refers to the right of workers &#8230; to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference.&#8221; (1) In some localities, the guidance outlined in these principles may be more stringent than national law. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights asserts &#8220;&#8230;where national laws and regulations offer a level of human rights protection that falls short of internationally recognized human rights standards, enterprises should operate to the higher standard.&#8221; (2) Tesla&#8217;s policies lack clarity on this point. Tesla&#8217;s Business Code of Ethics states that &#8220;Tesla is committed to upholding and respecting all internationally recognized human rights,&#8221; but Tesla&#8217;s Global Human Rights Policy undermines this commitment by stating that Tesla respects labor rights &#8220;In conformance with local law,&#8221; notably leaving out the commitment to any more stringent international standards. Adopting the Policy will clarify to workers and other stakeholders that Tesla will adhere to the higher standard and avoid any real or perceived conclusion otherwise. Tesla has been accused of interfering with workers&#8217; rights in recent proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board (&#8220; Labor Board &#8221;). As of December&#160;2023, the Labor Board has ruled against &#8203; (1) https://www.ilo.org/actrav/events/WCMS315488/lang-en/lndex.htm &#8203; (2) https://studylib.net/doc/8645493/the-corporate-responslbilitv-to-respect-human-rights &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 101 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Tesla in several cases; others are pending. (3) In 2021, the Labor Board upheld a ruling that Tesla illegally fired a worker in retaliation for union organizing, and illegally threatened workers regarding unionization. (4) In Sweden, Tesla faces an expanding number of solidarity strikes after refusing to sign a collective agreement with mechanics represented by IF Metall. Such reports represent material reputational and operational risks to Tesla&#8217;s shareholders. Workers&#8217; ability to exercise their labor rights can also have positive outcomes for companies and investors. Unionization has been shown to support an equitable and inclusive workplace, decrease turnover, improve health and safety, boost innovation, and strengthen responsible business conduct. (5) *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders, as the Company is already committed to protecting its employees&#8217; rights. The ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of promoting a sustainable future. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation&#8217;s Universal Declaration for Human Rights (UDHR). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect and equality, without discrimination, and recognizes the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Our commitment to human rights is so deeply ingrained in our values that we also require all of our suppliers to follow our Supplier Code of Conduct, which mandates our suppliers to respect the right of all workers to form and join trade unions of their own choosing, to bargain collectively, to engage in peaceful assembly, as well as respect the right of workers to refrain from such activities. Our suppliers must allow workers and/or their representatives to be able to openly communicate and share ideas and concerns with management regarding working conditions and management practices without fear of discrimination, reprisal, intimidation or harassment. We have more than 140,000&#160;employees worldwide, and we comply with all applicable local laws related to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and respect internationally recognized human rights in all the areas we operate. Our Global Human Rights Policy specifically sets forth that &#8220;Tesla respects the right of workers to form and join trade unions of their own choosing . . . to bargain collectively, and to engage in peaceful assembly as well as respect the right of workers to refrain from such activities.&#8221; In Germany, we have established a works council which advocates for employees and acts similarly to a union. In the US, we share information with employees on their rights under the National Labor Relations Act and we provide every manager training on employee rights, including the freedom of association. Along with our policies and the actions we have taken to protect our employees&#8217; rights, we also provide our employees multiple methods to report any concerns or grievances. Tesla has been built upon a culture of open communication, and employees have the right to freely discuss their wages, benefits and terms and conditions of employment. They also have the ability to raise complaints internally or externally. We encourage employees to bring any concerns or grievances they may have to any member of management or their HR partner. We also operate an Integrity Line, which is available 24&#160;hours a day, seven days a week, for employees to anonymously report concerns without fear of retaliation. In addition, our global Take Charge program enables employees to report issues and suggestions on safety, security and work practices, with the option to report anonymously. All issues and suggestions are responded to and tracked to closure. HR and management routinely conduct roundtables with employees, to understand employee painpoints &#8203; (3) https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/01/elon-musk-broke-law-with-threat-to-tesla-workers-stock-options-court-rules; https://www.reuters.com/buslness/autos-transportation/tesla-broke-us-labor-law-by-silencing-workers-official-rules-2023-04-26/ &#8203; (4) https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/business/musk-labor-board.html &#8203; (5) https://www.ipa-involve.com/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=e0209cd6-05d5-414a-ac22-c1d61af403f7 https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/ &#8203; &#8201;&#8212;&#8201;dgreports/ &#8203; &#8201;&#8212;&#8201;dcomm/ &#8203; &#8201;&#8212;&#8201;publ/documents/publication/ &#8203; wcms_842807.pdf https://www.theglobaIdeal.com/resources/The%20Business%20Case%20for%20Social%20Dialogue_FlNAL.pdf; https://www.oecd.org/employment/negotiating-our-way-up-1fd2da34-en.htm &#8203; &#160; 102 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; and barriers, impacting their ability to complete operational goals. These direct feedback mechanisms allow employees to be involved in shaping their workplace and supports agile decision making from leadership to address their requests or concerns. A talented and engaged workforce is central to our mission to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. In order to recruit and retain this workforce, Tesla is committed to, among other things, regular and meaningful engagement with our employees, a robust culture of safety and highly competitive compensation programs. We offer wages and benefits that meet or exceed those of other comparable manufacturing jobs in the regions where we operate, and we recently increased our base pay even further for much of our workforce. In addition, unlike other manufacturers, the vast majority of our employees have the opportunity of receiving equity, which can result in significantly higher compensation beyond our already industry-competitive total compensation. We believe our policy and actions speak for themselves and our commitment to our employees. The stockholder proponent cites to the United Nations as an international standard, and as stated above, we already endorse the UDHR in our practices. Rather than looking at Tesla&#8217;s commitment and actions, the stockholder proponent only desires Tesla to expend resources to create and maintain a policy framework and additional administrative bureaucracy set to the stockholder proponent&#8217;s own standards. This will not meaningfully alter Tesla&#8217;s commitment to human rights, nor create additional benefits to our employees or value for our stockholder. Therefore, as we believe that we have already included adequate disclosure with respect to employee rights, are actively engaged in protecting these rights, and have devoted substantial resources to creating a healthy culture, we do not believe in implementing this proposal. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding adoption of a freedom of association and collective bargaining policy. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 103 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Ten Stockholder Proposal Regarding Reporting on Effects and Risks Associated with Electromagnetic Radiation and Wireless Technologies In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by Lendri Purcell. Ms.&#160;Purcell has informed us that she is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Ms.&#160;Purcell&#8217;s address is 617 Galland Street, Petaluma, CA 94952. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** RESOLVED, Shareholders request that Tesla Board issue a report, at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary information, on the health effects and financial and competitive risks associated with electromagnetic radiation and wireless technologies embedded in its vehicles. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Proponent suggests the report include independent expert test results of magnetic fields and RF radiation for each Tesla vehicle model inside and outside of the vehicles. Shareholders request that Tesla measure the magnetic fields and RF radiation inside and outside of its vehicles and issue an annual report on the health effects and financial and competitive risks associated with electromagnetic radiation and wireless technologies embedded in its vehicles. Whereas : Tesla dedicates itself to being the safest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. The FCC has not materially updated its wireless radiofrequency (RF) radiation emissions guidelines since 1996 despite the ubiquity of human exposures in everything from our modems, devices and vehicles. Over the past 27&#160;years, growing peer reviewed published scientific evidence (1)(2)(3) links RF radiation and other non-ionizing electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure to a range of harmful effects at legally allowed levels including cancer (4) , memory damage (5) , impacts on brain development (6) , the endocrine system (7) , thyroid function (8) , reproduction (9) , and DNA/genetic damage. (10)(11) Numerous scientists conclude that the WHO&#8217;s International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO/IARC) classification of radiofrequency radiation or RF should be at least a probable, if not a proven human carcinogen. (12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17) Researchers have also documented harm to flora and fauna.

(21)(22) Shareholders have a right to be concerned about what financial risks are associated with wireless technologies. I am reaching out as a concerned shareholder, parent, consumer, and environmental health advocate to request that you review the liabilities associated with electric and magnetic fields and radiofrequency exposure in your electric vehicles. Although I can afford it, I am personally driving a 2017 Chevy Bolt with very low EMF exposures because I am reluctant to upgrade to a Tesla which has much higher EMF levels. Tesla can make some simple and cost effective measures to reduce EMF exposures to drivers and passengers. An example would be that All vehicle wireless equipment and systems (GPS, navigation system, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, sensors, etc.) installed by the manufacturer must include dashboard functionality for both reducing wireless transmissions, and turning wireless antennas and other RF emitters completely off. Magnetic fields from the electrical equipment can be shielded from passengers. RF and magnetic field levels could be measured and shared with consumers. Educated consumers are increasingly looking for safer and less toxic vehicles. As you work to reduce Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) off gassing and other environmental health measures, Tesla can compete in offering customers reduced magnetic fields and radiofrequency radiation exposures. *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and determined that the proposal would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders, as Tesla is already deeply dedicated to the safety of its products, and the reporting requested by the stockholder proponent would divert the Company&#8217;s resources and not drive stockholder value. At Tesla, safety is at the core of our product design. While our vehicles are known for their safety from a collision standpoint, earning top ratings from various government entities across four continents, we also strive to make sure that our products are safe during the course of ordinary use, including with respect to the electromagnetic and radio frequency (RF) radiation of our vehicles and the wireless components incorporated into them. For example, we have a dedicated team ensuring compliance of our wireless components with FCC standards. All our radio components (like Bluetooth, sensors, Wi-Fi and cellular components) are tested by third-parties accredited by the FCC and all components are within the limits set by the FCC. In fact, the Tesla owner&#8217;s manual lists the FCC and ISED Certifications of the radio components in our vehicles, and reports of the tests conducted by the FCC-accredited third parties and the component certifications are publicly available on the FCC&#8217;s website. Our vehicles also comply with regulatory requirements relating to electromagnetic emissions such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulation&#160;10. In addition, in designing our vehicles, we exceed regulatory requirements by taking into account the guidelines relating to the protection of humans exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as set forth by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection&#8217;s RF EMF Guidelines 2020; our vehicles are well within such guidelines. In support of their proposal, the proponent states that &#8220;[t]he FCC has not materially updated its wireless radiofrequency (RF) radiation emission guidelines since 1996 despite the ubiquity of human exposure in everything from our modems, devices and vehicles&#8221; implying that the FCC has ignored the technological changes of the past 28&#160;years. This statement is misleading. In fact as recently as 2019, the FCC requested guidance from the FDA on standards relating to RF exposure as new &#8203; (21) https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/Swiss-Re-SONAR-Publication-2019-excerpt-1.pdf &#8203; (22) https://www.ambest.com/directories/bestconnect/EmergingRisks.pdf &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 105 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; technologies are introduced, including 5G. (1) The FDA responded, &#8220;we have reviewed the result and conclusions of the recently published . . . study . . . in the context of all available scientific information . . . and concluded that no changes to the current standards are warranted at this time.&#8221; (2) The FDA further added, &#8220;the available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits&#8221;. Further, in its current consumer guides, the FCC states, &#8220;[w]hile these assertions [suggestions that wireless device use may be linked to cancer and other illnesses] have gained increased public attention, currently no scientific evidence establishes a causal link between wireless device use and cancer or other illnesses . . . at this time, there is no basis on which to establish a different safety threshold than our current requirements (3) .&#8221; Finally, in 2020, the FCC updated its guidelines to amend its RF exposure evaluation procedures and mitigation measures to help ensure compliance with existing exposure limits (4) . Thus, the FCC guidelines have not been materially updated not because of a failure to take into account new technologies or risks as the proponent suggests, but rather, because there has been a reasoned conclusion that changes to the exposure limits thus far have not been warranted. Further, the proponent also argues that the insurance industry views the risk of wireless radiation exposure is rated a &#8220;high&#8221; risk/impact, citing two publications which purport to support this view. However, the proponent&#8217;s statement is misleading, as it fails to note that the potential concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and espionage, rather than solely emissions concerns, are factors driving the risk profile attributed by insurers to the general emergence of wireless and 5G technologies. For the reasons stated above, the Board feels strongly that the requested report would be an unnecessary diversion of the Company&#8217;s resources with no corresponding benefit to Tesla, our stockholders or consumers. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding reporting on effects and risks associated with electromagnetic radiation and wireless technologies. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; (1) Letter from the FDA to the FCC on Radiofrequency Exposure (https://www.fda.gov/media/135022/ &#8203; download?attachment) &#8203; (2) Ibid. &#8203; (3) Wireless Devices and Health Concerns | Federal Communications Commission (fcc.gov) (https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns &#8203; (4) 2020-02745.pdf (govinfo.gov) &#8203; &#160; 106 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Eleven Stockholder Proposal Regarding Adopting Targets and Reporting on Metrics to Assess the Feasibility of Integrating Sustainability Metrics into Senior Executive Compensation Plans In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by Tulipshare Securities Limited.

Tulipshare Securities Limited address is 15 Exchange Place, Suite 1010, Jersey City, NJ 07302. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** Resolved: Shareholders request that, within one year, the Board Compensation Committee adopt targets and publicly report quantitative metrics appropriate to assessing the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics, including metrics regarding diversity among senior executives, into performance measures or vesting conditions that may apply to senior executives under the Company&#8217;s compensation plans or arrangements. Supporting Statement: In the Board&#8217;s discretion we recommend Tesla&#8217;s report include: &#8226; Specific performance metrics aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. These metrics should assess Tesla&#8217;s success in preventing and mitigating human rights risks across its value chain. &#8203; &#8226; Robust and comprehensive human rights due diligence process, applying the principles of the UN Guiding Principles. This process should be integrated into Tesla&#8217;s decision-making, risk assessment, and operational practices to identify, prevent, and address potential human rights impacts. &#8203; &#8226; A performance-based component in the executive compensation structure directly tied to the achievement of the established human rights and performance metrics. This linkage will incentivize the Board to lead Tesla in embedding human rights considerations into the core of its operations. &#8203; Whereas: The integration of sustainability metrics into executive compensation can enhance transparency, promote responsible corporate citizenship, and ensure that Tesla remains at the forefront of sustainable business practices. Numerous leading companies have recognized the importance of integrating sustainability metrics into executive compensation. The Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board report on the growing trend of companies incorporating sustainability criteria into performance evaluations and compensation structures. By following industry best practices, Tesla can demonstrate its commitment to sustainability leadership. Workers and investors alike are increasingly rejecting excessive executive compensation as &#8220;roughly two dozen major U.S. companies have rejected generous executive-pay packages in shareholder votes in the past year, balking at the massive pay gaps between chief executives and workers.&#8221; (1) Companies are &#8220;embracing different approaches to factoring ESG into executive pay.&#8221; (2) This trend of increasing corporate focus on sustainability metrics stands in stark contrast to Tesla CEO Musk&#8217;s claim that ESG is a &#8220;scam.&#8221; (3) Legal and reputational risks have already materialized for Tesla in the form of shareholder lawsuits. In 2023, Tesla&#8217;s directors were ordered to &#8220;return $735&#160;million to the company to settle claims &#8203; (1) https://time.com/6184355/ceo-pay-investors-workers/ &#8203; (2) https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/27/linking-executive-compensation-to-esg-performance/ &#8203; (3) https://time.com/6180638/tesla-esg-index-musk/ &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 107 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; they grossly overpaid themselves in one of the largest shareholder settlements of its kind.&#8221; (4) Musk&#8217;s $56&#160;billion executive compensation plan has &#8220;helped lift the ceiling on CEO pay&#8221; and widened the gap between workers and top executives&#8217; pay packages, according to The New York Times. (5) Moreover, the Economic Policy Institute equated Musk&#8217;s realized compensation to roughly 1,000 times the average pay of other large-company CEOs. (6) Musk&#8217;s $56&#160;billion executive pay package was challenged separately by a Tesla shareholder under a claim of unjust enrichment. (7) Given that inflows into sustainable funds rose from $5&#160;billion in 2018 to nearly $70&#160;billion in 2021, (8) Musk&#8217;s criticism of ESG does not negate the fact that Tesla needs to increase transparency and accountability on sustainability performance to ensure future shareholder value. *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders. The proposal is unnecessarily duplicative and redundant to Tesla&#8217;s existing disclosures and commitments to sustainability. Tesla&#8217;s mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy, and our senior executive compensation plans serve to motivate achievement of this mission. We believe that true &#8220;sustainability&#8221; is not achieved through simply an image of action, producing reports or tying confused metrics to compensation plans. Rather, it is done through actions which have created visible, substantive changes. Every vehicle we sell, battery we install and solar panel we add moves the needle in the direction of sustainable future. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Moreover, these programs increasingly emphasize for our executive officers the grant of stock option awards, which have zero initial value and the increase in value of which is directly tied to the creation of sustainable stockholder value. The report the proposal seeks to impose on Tesla would not further the sustainability mission that we have set forth; rather it would likely impede our mission by diverting resources. Additionally, Tesla already discloses the information the stockholder proponent seeks. For example: the stockholder proponent requests that we &#8220;apply the principles of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.&#8221; In our publicly available Global Human Rights Policy, we cite to these principles multiple times, including &#8220;We . . . utilize the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.&#8221; Further on, we disclose &#8220;In fulfilling our responsibility to respect human rights, we are committed to implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We conduct human rights due diligence to identify risks and work to mitigate them,&#8221; and &#8220;As recommended by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we commit to transparent reporting about our efforts and progress.&#8221; We do not believe any benefit could be derived for the Company or its stockholders to produce yet another report with the same statements. Tesla&#8217;s annual Impact Report also provides additional information on how human rights values are respected in our operations. Protecting human rights is core to Tesla&#8217;s procurement strategy, and we have established and implemented a supply chain due diligence management system aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Countries. We are one of the few downstream companies that publicly report through our Impact Report on how we follow each of the five steps set out in the Guidance, including how we identify (including through audits) and mitigate risks. &#8203; (4) https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-directors-settle-lawsuit-over-compensation-735-mln-2023-07-17/ &#8203; (5) https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/business/highest-paid-ceos-elon-musk.html &#8203; (6) https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2021/ &#8203; (7) https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-hear-final-arguments-trial-over-musks-56-bln-tesla-pay-2023-02-21/ &#8203; (8) https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/does-esg-really-matter-and-why &#8203; &#160; 108 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; In light of the foregoing, we believe the proposal would hurt the interests of Tesla and our stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding adopting targets and reporting on metrics to assess the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics into senior executive compensation plans. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 109 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Proposal Twelve Stockholder Proposal Regarding Committing to a Moratorium on Sourcing Minerals from Deep Sea Mining In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth a stockholder proposal, along with a supporting statement, exactly as submitted by As You Sow. As You Sow has informed us that it is the beneficial owner of more than 100 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock and intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting. As You Sow&#8217;s address is 2020 Milvia St., Suite 500, Berkeley, CA 94704. The stockholder proposal will be required to be voted upon at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement *** WHEREAS : The deep sea contains many of the planet&#8217;s intact ecosystems and plays a crucial role in regulating the climate. (1) Studies indicate that mining this underexplored and complex area for battery- related minerals will create irreversible habitat and ecosystem loss and could permanently destroy invaluable carbon storage. (2) Deep sea mining (DSM) can obliterate sea floor life through dredging, while releasing sediment plumes laced with toxic metals, poisoning marine food chains. (3) Deep sea organisms are slow-growing and fragile, and habitats can require millennia to recover from disturbances. (4) The likely outcomes of DSM include biodiversity loss and jeopardized fish-based livelihoods and food supplies. (5) Further, industrial- scale exploitation of the seafloor could have grave consequences for the ability of the oceans&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one of the planet&#8217;s biggest carbon sinks&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to absorb carbon dioxide, and may even lead to release of carbon stores. (6) Scientists warn that DSM, even done cautiously, could be devastating. The scientific uncertainty and potential catastrophic impacts of DSM have led many civil society groups, including governments, private organizations, and manufacturers to voice concern. Twenty-four governments have put in place a ban, moratorium, or precautionary pause on DSM. (7) Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers including BMW, Volvo, Volkswagen, Rivian, and Renault have committed to a global moratorium on deep sea mining, pledging to keep their supply chains deep sea mineral free until scientific findings are sufficient to assess the environmental risks of DSM. (8) Peers adopting the moratorium underscores the precautionary principle and the availability of more sustainable methods to obtain necessary materials. For example, the BMW Group emphasizes that &#8220;its sustainability strategy is also relying more on resource-efficient closed-loop material cycles&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;with the aim of significantly increasing the&#160;percentage of secondary material in vehicles.&#8221; (9) Unlike its peers, Tesla has not supported a DSM moratorium, leaving shareholders concerned that the Company is not addressing the serious reputational and regulatory risks of DSM. The supply of deep sea minerals is also legally, technologically, and financially insecure, making it expensive and &#8203; (1) https://climatesociety.ei.columbia.edu/news/rolling-deep-climate-change-and-deep-sea-ecosystems &#8203; (2) https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Harmful-Marine-Extractives-Deep-Sea-Mining.pdf; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00165/full &#8203; (3) https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/deep-sea-mining &#8203; (4) https://www.fauna-flora.org/explained/depth-deep-seabed-mining-not-answer-climate-crisis/, p.17,26 &#8203; (5) https://www.nature.com/articles/s44183-023-00016-8 &#8203; (6) https://www.fauna-flora.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fauna-flora-deep-sea-mining-update-report-march-23.pdf, p. 18 &#8203; (7) https://savethehighseas.org/voices-calling-for-a-moratorium-governments-and-parliamentarians/ &#8203; (8) https://www.stopdeepseabedmining.org/endorsers/ &#8203; (9) https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0328790EN/bmw-group-protects-the-deep-seas &#8203; &#160; 110 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; risky for Tesla to incorporate deep sea sourced minerals into its supply chain. (10) DSM is also at odds with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. (11) By committing to a global moratorium on DSM and an ocean mineral free supply chain, Tesla will join the ranks of Google, Samsung, Microsoft, Salesforce, Philips, and its EV peers by protecting a critical ecosystem and reaffirming its commitment to responsible sourcing. RESOLVED : Shareholders request that Tesla commit to a moratorium on sourcing minerals from deep sea mining, consistent with the principles announced in the Business Statement Supporting a Moratorium on Deep Sea Mining. SUPPORTING STATEMENT : If Tesla cannot so commit, shareholders request that the Board disclose its rationale and assess the Company&#8217;s anticipated need for deep sea materials. *** Opposing Statement of the Board The Board has considered this proposal and determined that it would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders. We are committed to protecting the environment and maximizing the positive impact of our supply chain for people and the planet as we accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. We source responsibly according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains and Responsible Business Conduct, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In doing this, we set forth clear expectations for our suppliers, including through our Responsible Sourcing Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct. At the same time, our supplier relationships are inherently complex, and decisions by Company management regarding the entry into agreements with suppliers for the purchase of raw materials, the availability of raw materials particularly during periods of significant supply chain disruption or uncertainty, the timing of such agreements and decisions under those agreements are fundamental to our ability to operate nimbly on a day-to-day basis while adhering to high responsible sourcing expectations. For example: for the past five&#160;years, we have reviewed scientific studies related to deep-sea mining, engaged with researchers and participated in multi-stakeholder forums to build an understanding of this issue internally to inform decision-making. The Company&#8217;s management, rather than the stockholder proponent, is in the best place to make informed and specific decisions based on its specialized expertise and judgment, while continuing to align with industry best practices and committing to responsible sourcing. In light of the foregoing reasons, we believe the proposal would not serve the best interests of Tesla or our stockholders. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding committing to a moratorium on sourcing minerals from deep sea mining. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; (10) https://ejfoundation.org/news-media/environmentalists-warn-investors-of-deep-sea-mining-risk; https://www.financeforbiodiversity.org/leading-financial-institutions-call-on-governments-to-not-permit-deep-sea-mining/ &#8203; (11) https://dsm-campaign.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Precautionary-Principle-Deep-Sea-Mining.pdf &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 111 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Corporate Governance Succession Planning The Board of Directors regularly discusses management succession planning in meetings and executive sessions at both the Board and Committee level. As described in our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, reporting its findings and recommendations to the Board and works with the Board in evaluating potential successors to these executive management positions. The Compensation Committee regularly discusses and evaluates company-wide talent pools and succession plans, including short-term and long-term succession plans for development, retention and replacement of senior leaders. Directors regularly interact and engage with not only senior management talent and potential successors to executive management positions, but also high-potential leaders throughout the Company. This engagement occurs in Board meetings held throughout the year, as well as through informal events and updates, and regular one-on-one touchpoints. Code of Business Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines The Board sets high standards for Tesla&#8217;s workforce, officers and directors. Tesla is committed to establishing an operating framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the Company and managing its affairs in a manner consistent with rigorous principles of business ethics. Accordingly, Tesla has adopted a Code of Business Ethics, which was amended in December&#160;2021, and which is applicable to Tesla and its subsidiaries&#8217; directors, officers and personnel. Tesla has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and charters of the standing committees of the Board, form the framework for Tesla&#8217;s corporate governance. The Code of Business Ethics and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are each available on Tesla&#8217;s website at: http://ir.tesla.com/ &#8203; corporate. Tesla will disclose on its website any amendment to the Code of Business Ethics, as well as any waivers of the Code of Business Ethics, that are required to be disclosed by the rules of the SEC or Nasdaq. Director Independence The Board periodically assesses, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the independence of its members as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. The Board undertook an analysis for each director and director nominee and considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director&#8217;s other commercial, accounting, legal, banking, consulting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board determined that with respect to each of its current members and director nominees, other than Elon Musk, who is our Chief Executive Officer, and Kimbal Musk, who is Elon Musk&#8217;s brother, there are no disqualifying factors with respect to director independence enumerated in the listing standards of Nasdaq or any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and that each such member is an &#8220;independent director&#8221; as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws. In particular, the Board reviewed the following considerations: &#8226; Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk and JB Straubel and/or investment funds affiliated with them, have made minority investments in certain companies or investment funds, (i)&#160;of which other Tesla directors are founders, significant stockholders, directors, officers or managers, and/or (ii)&#160;with which Tesla has certain relationships set forth below in &#8220; Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Related Person Transactions .&#8221; The Board concluded that none of these investments are material so as to impede the exercise of independent judgment by any of Messrs. Ehrenpreis, Gebbia, Murdoch and Straubel. &#8203; &#160; 112 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Board Leadership Structure Roles of Chair of the Board Following careful deliberation, the Board appointed Robyn Denholm to serve as the independent Chair of the Board in November&#160;2018, having considered her strong leadership, independent presence and financial and business expertise on the Board over an extended period of time. Together, Ms.&#160;Denholm and our Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, comprise our senior Board leadership, which the Board believes is appropriate at this time to provide the most effective leadership structure for Tesla in a highly competitive and rapidly changing technology industry. As Chair of the Board, Ms.&#160;Denholm has broad authority and oversight over the affairs of the Board, with Mr.&#160;Musk available to her as a resource in this regard. Moreover, as an independent Chair of the Board, Ms.&#160;Denholm has the authority to direct the actions of the other independent directors and regularly communicate, as their representative, with Mr.&#160;Musk. As Chair of the Board, Ms.&#160;Denholm, among other things: &#8226; reviews the agenda and materials for meetings of the independent directors; &#8203; &#8226; consults with our Chief Executive Officer regarding Board meeting agendas, schedules and materials; &#8203; &#8226; acts as a liaison between our Chief Executive Officer and the independent directors when appropriate; &#8203; &#8226; otherwise communicates regularly with our Chief Executive Officer; &#8203; &#8226; raises issues with management on behalf of the independent directors; &#8203; &#8226; annually reviews, together with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board&#8217;s performance during the prior year; and &#8203; &#8226; serves as the Board&#8217;s liaison for consultation and communication with stockholders as appropriate. &#8203; Tesla also has a mechanism for stockholders to communicate directly with non-management directors (see &#8220; Corporate Governance&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Contacting the Board &#8221; below). Committees of the Board In addition, the Board has four standing committees&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which are each further described below. Each of the Board committees consists solely of independent directors, and the Board may appoint a chair to each committee. Our independent directors regularly meet in executive session and at such other times as necessary or appropriate as determined by the independent directors. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual Board members and identifies and evaluates candidates for election or re-election to the Board. See &#8220; Corporate Governance&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Process and Considerations for Nominating Board Candidates &#8221; below for additional information. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 113 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Board Role in Risk Oversight The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla while management is responsible for assessing and mitigating Tesla&#8217;s risks on a day-to-day basis. The Board is assisted by our Committees, which consists entirely of independent directors, and report to the Board as appropriate on matters that involve specific areas of risk that each Committee oversees. &#8203; &#8203; Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee oversees management of risks relating to Tesla&#8217;s compensation plans and programs. Tesla&#8217;s management and the Compensation Committee have assessed the risks associated with Tesla&#8217;s compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers. These include risks relating to setting ambitious targets for our employees&#8217; compensation or the vesting of their equity awards, our emphasis on at-risk equity-based compensation, discrepancies in the values of equity-based compensation depending on employee tenure relative to increases in stock price over time and the potential impact of such factors on the retention or decision-making of our employees, particularly our senior management. Based on the results of this assessment, Tesla does not believe that its compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Tesla. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Board Meetings and Committees During fiscal 2023, the Board held six meetings. We have a highly effective and engaged Board. While we do not maintain a numerical limit on public company boards our directors may serve on, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that each member is expected to ensure that other existing and future commitments, including employment responsibilities and service on the boards of other entities, do not materially interfere with the member&#8217;s service as director. When conducting its annual review of the effectiveness and productivity of its members, the Board evaluates many factors, including without limitation, the director&#8217;s attendance at meetings, the participation and input of the director and the director&#8217;s preparation at meetings. Each director attended or participated in 75% or more of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings of all Committees on which such director served (in each case held during such director&#8217;s relevant period of service). &#160; 114 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Audit Committee Members ROBYN DENHOLM JOE GEBBIA JAMES MURDOCH &#8203; &#8203; Primary Responsibilities Audit &#8226; Reviewing and approving the selection of Tesla&#8217;s independent auditors, and approving the audit and non-audit services to be performed by Tesla&#8217;s independent auditors &#8203; &#8226; Discussing the scope and results of the audit with the independent auditors and reviewing with management and the independent auditors Tesla&#8217;s interim and year-end operating results &#8203; Oversight and Compliance &#8226; Providing oversight, recommendations, and under specified thresholds, approvals, regarding significant financial matters and investment practices, including any material acquisitions and divestitures &#8203; &#8226; Monitoring the integrity of Tesla&#8217;s financial statements and Tesla&#8217;s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements as they relate to financial statements or accounting matters &#8203; &#8226; Reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of Tesla&#8217;s internal control policies and procedures in addition to Tesla&#8217;s risk management, data privacy and data security &#8203; Reporting &#8226; Reviewing and discussing the accounting assessment of our annual Impact Report and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures &#8203; &#8226; Preparing the audit committee report that the SEC requires in Tesla&#8217;s annual proxy statement &#8203; Financial Expertise and Independence Each member of the Audit Committee is &#8220;independent&#8221; as such term is defined for audit committee members by the listing standards of Nasdaq and applicable laws.

None of such persons is or was formerly an officer or an employee of Tesla. See &#8220; Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Related Person Transactions &#8221; below for certain transactions involving Tesla in which members of the Compensation Committee may potentially be deemed to have an indirect interest. During 2023, no interlocking relationships existed between any member of Tesla&#8217;s Board or Compensation Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company. Process and Considerations for Nominating Board Candidates The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, determining the criteria for Board membership, recommending Board candidates and proposing any changes to the composition of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee&#8217;s criteria and process for fulfilling these duties are generally as follows: &#8226; The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews the current composition and size of the Board, and oversees an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole and of its individual members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee applies uniform evaluation processes and standards for all Board members, including in identifying, considering or recommending new candidates for the Board to fill vacancies or add additional directors and in recommending existing Board members for nomination to be re-elected at annual meetings of stockholders. &#8203; &#8226; In carrying out the foregoing duties, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consistently seeks to achieve a complementary balance of knowledge, experience and capability &#8203; &#160; 118 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; on the Board. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for director candidates, it considers all pertinent factors that it considers appropriate, including diversity, and believes that the Board should consist of directors who (i)&#160;are, in the majority, independent, (ii)&#160;are of high integrity, (iii)&#160;have broad, business-related knowledge and experience at the policy-making level in business or technology, including their understanding of Tesla&#8217;s business in particular, (iv)&#160;have qualifications that will increase overall Board effectiveness, (v)&#160;represent diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and professional experience and (vi)&#160;meet other requirements as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or financial expertise with respect to Audit Committee members. For example, after conducting independent director searches from time to time in which numerous highly-qualified candidates from a variety of backgrounds were considered, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board Joe Gebbia as director in 2022 and JB Straubel as director nominee in 2023, to further bolster the Board&#8217;s expertise in technological innovation, public company management and sustainability initiatives. &#8226; In evaluating and identifying candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any third party search firm that is used to identify director candidates and has the authority to approve the fees and retention terms of any search firm. &#8203; &#8226; With regard to any candidates who are properly recommended by stockholders (as described in more detail below) or by other sources, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review the qualifications of any such candidate, which review may, in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee&#8217;s discretion, include interviewing references for the candidate, direct interviews with the candidate or other actions that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems necessary or proper. &#8203; &#8226; After completing its review and evaluation of director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends the director nominees that it has determined to be qualified to the full Board. &#8203; It is the policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider properly submitted recommendations for candidates to the Board from stockholders. Stockholder recommendations for candidates to the Board must be directed in writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, and should also be sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com. Such recommendations must include the candidate&#8217;s name, home and business contact information, detailed biographical data and qualifications, information regarding any relationships between the candidate and Tesla within the last three&#160;years and evidence of the nominating person&#8217;s ownership of Tesla stock. Such recommendations must also include a statement from the recommending stockholder in support of the candidate, particularly within the context of the criteria for Board membership, including issues of character, integrity, judgment, diversity, age, independence, skills, education, expertise, business acumen, business experience, length of service, understanding of Tesla&#8217;s business, other commitments and the like, as well as any personal references and an indication of the candidate&#8217;s willingness to serve. Board Diversity The Board believes that gender and minority representation is a key element in achieving the broad range of perspectives that the Board seeks among its members. As such, diversity is one of the important factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers when nominating Board candidates. Two of the five directors we added in the past four&#160;years are gender, racially and/or ethnically diverse and the chair of our Board is a woman. We believe that such representation promotes a culture of inclusion and diversity at Tesla. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts annual evaluations of our Board effectiveness, providing it with an opportunity to examine whether our Board members have the right composition of skills and experiences. The Board is committed to improving its current diversity, and the Committee continues to consider opportunities, including actively reaching out to diverse candidates, with the objective of increasing our Board diversity in a way that supports the current and anticipated needs of the Company, and of achieving at least 30% gender diversity on our Board. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 119 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; In addition, we mandate external search firms, when applicable, to prioritize searches for candidates with racial, ethnic and/or gender diversity.

All of our directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Stock Transactions Hedging, Short Sales and Rule&#160;10b5-1 Trading Plans Tesla has an insider trading policy that prohibits all of our directors, officers and employees from, among other things, engaging in short sales, hedging or similar transactions designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Tesla securities. This prohibition encompasses transactions in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to Tesla securities, but not transactions designed to facilitate portfolio diversification, such as broad-based index options, futures or baskets. Stock Ownership by Board and Management To align the interests at the highest level of our management with those of our stockholders, the Board has instituted the following requirements relating to stock ownership under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Each member of the Board and all of our named executive officers are subject to the following minimum stock ownership requirements: (i)&#160;each director is required to own shares of Tesla stock equal in value to at least five times the annual cash retainer for directors (regardless of whether or not the retainer has been waived, and exclusive of retainer amounts for service as a member or chair of a Board committee), and (ii)&#160;our named executive officers are required to own shares of Tesla stock equal in value to at least six times his/her base salary. Each individual shall have five&#160;years from the date such person assumed his or her relevant role at Tesla to come into compliance with these requirements. Each person&#8217;s compliance with the minimum stock ownership level will be determined on the date when this compliance grace period expires, and then annually on each December&#160;31, by multiplying the number of shares held by such person and the average closing price of those shares during the preceding month. Our named executive officers and each of our directors is currently either in compliance with these requirements or is in the applicable period to come into compliance therewith. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that no equity award as to which vesting or the lapse of a period of restriction occurs based solely on the passage of time that is granted to a &#160; 120 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; named executive officer may vest, or have a period of restriction that lapses, earlier than six&#160;months from the date on which such vesting or lapse commences. Furthermore, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that no named executive officer may sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of any shares of Tesla stock acquired pursuant to any stock option, restricted stock unit or other equity award granted by Tesla earlier than the date that is six&#160;months after the date on which such award vests or the period of restriction with respect to such award lapses, as applicable. Prohibition of Equity Award Repricing Tesla views equity-based compensation to be a key factor in incentivizing the future performance of our personnel. Consequently, the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220; 2019 Plan &#8221;) provides, and Tesla&#8217;s previous 2010 Equity Incentive Plan provided, that stock options and other equity awards issued under these plans that derive their value from the appreciation of the value of Tesla&#8217;s stock may not be exchanged for other awards, repurchased for cash or otherwise be made the subject of transactions that have the purpose or effect of repricing such awards. In addition, applicable Nasdaq rules prohibit any repricing with respect to the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January&#160;2018. Contacting the Board Any stockholder who desires to contact our non-employee directors regarding appropriate Tesla business-related comments may do so electronically at the following website: http://ir.tesla.com/ &#8203; corporate-governance/contact-the-board. Such stockholders who desire to contact our non-employee directors by mail may do so by writing to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this discussion. The following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2023 of (i)&#160;our principal executive officer, (ii)&#160;our principal financial officer, (iii)&#160;our former principal financial officer who served in such capacity until August&#160;2023 and (iv)&#160;the two most highly compensated persons, other than our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, who were serving as an executive officers at the end of our fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2023 (our &#8220;named executive officers&#8221;). We had no other executive officers serving at the end of our fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2023. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2023 were: &#8203; Name &#8203; &#8203; Position &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Elon Musk &#8203; &#8203; Technoking of Tesla and Chief Executive Officer &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Vaibhav Taneja &#8203; &#8203; Chief Financial Officer &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Tom Zhu &#8203; &#8203; Senior Vice President, Automotive &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Zachary Kirkhorn &#8203; &#8203; Former Master of Coin and Chief Financial Officer &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Andrew Baglino &#8203; &#8203; Former Senior Vice President, Powertrain and Energy Engineering &#8203; &#8203; Mr.&#160;Kirkhorn transitioned from his previous role as Master of Coin and Chief Financial Officer effective August&#160;2023. Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. Compensation Philosophy Our mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy. This is a long-term mission, and our compensation programs reflect this&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and our startup origins&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in that they consist primarily of salary or wages and equity awards. Whereas salary or wages are intended to meet our employees&#8217; near-term liquidity needs, we believe that equity awards are an effective tool for retaining employees long-term, as they vest incrementally over a period of time or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones intended to be achieved over the medium- and long-term. During periods in which our stock price and the underlying value of equity awards increase, their retention impact is even greater. We believe that the potential for such increases also creates an ownership culture that promotes holding equity, which in turn aligns the interests of our employees with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Additionally, this compensation philosophy further allows our employees to grow their skill sets and contributions consistent with our long-term mission. For these reasons, our goal is to provide each employee with the opportunity to participate in our equity programs, with certain cash-based bonus programs serving generally to accommodate specific incentive structures or liquidity needs. By combining salary or wages and our equity award program, we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets. In particular, we believe that compensation for the individuals who are responsible for Tesla&#8217;s strategic direction and operations should motivate them to achieve sustainable stockholder value and/or tangible milestones rather than to simply remain at Tesla or maintain the status quo. Therefore, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock&#160;units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, we are increasingly emphasizing for our executive officers the grant of stock option awards, which have zero initial value and accumulate &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 123 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. In addition, because equity awards comprise a greater proportion of our executive officers&#8217; total level of compensation compared to comparable roles at peer companies, a sustained decrease in our stock price or failure to achieve the applicable operational milestones may result in a level of total compensation that is significantly less than that of such peer roles. Likewise, our outside director compensation program has consisted primarily of equity awards that are entirely in the form of stock option awards, as well as relatively modest cash retainer payments that may be waived at the election of each director. We evaluate our compensation philosophy and programs regularly and evolve them as circumstances merit with oversight by the Compensation Committee, particularly with respect to executive and director compensation. For example, if our stock price experiences significant movement over a short period of time that results in a persistent change to equity compensation, certain adjustments may be considered to align our compensation programs to their intended purposes. &#160; 124 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation ROLE OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility of recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and reviewing and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as (i)&#160;an &#8220;independent director&#8221; under the Nasdaq rules and (ii)&#160;an &#8220;outside director&#8221; under Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code. See &#8220; Corporate Governance&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Board Meetings and Committees&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Compensation Committee &#8221; above. ROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage, and has from time to time engaged, the services of outside consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla&#8217;s compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. No compensation consultant was engaged to provide such services to us in 2023. ROLE OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN COMPENSATION DECISIONS Historically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers&#8217; responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program&#8217;s ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer&#8217;s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla&#8217;s performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive Officer&#8217;s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment, and approves the specific compensation for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, which is approved by the Board). All such compensation determinations by our Compensation Committee are largely discretionary. The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee&#8217;s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the 2019 Plan (the &#8220; Equity Award Committee &#8221;) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain limitations, such as, among other things, maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to employees at or above the level of vice president. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee. ROLE OF STOCKHOLDER SAY-ON-PAY VOTES At the 2011 annual meeting of our stockholders and at each annual meeting held every three&#160;years since, including most recently in 2023, we held triennial stockholder advisory &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221; votes on the compensation of our named executive officers for the immediately preceding fiscal&#160;years. At our 2023 annual meeting, our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 71% of our stockholders present and entitled to vote at the meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, the Compensation Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to evaluate our practices frequently. Moreover, we are &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 125 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; required to hold a vote at least every six&#160;years regarding how often to hold a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. We held our most recent such vote at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders indicated a preference for an annual vote. Consistent with the stockholder vote, we intend to hold a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next vote on the frequency of stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. See &#8220; Proposal Two&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Tesla Proposal for Non-Binding Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation. &#8221; We expect the next advisory &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221; vote will occur at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. CLAWBACK POLICY Our Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth a compensation recovery (&#8220; clawback &#8221;) policy with respect to our executive officers. Additionally, we adopted a clawback policy for compliance with the NASDAQ listing standards and Section&#160;10D of the Exchange Act, effective November&#160;15, 2023. This additional clawback policy applies to current and former executive officers as defined under the Exchange Act and only in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws; misconduct on the part of the executive is not required. Under this additional clawback policy, we are required to recoup incentive-based compensation (as that term is defined in Section&#160;10D of the Exchange Act) erroneously received within the three completed fiscal&#160;years immediately preceding the date on which we are required to prepare a restatement as defined under the clawback policy. Moreover, the terms of the 2018 CEO Performance Award include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the SEC. See &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Chief Executive Officer Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;2018 CEO Performance Award &#8221; below. Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation OVERVIEW AND FISCAL YEAR 2023 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS Our current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee, generally consists of base salary and equity-based incentives, as well as other benefits generally available to employees. We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages with the goal of providing, on a total basis, competitive pay and align the interests of our named executive officers with long-term stockholder interests by tying the value of their compensation to our long-term stock price and/or the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives. In 2023, Tesla&#8217;s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following: &#8226; Total revenues of $96.77&#160;billion, representing an increase of $15.31&#160;billion, compared to the prior year; &#8203; &#8226; Annual vehicle delivery and production records of 1,808,581 and 1,845,985 total vehicles, representing an increase of 37.7% and 34.8%, respectively, compared to the prior year; &#8203; &#8226; 14.72 gigawatt hours of energy storage, representing an increase of 126.5%, compared to the prior year; and &#8203; &#8226; Ongoing progress in the global growth of our manufacturing capabilities, including production and ramp at Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and our Megafactory in Lathrop, CA, and announcement of a new Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico and Megafactory in Shanghai, China. &#8203; BASE SALARY The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer&#8217;s and other executive officers&#8217; base salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we &#160; 126 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; currently do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-based element of our executive officers&#8217; compensation structure. The following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2023 for our named executive officers: Name &#8203; &#8203; 2023 Fiscal Year-End Base Salary($) (1) &#8203; Elon Musk &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8212; (2) &#8203; &#8203; Vaibhav Taneja &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 275,000 &#8203; &#8203; Tom Zhu &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 381,009 &#8203; &#8203; Zachary Kirkhorn &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8212; (3) &#8203; &#8203; Andrew Baglino &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 300,000 (4) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; (1) Reflects an annualized rate assuming 52 weeks each consisting of five work days. &#8203; (2) Mr.&#160;Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May&#160;2019 at Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. &#8203; (3) Mr.&#160;Kirkhorn transitioned from his previous role as Master of Coin and Chief Financial Officer effective August&#160;2023. &#8203; (4) Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. &#8203; EQUITY-BASED INCENTIVES Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. The equity awards we have historically granted and currently grant are options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. We have granted to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We are increasingly emphasizing the grant of stock option awards for our named executive officers, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant. Accordingly, all equity awards granted to our named executive officers in 2020 (the last year awards were granted to any of our named executive officers except for Tom&#160;Zhu, our Senior Vice President, Automotive, who received stock option awards upon his promotion to such role) were in the form of stock option awards. As a result, a significant portion of our named executive officers&#8217; total compensation is entirely at risk, depending on long-term stock price performance. While we strive to offer a total level of compensation that is competitive within specific roles and geographical markets, we do not have a rigid set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive market factors, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer, the impact of any dramatic changes in our stock price over a short period of time and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer, to determine the level and types of equity awards that it approves. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees, including executives, upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to a new position. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we periodically grant additional equity awards to our executives. See &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2023 &#8221; below. The Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 127 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS No named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla. BONUS We do not currently have or have planned, and historically we have rarely entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards. NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN COMPENSATION We did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2023, and we do not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan compensation. PERQUISITES Generally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers which are not offered on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees as well. HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS We provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees: &#8226; medical insurance including comprehensive transgender and fertility coverage, mental health, dental and vision; &#8203; &#8226; adoption and surrogacy benefits; &#8203; &#8226; confidential Employee Assistance Program counseling; &#8203; &#8226; life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance; &#8203; &#8226; a Section&#160;401(k) plan where Tesla provides a company match equal to 50% of the employee&#8217;s contribution, up to a maximum of 3% of the employee&#8217;s eligible compensation with a $3,000 annual cap; &#8203; &#8226; an employee stock purchase plan; &#8203; &#8226; short-and long-term disability insurance; &#8203; &#8226; medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and &#8203; &#8226; a health savings account. &#8203; Chief Executive Officer Compensation OVERVIEW Historically, in developing compensation recommendations for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to appropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer&#8217;s previous and current contributions and to create incentives for our Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the 2012 CEO Performance Award was focused on this latter objective, as it solely rewards future performance. In addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer since October&#160;2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and actively to Tesla since our earliest days in April&#160;2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and design, raising capital for us, bringing investors to us and raising our public awareness. CASH COMPENSATION Mr.&#160;Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May&#160;2019 at Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary. &#160; 128 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; HISTORICAL EQUITY COMPENSATION Prior to stock option awards made in December&#160;2009, Mr.&#160;Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services for a period of five&#160;years. In 2010 and 2011, Mr.&#160;Musk did not receive any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his grants made in December&#160;2009 already provided sufficient motivation for Mr.&#160;Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer. In August&#160;2012, to create incentives for continued long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as well as from Tesla&#8217;s then-planned Model X and Model 3 programs, and to further align executive compensation with increases in stockholder value, the Board granted to Mr.&#160;Musk the 2012 CEO Performance Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase 79,123,515 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla&#8217;s common stock, representing 5% of Tesla&#8217;s total issued and outstanding shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consisted of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a combination of (i)&#160;the achievement of a specified operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model&#160;3, aggregate vehicle production or a gross margin target, and (ii)&#160;a sustained incremental $4&#160;billion increase in Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization from $3.2&#160;billion, Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization at the time of grant. Prior to its expiration in 2022, the market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches and nine of the 10 operational milestones had been achieved, and nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance Award vested. Prior to 2018, the only additional equity awards received by Mr.&#160;Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during 2013 pursuant to a patent incentive program that was available to our employees generally. 2018 CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD Early in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its market capitalization to over $55&#160;billion in just over five&#160;years, the independent members of the Board began preliminary discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize Mr.&#160;Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development. In January&#160;2018, following more than six&#160;months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional stockholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr.&#160;Musk. Such grant was subject to approval by a majority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr.&#160;Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting of the stockholders to approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On March&#160;21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately 73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. The 2018 CEO Performance Award was comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 303,960,630 shares (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split) of Tesla&#8217;s common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that were each equivalent to 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $23.34 per share (as adjusted for the 2020 Stock Split and 2022 Stock Split). Each of the 12 tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board that both (i)&#160;the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at $100&#160;billion for the first &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 129 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; tranche and increased by increments of $50&#160;billion thereafter and (ii)&#160;any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on profitability, was met: &#8203; Total Revenue * (in billions) &#8203; &#8203; Adjusted EBITDA ** (in billions) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $20.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 1.5 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $35.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 3.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $55.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 4.5 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $75.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 6.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $100.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 8.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $125.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 10.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $150.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 12.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $175.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 14.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; * &#8220;Revenue&#8221; means total revenues as reported in Tesla&#8217;s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. &#8203; ** &#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221; means (i)&#160;net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)&#160;interest expense, (iii)&#160;(benefit) provision for income taxes, (iv)&#160;depreciation and amortization and (v)&#160;stock-based compensation, as each such item is reported in Tesla&#8217;s financial statements on Forms&#160;10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. &#8203; Any single operational milestone could only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone was achieved, it was forever deemed achieved for purposes of determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones does not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr.&#160;Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization milestones was based on both (i)&#160;a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla&#8217;s stock price as well as (ii)&#160;a 30 calendar day trailing average of Tesla&#8217;s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone would have been adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they had been considered material to the achievement of those milestones. In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla&#8217;s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla&#8217;s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization and operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla was required to add approximately $600&#160;billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award on a sustained basis, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163&#160;billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8&#160;billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. In addition, Mr.&#160;Musk was required to continue leading Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone was met in order for the corresponding &#160; 130 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr.&#160;Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five&#160;years post-exercise. There would have been no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s termination, death or disability or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones would have been based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla&#8217;s stockholders in the change in control. In the event of a restatement of Tesla&#8217;s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr.&#160;Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award is subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr.&#160;Musk except as required by applicable law. As of the date of this filing, all of the milestones have been achieved and certified by our Board. Consequently, all 12 of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 303,960,630 shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s payment of the exercise price of $23.34 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise. Realized Compensation For purposes of the table in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Summary Compensation Table &#8221; below, we are required to report pursuant to applicable SEC rules any stock option grants to Mr.&#160;Musk at values determined as of their respective grant dates and which are driven by certain assumptions prescribed by ASC Topic 718 . Moreover, we are required to report in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Pay Ratio Disclosure &#8221; below (i)&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s annual total compensation, (ii)&#160;the median of the annual total compensation of all Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis, other than Mr.&#160;Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the methodology used for the table in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Summary Compensation Table, &#8221; and (iii)&#160;the ratio of the former to the latter. In addition, we are required to report in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;2023 Option Exercises and Stock Vested &#8221; below an amount for the &#8220;value realized&#8221; upon: (i)&#160;any exercise by Mr.&#160;Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option and (ii)&#160;any vesting of a restricted stock unit award, based on the market price of the award at the time of vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr.&#160;Musk does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting. As a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr.&#160;Musk in a given year in such sections and the value actually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr.&#160;Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for future performance with their value realizable only if Tesla&#8217;s stock price appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved applicable vesting requirements. To supplement the disclosures in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Summary Compensation Table, &#8221; &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Pay Ratio Disclosure &#8221; and &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;2023 Option Exercises and Stock Vested &#8221; below, we have included the following table, which shows the total realized compensation of Mr.&#160;Musk for the last three fiscal&#160;years, as well as the ratio of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s realized compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all other Tesla employees &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 131 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; qualifying for this analysis as reported in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Pay Ratio Disclosure. &#8221; Realized compensation is not a substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure, but we believe that realized compensation is an important factor in understanding that the value of compensation that Mr.&#160;Musk ultimately realizes is dependent on a number of additional factors, including: (i)&#160;the vesting of certain of his option awards only upon the successful achievement of a number of market capitalization increases and operational milestone targets; (ii)&#160;the fact that Mr.&#160;Musk does not receive any cash if he does not actually sell shares and thereby reduce his investment in us, and he does not receive any cash to the extent that he sells only shares sufficient to cover income taxes with respect to his awards (including stock options exercised solely to avoid their expiration in accordance with their terms); and (iii)&#160;the then-current market value of our common stock at the times at which Mr.&#160;Musk may elect to actually sell his shares.

Mr.&#160;Musk paid the exercise price and applicable taxes in cash, and did not sell any of the resulting shares. &#8203; (3) Reflects the exercise of vested stock options scheduled to expire in 2022 as to which Mr.&#160;Musk paid the exercise price in cash. Of the shares received upon exercise, 42.0% were immediately sold in order to pay federal and state tax withholding from the option exercise and none of the proceeds from such sales were retained by Mr.&#160;Musk. Of the remaining shares, 94.6% were retained by Mr.&#160;Musk. The other 5.4% automatically were sold as a result of a Rule&#160;10b5-1 trading plan put in place in September&#160;2021. &#8203; Tax and Accounting Considerations Sections&#160;280G and 409A . We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section&#160;280G or Section&#160;409A of the Tax Code. Section&#160;280G and related Tax Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant stockholder interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the amounts subject to the additional tax. Section&#160;409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or service provider of certain types receives &#8220;deferred compensation&#8221; that does not meet the requirements of Section&#160;409A. Tax Deduction Limit .&#160;&#160;&#160;Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to certain &#160; 132 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; executive officers. However, prior to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation in December&#160;2017 (the &#8220; Tax Act &#8221;), certain types of performance-based compensation were excluded from the $1,000,000 deduction limit if specific requirements were met. Under the Tax Act, this exclusion for performance-based compensation is not available with respect to taxable&#160;years beginning after December&#160;31, 2017, unless the compensation is pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on or before November&#160;2, 2017, and which is not modified in any material respect on or after such date. Pursuant to the Tax Act, for taxable&#160;years beginning after December&#160;31, 2017, Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code was expanded to cover additional executive officers and other employees, including the chief financial officer, so that the compensation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (at any time during the fiscal year), the three next most highly compensated executive officers during the taxable year and any other individual who was considered a &#8220;covered employee&#8221; for any prior taxable year that begins after 2016, will be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limit under Section&#160;162(m) of the Tax Code. Commencing with our 2018 fiscal year, to the extent that the aggregate amount of any covered officer&#8217;s salary, bonus, any amount realized from certain option exercises and vesting of restricted stock&#160;units or other equity awards, and certain other compensation amounts that are recognized as taxable income by the officer exceeds $1,000,000, we will not be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax deduction for the amount over $1,000,000 in that year, unless the compensation qualifies for the transition relief applicable to certain written binding contracts in effect on or before November&#160;2, 2017. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers and reserves the right to pay compensation that may not be deductible to Tesla if it determines that doing so would be in the best interests of Tesla. Accounting Implications . We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date &#8220;fair value&#8221; of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our named executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award. Other Information On June 4, 2018, a Tesla stockholder filed a stockholder derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and certain current and former Tesla directors in connection with the Tesla Board&#8217;s approval of the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On January 30, 2024, the Court entered judgment for the plaintiff stockholder, and granted the plaintiff&#8217;s request that the 2018 CEO Performance Award be fully rescinded. Tesla plans to appeal the Court&#8217;s decision. In addition, following the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board (with Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves) has determined to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, determined that the ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and recommends that our stockholders approve the ratification of the 2018 Performance Award at the 2024 Annual Meeting.

The assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&#160;31, 2023, filed with the SEC on January&#160;29, 2024. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock appreciating from that on the grant date(s) of the option(s). &#8203; (2) Reflects matching contributions made under the Tesla 401(k) Plan based on each of the named executive officer&#8217;s contributions for the applicable year. &#8203; (3) While Mr.&#160;Zhu was on assignment from Gigafactory Shanghai, he received certain benefits offered to all Tesla employees on assignment. All Other Compensation consists of $366,896 for tax gross-up reimbursement payments, $27,829 for housing allowance, $34,546 for cost of living adjustments, $102,694 for tax assistance reimbursement payments for 2022 taxes, $134 for relocation fees, $3,000 to reflect matching contributions made under the Tesla 401(k) Plan based on Mr. Zhu&#8217;s fiscal 2023 contributions and a $10,769 Qualified Non Elective Contribution made by Tesla. &#8203; (4) Mr.&#160;Kirkhorn transitioned from his previous role as Master of Coin and Chief Financial Officer effective August&#160;2023. &#8203; (5) Mr. Baglino departed Tesla in April 2024. &#8203; Pay Ratio Disclosure Tesla is committed to fair and competitive compensation for our employees. Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is substantially tied to the appreciation of our market capitalization. Because equity awards are generally made available to Tesla employees, this also means that Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation is tied to the success of Tesla employees. We are providing a ratio of (i)&#160;Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s 2023 annual total compensation to (ii)&#160;the median of the 2023 annual total compensation of all applicable qualifying Tesla employees other than Mr.&#160;Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the disclosure requirements of &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Summary Compensation Table &#8221; above. As we continue our expansion, the median annual total compensation of our employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices. Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s 2023 annual total compensation, as reported in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Summary Compensation Table, &#8221; was $0, and the median 2023 annual total compensation of all other qualifying &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 135 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was $45,811. Consequently, the applicable ratio of such amounts for 2023 was 0.00:1. Our methodology for identifying the median of the 2023 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr.&#160;Musk was as follows: &#8226; We selected December&#160;31, 2023, which is within the last three&#160;months of 2023, as the date upon which we would identify the &#8220;median employee&#8221; because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. &#8203; &#8226; We determined that as of December&#160;31, 2023, Tesla and all our subsidiaries had 140,666 individuals qualifying for this analysis (full-time, part-time and temporary employees other than Mr.&#160;Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which approximately 44% were based outside of the U.S. and approximately 37% were production line employees. &#8203; &#8226; We did not include in the population of qualifying individuals any employees of staffing agencies whose compensation is determined by such agencies. &#8203; &#8226; We applied the requirements and assumptions required for the table in &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Summary Compensation Table &#8221; for each of such individuals to calculate the total annual compensation, including base salary or wages, performance-based commission payments, and equity awards based on their grant date fair values. &#8203; &#8226; We converted any payment earned or paid in a foreign currency to U.S. dollar using the average of the prevailing conversion rates for the month of December&#160;2023. &#8203; &#8226; We selected the median of all total annual compensation amounts calculated in accordance with the foregoing. &#8203; Pay Versus Performance In accordance with Section&#160;953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item&#160;402(v) of Regulation&#160;S-K, we are required to disclose certain information about the relationship between the compensation actually paid to our named executive officers and certain measures of company performance.

See &#8220; Executive Compensation&#8201;&#8212; Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; Chief Executive Officer Compensation &#8221; for more information. The vesting of Mr. Musk&#8217;s awards were tied to specific market capitalization and operational milestones focusing on total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. However, the compensation actually paid as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K is based on the accounting changes in the fair value of such options, which varies significantly with the performance of our common stock. Thus, because the Company TSR is calculated from the beginning of the earliest year presented, a positive TSR does not necessarily correlate to an increase in compensation actually paid if the increase in TSR is less significant relative to a prior year. In addition, due to the fact that Mr. Musk did not receive any additional equity grants following the 2018 CEO Performance Award, his amount of total compensation actually paid decreased because the number of unvested options decreased year over year upon the vesting of tranches of the award. Because the 2018 CEO Performance Award has fully vested, Mr. Musk&#8217;s compensation actually paid will converge to $0 unless he receives a new grant. While a positive TSR may not align with an increase in compensation actually paid, as further demonstrated by the following graph, any decreases in TSR would align to decreases in compensation actually paid. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 139 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Other NEOs From 2022 to 2023, compensation actually paid to the other NEOs increased by 127.7%. Over this same period, TSR increased by 101.7%, net income increased by 19.0%, and revenue increased by 18.8%. From 2021 to 2022, compensation actually paid to the other NEOs decreased by 122.5%. Over this same period, TSR decreased by 65.0%, net income increased by 123.0%, and revenue increased by 51.4%. From 2020 to 2021, compensation actually paid to the other NEOs decreased by 118.9%. Over this same period, TSR increased by 49.8%, net income increased by 554.8%, and revenue increased by 70.7%. Though our other NEOs do receive a base salary, a significant portion of their compensation actually paid consists of equity awards. As the compensation actually paid as calculated pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, is based on the accounting changes in the fair value of such options through their vest dates, the value varies significantly with the performance of our common stock. Thus, because the Company TSR is calculated from the beginning of the earliest year presented, a positive overall TSR does not necessarily correlate to an increase in compensation actually paid if the stock price decreased in a given year. In addition, other than Mr. Zhu, our Senior Vice President, Automotive, who received stock option awards in 2023 upon his promotion to such role, none of our other NEOs received any additional equity grants after 2020. As such their compensation actually paid will be smaller as the number of unvested options they hold decreases. From 2020 to 2021, some of the decrease in compensation actually paid to our other NEOs was a result of Jerome Guillen&#8217;s departure in June 2021, which led to certain forfeitures of unvested awards. From 2022 to 2023, compensation actually paid to our other NEOs was impacted by Zachary Kirkhorn&#8217;s departure in December 2023, which led to certain forfeitures of unvested awards. While a positive TSR may not align with an increase in compensation actually paid, as further demonstrated by the following graph, any decreases in TSR would align with decreases in compensation actually paid. &#160;

In June&#160;2021, the Board unanimously adopted a resolution to forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously approved by the Board (the &#8220;Board Stock Option Grants &#8221;) until July&#160;2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. In May&#160;2022, the Board agreed to further forego the Board Stock Option Grants until the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. &#8203; (4) Board term ended in May&#160;2023 without standing for re-election at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. &#8203; Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements Overview and Philosophy The compensation program for Tesla&#8217;s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted stock&#160;units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are sold. The remaining portion of our directors&#8217; compensation has consisted of cash retainer payments that are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each director. Consequently, a large portion and in some cases, the entirety, of each of our non-employee directors&#8217; compensation is entirely at risk, and fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options then held by each of our non-employee directors being out-of-the-money. In 2020 and 2021, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Director Compensation Policy with the aid of Compensia and in light of Tesla&#8217;s exceptional performance and commitment to at-risk director compensation in the form of annual stock option awards to ensure continued alignment of the interests of directors with those of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders. Following such review, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board approve a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic grants of annual stock option awards under the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise previously approved by the Board until July&#160;2022 unless the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. In June&#160;2021, the Board unanimously approved and adopted this resolution and in May&#160;2022, the Board agreed to further forego the Board Stock Option Grants until the Board earlier acts to amend the Director Compensation Policy or otherwise amends such resolution. The Compensation Committee intends to make further recommendations with respect to the Board&#8217;s compensation program for directors, if any, who join the Board after the date of this resolution, as well as for future periods of service by existing directors, following further periodic reviews. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 145 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Other Information If, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to the director shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable. Non-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board committee meetings reimbursed by Tesla. On June 17, 2020, a stockholder filed a Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and certain current and former Tesla Directors in connection with the Tesla Board&#8217;s approval of director compensation awards from 2017 through 2020. On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement with the Court, which would finally resolve the matter if approved. On October 13, 2023, a settlement approval hearing was held in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The approval of the settlement was taken under advisement by the Court and a decision is pending. Pledging of Shares The ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently related to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. In order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our directors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock&#160;units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed, (i)&#160;with respect to our CEO, the lesser of $3.5&#160;billion or twenty-five&#160;percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock, or (ii)&#160;with respect to our directors and officers other than our CEO, fifteen percent&#160;(15%) of the total value of the pledged stock. Example: A director (other than our CEO) pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 15% of 1,000 x $800, or $120,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $120,000 against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $240,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the director must repay $60,000 to maintain compliance with the 15% limit under the pledging policy. See &#8220; Ownership of Securities &#8221; below for information regarding any shares pledged by our directors or executive officers as of March&#160;31, 2024; however, such pledging does not indicate the extent to which there may be actual borrowings against such shares as of such date, which may be substantially less than the value of the shares pledged. As of December&#160;31, 2023, based on written representations of our directors and executive officers to the Company, the aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by our directors and executive officers&#8217; pledged shares was less than 1% of the total value of the pledged shares. We require our directors and executive officers to make written representations, at least annually, that he or she is in compliance with our pledging policy. If a director or executive officer wishes to take a loan collateralized by pledged stock, Tesla management works with the director or executive officer during the original loan approval, and subsequently monitors compliance with this policy by regularly reviewing and requesting updates from the applicable director or executive officer on his or her pledged stock amount and loan amount. If necessary, Tesla management will report to the Board or its committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock. We believe that this monitoring is effective and includes appropriate controls, and we have confirmed that each of our directors and executive officers who have pledged stock are and have been compliant with this policy since our last&#160;confirmation. &#160; 146 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Equity Compensation Plan&#160;Information The following table summarizes the number of securities underlying outstanding options, stock awards, warrants and rights granted to employees and directors, as well as the number of securities remaining available for future issuance, under Tesla&#8217;s equity compensation awards as of December&#160;31, 2023. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; (a) &#8203; &#8203; (b) &#8203; &#8203; (c) &#8203; Plan category &#8203; &#8203; Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights (#) (1) &#8203; &#8203; Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights ($) (2) &#8203; &#8203; Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a)) (#) &#8203; Equity compensation plans approved by security holders &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 363,015,615 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 35.11 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 228,813,959 (3) &#8203; &#8203; Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 92,999 (4) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 37.03 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8212; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 363,108,614 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 35.11 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 228,813,959 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; (1) Consists of options to purchase shares of our common stock, including the 2018 CEO Performance Award, and restricted stock unit awards representing the right to acquire shares of our common stock. &#8203; (2) The weighted average exercise price is calculated based solely on the outstanding stock options.

In assessing a related person transaction brought before it for approval the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person&#8217;s interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee may then approve or disapprove the transaction in its discretion, or may request additional information. Related person transactions will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC. Related Person Transactions Elon Musk is an executive officer, director and/or significant stockholder of SpaceX, X and TBC. SpaceX is party to certain commercial, licensing and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, SpaceX incurred expenses of approximately $2.1&#160;million in 2023 and approximately $0.8&#160;million through February&#160;2024. Since April&#160;2016, SpaceX has invoiced Tesla for our use of an aircraft owned and operated by SpaceX at rates determined by Tesla and SpaceX, subject to rules of the Federal Aviation Administration governing such arrangements. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.7&#160;million in 2023 and approximately $0.1&#160;million through February&#160;2024. X is party to certain commercial, consulting and support agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, X incurred expenses of approximately $1&#160;million in 2023 and approximately $0.02&#160;million through February&#160;2024, and Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.05&#160;million in 2023 and approximately $0.03&#160;million through February&#160;2024. As part of a multi-platform advertising campaign, Tesla also directly or indirectly purchased advertising on X, which totaled approximately $0.2&#160;million through February&#160;2024. TBC is party to commercial agreements with Tesla. Under these agreements, Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $0.2&#160;million in 2023 and approximately $1&#160;million through February&#160;2024. In December&#160;2023, we entered into a service agreement with a security company, owned by Elon Musk and organized to provide security services concerning him, including in connection with his duties to and work for Tesla. Tesla incurred expenses of approximately $2.4&#160;million for such security services in 2023 and approximately $0.5&#160;million through February&#160;2024, representing a portion of the total cost of security services concerning Elon Musk. JB Straubel is the Chief Executive Officer of Redwood. Tesla is party to an agreement with Redwood to supply certain scrap materials. Under this agreement, Redwood incurred expenses of approximately $11.5&#160;million in 2023 and approximately $6&#160;million through February&#160;2024. Other Transactions Tesla periodically does business with certain entities its directors are affiliated with. Such transactions are done on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances. &#160; 148 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters with our executive officers. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In relation to our CEO&#8217;s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November&#160;2021 to indemnify the Company for additional taxes owed, if any. &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 149 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Delinquent Section&#160;16(a) Reports Under Section&#160;16 of the Exchange Act, Tesla&#8217;s directors, executive officers and any persons holding more than 10% of the Tesla&#8217;s common stock are required to report initial ownership of the Tesla common stock and any subsequent changes in ownership to the SEC. Specific due dates have been established by the SEC, and Tesla is required to disclose in this proxy statement any failure to file required ownership reports by these dates. Based solely upon a review of forms filed with the SEC and the written representations of such persons for their 2023 fiscal year transactions, Tesla is aware of no late Section&#160;16(a) filings. &#160; 150 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Ownership of Securities The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of Tesla&#8217;s common stock, as of March 31, 2024, for the following: &#8226; each person (or group of affiliated persons) who is known by us to beneficially own 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock; &#8203; &#8226; each of our non-employee directors; &#8203; &#8226; each of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement; and &#8203; &#8226; all current directors and executive officers of Tesla as a group. &#8203; In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the&#160;percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or other convertible securities held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60&#160;days of March&#160;31, 2024. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the&#160;percentage ownership of any other person.

The Board has determined that Ms.&#160;Denholm is an &#8220;audit committee financial expert&#8221; as defined in the rules of the SEC. Oversight The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by: &#8226; Providing oversight, recommendations, and under specified thresholds, approvals, regarding significant financial matters and investment practices, including any material acquisitions and divestitures; &#8203; &#8226; Monitoring the integrity of Tesla&#8217;s financial statements and Tesla&#8217;s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements as they relate to financial statements or accounting matters; and &#8203; &#8226; Reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of Tesla&#8217;s internal control policies and procedures in addition to Tesla&#8217;s risk management, data privacy and data security. &#8203; In addition to overseeing key risks in the areas of data security and privacy, crisis risk management, ethics and compliance, and ESG, as discussed below, the Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing risks in other areas of our business and operation.

The Audit Committee receives regular updates from senior management, including our Chief Information Officer, on data security risk reviews of Tesla&#8217;s key business segments and products, procedures to assess and address data security risk, and the effectiveness of data security technologies and solutions deployed internally.

During the course of the fiscal year, the Audit Committee is given regular updates regarding audit related and non-audit related fees.

You may cast one vote for each share of common stock held by you as of the Record Date on all matters presented. See the questions entitled &#8220; How can I vote my shares in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8221;, &#8220; How can I vote my shares virtually at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8221; and &#8220; How can I vote my shares without attending the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8221; below for additional details. As of the Record Date, we had 3,189,110,359 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record or as a beneficial owner? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; You are the &#8220;stockholder of record&#8221; of any shares that are registered directly in your name with Tesla&#8217;s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. A minority of our stockholders are stockholders of record . We have sent the Notice of Internet Availability directly to you if you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may grant your voting proxy directly to Tesla or to a third party or vote in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting as described more fully below. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; You are the &#8220;beneficial owner&#8221; of any shares (which are considered to be held in &#8220;street name&#8221;) that are held on your behalf by a brokerage account or by a bank or another intermediary that is the stockholder of record for those shares. The vast majority of our stockholders are beneficial owners . If you are a beneficial owner, you did not receive a Notice of Internet Availability directly from Tesla, but your broker, bank or other intermediary forwarded you a notice together with voting instructions for directing that organization how to vote your shares. You may also attend the 2024 Annual Meeting in person (if you are eligible per our random drawing to attend in person), but because a beneficial owner is not a stockholder of record, you may not vote in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting unless you obtain a &#8220;legal proxy&#8221; from the organization that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; How can I vote my shares in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; You may vote shares for which you are the stockholder of record in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting. You may vote shares for which you are the beneficial owner in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting only if you obtain a &#8220;legal proxy&#8221; from the broker, bank or other intermediary that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the 2024 Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also direct the voting of your shares as described below in the question entitled &#8220;How can I vote my shares without attending the 2024 Annual Meeting?&#8221; so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to attend the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; How can I vote my shares virtually at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; In order to join, submit questions and vote virtually via the Internet at the 2024 Annual Meeting, you will need a 16-digit secure &#8220;control number&#8221; unique to you, which you may obtain as follows. &#8226; If you are a &#8220;stockholder of record&#8221; with shares registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (a minority of Tesla stockholders), you can find the control number on the Notice of Internet Availability or paper proxy card that was sent to you. &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 158 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8226; If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name: &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#187; The voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee should indicate whether the institution has a process for beneficial holders to provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm gives you this opportunity, the voting instructions from the bank or brokerage firm that accompany these proxy materials will tell you how to use the Internet or telephone to direct the vote of shares held in your account. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#187; If your voting instruction form does not include Internet or telephone information, please complete, and return the voting instruction form in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided by your broker. Stockholders who vote by proxy or by telephone need not return a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Even if you plan to attend the 2024 Annual Meeting virtually via the Internet, we recommend that you also direct the voting of your shares as described below in the question entitled &#8220;How can I vote my shares without attending the 2024 Annual Meeting?&#8221; so that your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to attend the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; How can I vote my shares without attending the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; Whether you hold shares as a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the 2024 Annual Meeting by the following means: By Internet &#8212; Stockholders of record with Internet access may submit proxies by following the voting instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability until 10:59&#160;a.m., Central Time on June&#160;12, 2024. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, please check the voting instructions in the notice provided by your broker, bank or other intermediary for Internet voting availability. By telephone &#8212; Stockholders of record who live in the United States (or its territories) or Canada may request a paper proxy card from Tesla by following the procedures in the Notice of Internet Availability, and submit proxies by following the applicable &#8220;Vote by Phone&#8221; instructions on the proxy card. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, please check the voting instructions in the notice provided by your broker, bank or other intermediary for telephone voting availability. By mail &#8212; Stockholders of record may request a paper proxy card from Tesla by following the procedures in the Notice of Internet Availability. If you elect to vote by mail, please complete, sign and date the proxy card where indicated and return it in the prepaid envelope included with the proxy card. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the time of the meeting in order for your shares to be voted. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may vote by mail by completing, signing and dating the voting instructions in the notice provided by your broker, bank or other intermediary and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; The stockholders of record of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting must either (i)&#160;be present in person or virtually via the Internet at the 2024 Annual Meeting or (ii)&#160;have properly submitted a proxy in order to constitute a quorum at the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 159 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, abstentions and broker &#8220;non-votes&#8221; are counted as present, and therefore are included for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the 2024 Annual Meeting. A broker &#8220;non-vote&#8221; occurs when an organization that is the stockholder of record that holds shares for a beneficial owner, and which is otherwise counted as present or represented by proxy, does not vote on a particular proposal because that organization does not have discretionary voting power under applicable regulations to vote on that item and has not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; What proposals will be voted on at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; The proposals scheduled to be voted on at the 2024 Annual Meeting are: TESLA PROPOSALS &#187; A Tesla proposal to elect two Class&#160;II directors listed in this proxy statement to serve for a term of three&#160;years, or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified (&#8220;Proposal One&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A Tesla proposal to approve executive compensation on a non-binding advisory basis (&#8220;Proposal Two&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A Tesla proposal to approve the redomestication of Tesla from Delaware to Texas by conversion (&#8220;Proposal Three&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A Tesla proposal to ratify the 100% performance-based stock option award to Elon Musk that was proposed to and approved by our stockholders in 2018 (&#8220;Proposal Four&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A Tesla proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&#160;31, 2024 (&#8220;Proposal Five&#8221;); &#8203; STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding reduction of director terms to one year, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Six&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding simple majority voting provisions in our governing documents, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Seven&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding annual reporting on anti-harassment and discrimination efforts, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Eight&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding adoption of a freedom of association and collective bargaining policy, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Nine&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding reporting on effects and risks associated with electromagnetic radiation and wireless technologies, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Ten&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding adopting targets and reporting on metrics to assess the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics into senior executive compensation plans, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Eleven&#8221;); and &#8203; &#187; A stockholder proposal regarding committing to a moratorium on sourcing minerals from deep sea mining, if properly presented (&#8220;Proposal Twelve&#8221;). &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 160 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?

&#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; All shares entitled to vote and that are voted in person at the 2024 Annual Meeting will be counted, and all shares represented by properly executed and unrevoked proxies received prior to the 2024 Annual Meeting will be voted at the 2024 Annual Meeting as indicated in such proxies. You may vote &#8220; FOR ,&#8221; &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; or &#8220; ABSTAIN &#8221; on each of the nominees for election as director (Proposal One), and on each of Proposals Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; With respect to the election of directors, Tesla&#8217;s bylaws provide that in an uncontested election, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to elect a director. Abstentions with respect to any director nominee (Proposal One) or any of Proposals Two, Three, Four (under the Bylaws Standard), Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve will have the same effect as a vote against such nominee or Proposal. Consequently, each director nominee will be elected, and each of Proposals Two, Three, Four (under the Bylaws Standard), Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve will be approved or ratified, as applicable, only if the number of shares voted &#8220; FOR &#8221; such nominee or Proposal exceeds the total number of shares voted &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; or to &#8220; ABSTAIN &#8221; with respect to such nominee or Proposal. For Proposal Four, under the NASDAQ Standard or the Ratification Disinterested Standard, abstentions shall have no effect on the Ratification. &#8203; &#160; 162 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Q &#8203; &#8203; What is the effect of not casting a vote or if I submit a proxy but do not specify how my shares are to be voted? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; If you are a stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone or via the Internet before the 2024 Annual Meeting, or in person or virtually via the Internet at the 2024 Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the 2024 Annual Meeting. If you submit a proxy, but you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board (or, if there is no recommendation of the Board on a Proposal, your shares will not be voted on such Proposal). &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the organization that is the stockholder of record for your shares with voting instructions, the organization will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under applicable regulations, brokers and other intermediaries have the discretion to vote on routine matters, such as Proposal Five, but do not have discretion to vote on non-routine matters such as Proposals One, Two, Three, Four, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to that organization, it may vote your shares only on Proposal Five and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; What is the effect of a broker &#8220;non-vote&#8221;? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; An organization that holds shares of Tesla&#8217;s common stock for a beneficial owner will have the discretion to vote on routine proposals if it has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the 2024 Annual Meeting. A broker &#8220;non-vote&#8221; occurs when a broker, bank or other intermediary that is otherwise counted as present or represented by proxy does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to vote the shares. A broker &#8220;non-vote&#8221; will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the 2024 Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal as to which that broker &#8220;non-vote&#8221; occurs. Thus, a broker &#8220;non-vote&#8221; will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum for the 2024 Annual Meeting and will not otherwise affect the approval by a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote of any of the Proposals One, Two, Four, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; With respect to Proposal Three, broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against (under the Conversion Standard). &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; As described above, broker non-votes are not expected to occur in connection with Proposal Five. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; How does the Board recommend that I vote? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; The Board recommends that you vote your shares: &#187; &#8220; FOR &#8221; the two nominees for election as Class&#160;II directors (&#8220;Proposal One&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; FOR &#8221; the approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of executive compensation (&#8220;Proposal Two&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; FOR &#8221; the approval of the redomestication of Tesla from Delaware to Texas by conversion (&#8220;Proposal Three&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; FOR &#8221; the ratification of the 100% performance-based stock option award to Elon Musk that was proposed to and approved by our stockholders in 2018 (&#8220;Proposal Four&#8221;); &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 2024 Proxy Statement&#160;&#160;&#160; 163 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#187; &#8220; FOR &#8221; the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Tesla&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&#160;31, 2024 (&#8220;Proposal Five&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding reduction of director terms to one year (&#8220;Proposal&#160;Six&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding simple majority voting provisions in our governing documents (&#8220;Proposal Seven&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8220; the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding annual reporting on anti-harassment and discrimination efforts (&#8220;Proposal Eight&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8220; the approval of the stockholder proposal adoption of a freedom of association and collective bargaining policy (&#8220;Proposal Nine&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding reporting on effects and risks associated with electromagnetic radiation and wireless technologies (&#8220;Proposal Ten&#8221;); &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding adopting targets and reporting on metrics to assess the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics into senior executive compensation plans (&#8220;Proposal Eleven&#8221;); and &#8203; &#187; &#8220; AGAINST &#8221; the approval of the stockholder proposal regarding committing to a moratorium on sourcing minerals from deep sea mining (&#8220;Proposal Twelve&#8221;). &#8203; &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; What happens if additional matters are presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the 2024 Annual Meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the 2024 Annual Meeting to another time or place, the persons named as proxy holders, Vaibhav Taneja and Brandon Ehrhart, or either of them, will have discretion to vote the proxies held by them on those matters in accordance with their best judgment. Tesla does not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; Can I change my vote? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; You retain the power to change or revoke you proxy at any time before it is voted at the 2024 Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote (i)&#160;by submitting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) using any of the voting methods described above in the question entitled &#8220; How can I vote my shares without attending the 2024 Annual Meeting? ,&#8221; &#8203;(ii)&#160;by providing a written notice of revocation to Tesla, Inc., 1 Tesla Road, Austin, Texas 78725, Attention: Legal Department, with a copy sent by e-mail to shareholdermail@tesla.com, prior to your shares being voted, or (iii)&#160;by attending the 2024 Annual Meeting and voting in person or virtually via the Internet, which will supersede any proxy previously submitted by you. However, merely attending the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically request it. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may generally change your vote by (i)&#160;submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other intermediary or (ii)&#160;if you have obtained a &#8220;legal proxy&#8221; from the organization that holds your shares giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the 2024 Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, please consult that organization for any specific rules it may have regarding your ability to change your voting instructions. &#8203; &#160; 164 &#160;&#160;&#160;2024 Proxy Statement TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Q &#8203; &#8203; What should I do if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability, notice from my broker, bank or other intermediary, or set of proxy materials? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; You may receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability, notice from your broker, bank or other intermediary, or set of proxy materials, including multiple copies of proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you are a beneficial owner with shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate notice or voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each Tesla proxy card or voting instruction card that you receive, and/or follow the voting instructions on each Notice of Internet Availability or other notice you receive, to ensure that all your shares are voted. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; Is my vote confidential? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within Tesla or to third parties, except: (i)&#160;as necessary for applicable legal requirements, (ii)&#160;to allow for the tabulation and certification of the votes and (iii)&#160;to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to Tesla management. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; Who will serve as inspector of election? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; The inspector of election will be The Carideo Group, an independent corporate election inspection service. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; Where can I find the voting results of the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; We will publish final voting results in our Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC and made available on its website at www.sec.gov within four (4)&#160;business days of the 2024 Annual Meeting. &#8203; Q &#8203; &#8203; Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the 2024 Annual Meeting? &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; Tesla&#8217;s Board of Directors is soliciting your vote for matters being submitted for stockholder approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Tesla will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. We may reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons representing beneficial owners for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to those beneficial owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person, telephonically, electronically or by other means. These directors, officers and employees will not be additionally compensated but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in doing so. &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; We have retained Innisfree M&amp;A Incorporated, 501 Madison Avenue, 20th&#160;Floor, New York, NY&#160;10022, to aid in the solicitation.

If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the shareholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60&#160;days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining shareholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating&#160;thereto. 2.12&#160;&#160;&#160;PROXIES Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after eleven&#160;months from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Sections&#160;21.368 and 21.369 of the TBOC. A written proxy may be in the form of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the person and as provided in Section&#160;21.367 of the TBOC.

The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be kept on file at the registered office or principal executive office of the corporation for at least 10&#160;days prior to the date of the applicable meeting, and shall be open to the examination of any shareholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10&#160;days prior to the meeting (i)&#160;on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)&#160;during ordinary business hours, at the corporation&#8217;s principal place of business. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the corporation. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. 2.14&#160;&#160;&#160;INSPECTORS OF ELECTION Before any meeting of shareholders, the board of directors shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1)&#160;or three&#160;(3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder&#8217;s proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed and designated shall (i)&#160;ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each share, (ii)&#160;determine the shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii)&#160;count all votes and ballots, (iv)&#160;determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v)&#160;certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such inspector or inspectors&#8217; count of all votes and ballots. &#160; C-10 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of shareholders of the corporation, the inspector or inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. If there are three (3)&#160;inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. 2.15&#160;&#160;&#160;PROXY ACCESS (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;Whenever the board of directors solicits proxies with respect to the election of directors at an annual meeting, subject to the provisions of this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation shall include in its proxy statement for such annual meeting, in addition to any persons nominated for election by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the &#8220; Shareholder Nominee &#8221;) to the board of directors by an Eligible Shareholder (as defined in Section&#160;2.15(iv)) that expressly elects at the time of providing the notice required by this Section&#160;2.15 to have such nominee included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15. For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, the &#8220; Required Information &#8221; that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (A)&#160;the information provided to the secretary of the corporation concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that is required to be disclosed in the corporation&#8217;s proxy statement pursuant to Section&#160;14 of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (B)&#160;if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a Supporting Statement (as defined in Section&#160;2.15(viii)). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section&#160;2.15 shall limit the corporation&#8217;s ability to solicit against any Shareholder Nominee or include in its proxy materials the corporation&#8217;s own statements or other information relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15. Subject to the provisions of this Section&#160;2.15, the name of any Shareholder Nominee included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy statement for an annual meeting shall also be set forth on the form of proxy distributed by the corporation in connection with such annual meeting. (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by an Eligible Shareholder pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, the Eligible Shareholder must have given timely notice of such nomination (the &#8220; Notice of Proxy Access Nomination &#8221;) in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 120&#160;days nor more than 150&#160;days prior to the first anniversary of the date that the corporation first distributed its proxy statement to shareholders for the immediately preceding annual meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Notice of Proxy Access Nomination pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15. (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;The maximum number of Shareholder Nominees nominated by all Eligible Shareholders that will be included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting shall not exceed the greater of (A)&#160;two or (B)&#160;20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Notice of Proxy Access Nomination may be delivered pursuant to and in accordance with this Section&#160;2.15 (the &#8220; Final Proxy Access Nomination Date &#8221;) or, if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below 20% (such greater number, as it may be adjusted pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, the &#8220; Permitted Number &#8221;). In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the board of directors after the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date but before the date of the annual meeting and the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board of directors in connection therewith, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. For purposes of determining when the Permitted Number has been reached, each of the following persons shall be counted as one of the Shareholder Nominees: (A)&#160;any individual nominated by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 whose nomination is subsequently withdrawn, (B)&#160;any individual nominated by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 whom the board of directors decides to nominate for election to the board of directors and (C)&#160;any director in office as of the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date who was included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials as a Shareholder Nominee for either of the two preceding annual meetings (including any individual counted as a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (B)) and whom the board of directors decides to nominate for re-election to the board of directors. Any Eligible Shareholder submitting more than one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 shall rank such Shareholder Nominees based on the order in which the Eligible Shareholder desires such Shareholder &#160; C-11 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials in the event that the total number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 exceeds the Permitted Number. In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 exceeds the Permitted Number, the highest ranking Shareholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section&#160;2.15 from each Eligible Shareholder will be selected for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of capital stock of the corporation each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its Notice of Proxy Access Nomination. If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Shareholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section&#160;2.15 from each Eligible Shareholder has been selected, then the next highest ranking Shareholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section&#160;2.15 from each Eligible Shareholder will be selected for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials, and this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation shall not be required to include any Shareholder Nominees in its proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 for any meeting of shareholders for which the secretary of the corporation receives notice (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) that a shareholder intends to nominate one or more persons for election to the board of directors pursuant to the advance notice requirements for shareholder nominees set forth in Section&#160;2.4. (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;An &#8220; Eligible Shareholder &#8221; is a shareholder or group of no more than 20 shareholders (counting as one shareholder, for this purpose, any two or more funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group (as defined below)) that (A)&#160;has owned (as defined in Section&#160;2.15(v)) continuously for at least three&#160;years (the &#8220; Minimum Holding Period &#8221;) a number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that represents at least 3% of the corporation&#8217;s outstanding capital stock as of the date the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation in accordance with this Section&#160;2.15 (the &#8220; Required Shares &#8221;), (B)&#160;continues to own the Required Shares through the date of the annual meeting and (C)&#160;satisfies all other requirements of, and complies with all applicable procedures set forth in, this Section&#160;2.15. A &#8220; Qualifying Fund&#160;Group &#8221; is a group of two or more funds that are (A)&#160;under common management and investment control, (B)&#160;under common management and funded primarily by the same employer or (C)&#160;a &#8220;group of investment companies&#8221; as such term is defined in Section&#160;13(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Whenever the Eligible Shareholder consists of a group of shareholders (including a group of funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group), (A)&#160;each provision in this Section&#160;2.15 that requires the Eligible Shareholder to provide any written statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments or to meet any other conditions shall be deemed to require each shareholder (including each individual fund) that is a member of such group to provide such statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments and to meet such other conditions (except that the members of such group may aggregate the shares that each member has owned continuously for the Minimum Holding Period in order to meet the 3% ownership requirement of the &#8220;Required Shares&#8221; definition) and (B)&#160;a breach of any obligation, agreement or representation under this Section&#160;2.15 by any member of such group shall be deemed a breach by the Eligible Shareholder. No person may be a member of more than one group of shareholders constituting an Eligible Shareholder with respect to any annual meeting. (v)&#160;&#160;&#160;For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, an Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed to &#8220; own &#8221; only those outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation as to which the shareholder possesses both (A)&#160;the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (B)&#160;the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit from and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A)&#160;and (B)&#160;shall not include any shares (1)&#160;sold by such shareholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2)&#160;borrowed by such shareholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or (3)&#160;subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such shareholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares of outstanding capital stock of the corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (x)&#160;reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such shareholder&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and/or (y)&#160;hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree any gain or loss realized or realizable from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or affiliate. For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, a shareholder shall &#8220;own&#8221; shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder retains the &#160; C-12 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A shareholder&#8217;s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (A)&#160;the shareholder has loaned such shares; provided that the shareholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days&#8217; notice and includes in its Notice of Proxy Access Nomination an agreement that it (1)&#160;will promptly recall such loaned shares upon being notified that any of its Shareholder Nominees will be included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials and (2)&#160;will continue to hold such recalled shares through the date of the annual meeting or (B)&#160;the shareholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is revocable at any time by the shareholder. The terms &#8220;owned,&#8221; &#8220;owning&#8221; and other variations of the word &#8220;own&#8221; shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation are &#8220;owned&#8221; for these purposes shall be determined by the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof). For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, the term &#8220; affiliate &#8221; or &#8220; affiliates &#8221; shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the 1934 Act. (vi)&#160;&#160;&#160;To be in proper written form for purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must include or be accompanied by the following: (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;a written statement by the Eligible Shareholder certifying as to the number of shares it owns and has owned continuously for the Minimum Holding Period, and the Eligible Shareholder&#8217;s agreement to provide (1)&#160;within five business days following the later of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed, a written statement by the Eligible Shareholder certifying as to the number of shares it owns and has owned continuously through the record date and (2)&#160;immediate notice if the Eligible Shareholder ceases to own any of the Required Shares prior to the date of the annual meeting;

(f)&#160;&#160;&#160;an undertaking that the Eligible Shareholder agrees to (1)&#160;assume all liability stemming from any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Shareholder&#8217;s communications with the shareholders of the corporation or out of the information that the Eligible Shareholder provided to the corporation, (2)&#160;indemnify and hold harmless the corporation and each of its directors, officers and employees individually against any liability, loss or damages in connection with any threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, whether legal, administrative or investigative, against the corporation or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of any nomination submitted by the Eligible Shareholder pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 or any solicitation or other activity in connection therewith and (3)&#160;file with the SEC any solicitation or other communication with the shareholders of the corporation relating to the meeting at which its Shareholder Nominee(s) will be nominated, regardless of whether any such filing is required under Regulation&#160;14A of the 1934 Act or whether any exemption from filing is available for such solicitation or other communication under Regulation&#160;14A of the 1934 Act; (g)&#160;&#160;&#160;the written representation and agreement from each Shareholder Nominee that such person (1)&#160;is not and will not become a party to (x)&#160;any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a &#8220; Voting Commitment &#8221;) that has not been disclosed to the corporation in such representation and agreement or (y)&#160;any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person&#8217;s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation, with such person&#8217;s fiduciary duties under applicable law; (2)&#160;is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed to the corporation in such representation and agreement;

and (4)&#160;will make such other acknowledgments, enter into such agreements and provide such information as the board of directors requires of all directors, including promptly submitting all completed and signed questionnaires required of the corporation&#8217;s directors;

and (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;in the case of a nomination by a group of shareholders together constituting an Eligible Shareholder in which two or more funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group are counted as one shareholder for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder, documentation reasonably satisfactory to the corporation that demonstrates that the funds are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group. (vii)&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to the information required pursuant to Section&#160;2.15(vi) or any other provision of these bylaws, (A)&#160;the corporation may require any proposed Shareholder Nominee to furnish any other information (1)&#160;that may reasonably be requested by the corporation to determine whether the Shareholder Nominee would be independent under the rules and listing standards of the principal United States securities exchanges upon which the capital stock of the corporation is listed or traded, any applicable rules of the SEC or any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the corporation&#8217;s directors (collectively, the &#8220; Independence Standards &#8221;), (2)&#160;that could be material to a reasonable shareholder&#8217;s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such Shareholder Nominee or (3)&#160;that may reasonably be requested by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such Shareholder Nominee to be included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 or to serve as a director of the corporation, and (B)&#160;the corporation may require the Eligible Shareholder to furnish any other &#160; C-14 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; information that may reasonably be requested by the corporation to verify the Eligible Shareholder&#8217;s continuous ownership of the Required Shares for the Minimum Holding Period. (viii)&#160;&#160;&#160;The Eligible Shareholder may, at its option, provide to the secretary of the corporation, at the time the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is provided, a written statement, not to exceed 500 words, in support of the candidacy of the Shareholder Nominee(s) (a &#8220; Supporting Statement &#8221;). Only one Supporting Statement may be submitted by an Eligible Shareholder (including any group of shareholders together constituting an Eligible Shareholder) in support of its Shareholder Nominee(s). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Supporting Statement (or portion thereof) that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law or regulation. (ix)&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that any information or communications provided by an Eligible Shareholder or a Shareholder Nominee to the corporation or its shareholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the secretary of the corporation of any such defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood that providing such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies available to the corporation relating to any such defect (including the right to omit a Shareholder Nominee from its proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15). In addition, any person providing any information to the corporation pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 shall further update and supplement such information, if necessary, so that all such information shall be true and correct as of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than five business days following the later of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed. (x)&#160;&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation shall not be required to include in its proxy materials, pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, any Shareholder Nominee (A)&#160;who would not be an independent director under the Independence Standards, (B)&#160;whose election as a member of the board of directors would cause the corporation to be in violation of these bylaws, the certificate of formation, the rules and listing standards of the principal United States securities exchanges upon which the capital stock of the corporation is listed or traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation, (C)&#160;who is or has been, within the past three&#160;years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section&#160;8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, (D)&#160;who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past 10&#160;years, (E)&#160;who is subject to any order of the type specified in Rule&#160;506(d) of Regulation&#160;D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (F)&#160;who shall have provided any information to the corporation or its shareholders that was untrue in any material respect or that omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (xi)&#160;&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if (A)&#160;a Shareholder Nominee and/or the applicable Eligible Shareholder breaches any of its agreements or representations or fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Section&#160;2.15 or (B)&#160;a Shareholder Nominee otherwise becomes ineligible for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 or dies, becomes disabled or otherwise becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting, in each case as determined by the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the chairman of the annual meeting, (1)&#160;the corporation may omit or, to the extent feasible, remove the information concerning such Shareholder Nominee and the related Supporting Statement from its proxy materials and/or otherwise communicate to its shareholders that such Shareholder Nominee will not be eligible for election at the annual meeting, (2)&#160;the corporation shall not be required to include in its proxy materials any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the applicable Eligible Shareholder or any other Eligible Shareholder and (3)&#160;the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the chairman of the annual meeting shall declare such nomination to be invalid and such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. In addition, if the Eligible Shareholder (or a representative thereof) does not appear at the annual meeting to present any nomination pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, such nomination shall be declared invalid and disregarded as provided in clause (3)&#160;above. &#160; C-15 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; (xii)&#160;&#160;&#160;Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials for a particular annual meeting but either (A)&#160;withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting, or (B)&#160;does not receive at least 25% of the votes cast in favor of such Shareholder Nominee&#8217;s election, will be ineligible to be a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 for the next two annual meetings. For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall not prevent any shareholder from nominating any person to the board of directors pursuant to and in accordance with Section&#160;2.4. Other than Rule&#160;14a-19 under the 1934 Act, this Section&#160;2.15 provides the exclusive method for a shareholder to include nominees for election to the board of directors in the corporation&#8217;s proxy statement. ARTICLE III&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;DIRECTORS 3.1&#160;&#160;&#160;POWERS The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in the TBOC or the certificate of formation. 3.2&#160;&#160;&#160;NUMBER OF DIRECTORS The board of directors shall consist of one or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. Unless the certificate of formation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time solely by resolution of the board of directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director&#8217;s term of office expires. 3.3&#160;&#160;&#160;ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS Except as provided in Section&#160;3.4 of these bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until such director&#8217;s successor is elected and qualified or until such director&#8217;s earlier death, resignation or removal. Directors need not be shareholders unless so required by the certificate of formation or these bylaws. The certificate of formation or these bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. 3.4&#160;&#160;&#160;RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation; provided, however , that if such notice is given by electronic transmission, such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the director. A resignation is effective when the resignation is received by the corporation unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. Acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of formation or these bylaws, when one or more directors resign from the board of directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have the power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of formation or these bylaws, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled in any manner permitted by the TBOC, including by (1)&#160;the board of directors at any meeting of the board of directors by vote of a majority of the remaining members of the board of directors, although less than a quorum, or (2)&#160;a sole remaining director, in each case to the extent permitted by the TBOC; provided , that the term of any director appointed by the majority of the directors then in office to fill a vacancy shall last only until the next annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting of shareholders called to vote on the election of directors. If the directors are divided into classes, a person so elected or appointed to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. &#160; C-16 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 3.5&#160;&#160;&#160;PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE The board of directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Texas. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of formation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.6&#160;&#160;&#160;REGULAR MEETINGS Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board of directors. 3.7&#160;&#160;&#160;SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairperson of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president, the secretary or a majority of the authorized number of directors, at such times and places as he or she or they shall designate.

If the notice is sent by United States mail, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice may be communicated to the director. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting (if the meeting is to be held at the corporation&#8217;s principal executive office) nor the purpose of the meeting. 3.8&#160;&#160;&#160;QUORUM; VOTING At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the total authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. The vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the certificate of formation or these bylaws. To the maximum extent permitted by the TBOC, in the event a director or directors abstain or are disqualified from a vote, the majority vote of the director or the directors thereof not abstaining or disqualified from voting, whether or not such director or directors constitute a quorum, shall be the act of the board of directors. If the certificate of formation provides that one or more directors shall have more or less than one vote per director on any matter, every reference in these bylaws to a majority or other proportion of the directors shall refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of the directors. &#160; C-17 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 3.9&#160;&#160;&#160;BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of formation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board of directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board of directors or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. 3.10&#160;&#160;&#160;FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of formation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. 3.11&#160;&#160;&#160;REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS A director may be removed from office by the shareholders of the corporation only for cause. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director&#8217;s term of office. ARTICLE IV&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;COMMITTEES 4.1&#160;&#160;&#160;COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS The board of directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board of directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by facsimile telecommunication, when transmitted to a number at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by electronic mail, when transmitted to an electronic mail address at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A)&#160;such posting and (B)&#160;the giving of such separate notice; and (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by any other form of electronic transmission, when communicated to the shareholder.

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person participates in or attends a meeting solely to object to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareholders or the board of directors, as the case may be, need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of formation or these bylaws.

The Committee considered these questions over the course of 8 weeks, meeting 16 times and working extensively with independent legal, academic, and financial advisors. In the Committee&#8217;s business judgment, reincorporating in Texas and ratifying Musk&#8217;s compensation are in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders, and should be voted for by stockholders at Tesla&#8217;s 2024 annual meeting. A. Why Reincorporate In Texas? &#8203; Texas Is Tesla&#8217;s Home, And Aligns With Its Mission. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee considered a precise question: where should this Company be incorporated at this time . It started from a blank slate, considering all US states as well as the possibility of incorporating outside of the US. It narrowed its focus in stages, first to 10 states, then 5, and finally to a binary choice between remaining incorporated in Delaware and reincorporating in one alternative jurisdiction. At each stage, the Committee conducted an increasingly in-depth analysis of factors it believed were relevant to Tesla. The Committee narrowed its focus to US jurisdictions because Tesla is an American company. It selected 10 states for further consideration&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;because each has a significant number of major public companies incorporated in them, and because Tesla&#8217;s most significant US operations are in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas. For this group of 10, the Committee reviewed each state&#8217;s corporate laws at a high level and concluded they were substantially similar. The Committee therefore saw no reason to move to a jurisdiction Tesla has no current significant connection to, and narrowed its focus to 5 states: California, which has two factories; Delaware, the current state of incorporation; New York, which has a Gigafactory; Nevada, which also has a Gigafactory; and Texas, which is Tesla&#8217;s corporate headquarters and has a Gigafactory. The Committee then conducted further analysis, including of academic scholarship on the development of corporate law in the US and on companies&#8217; incorporation decisions. The Committee continued to find no reason to pick one jurisdiction based on its corporate law. This was not surprising, as each state&#8217;s law operates under the same federal constitutional framework, draws on a common law heritage, and evolved in light of&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and in competition with&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;each other. The differentiator at this stage therefore became Tesla&#8217;s home state. Academic research shows that companies overwhelmingly incorporate either in Delaware or in their home state, and identifies a range of reasons for this. So the Committee determined that the best potential alternative to Delaware was Texas, and resolved to choose between those two states. The Committee then conducted a thorough, holistic examination of all considerations it believed were relevant to deciding between Delaware and Texas. Ultimately, the Committee found that the corporate laws of Delaware and Texas are substantially equivalent, at least on net and as relevant to Tesla. Governance rights are effectively the same in both states, with the key exception that Texas requires that stockholders have the right to call a special meeting whereas Delaware does not. Stockholder litigation rights in Texas are robust&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they are certainly not lesser than in Delaware. And, in addition to its own analysis with its advisors, the Committee took note of ISS&#8217;s prior statement that &#8220;reincorporation from Delaware to Texas would appear to have a neutral impact on shareholders&#8217; rights,&#8221; and Glass Lewis&#8217;s prior statement that &#8220;in most respects, the corporate statutes in Delaware and Texas are comparable.&#8221; 1 Both have previously recommended voting in favor of multiple Delaware-to-Texas reincorporations. The Committee also concluded there is no reason to believe that being incorporated in Delaware increases Tesla&#8217;s market value. Of the S&amp;P 500, 35% are domiciled outside of Delaware. Seven of the top 20 by market capitalization are incorporated in their home state: Apple, Costco, Eli Lilly, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Microsoft, and Proctor &amp; Gamble. Tesla would make 8. Notably, the Committee saw no indication that Microsoft&#8217;s earlier reincorporation from Delaware to its home state of Washington had a negative effect on its market value. This left the Committee to weigh three factors. First, Tesla is all-in on Texas. The Gigafactory in Austin is the home of Tesla&#8217;s corporate leadership, and is the Company&#8217;s largest and most strategically-important factory. And Tesla&#8217;s corporate identity is increasingly intertwined with Texas. The Committee believes that, as a matter of first &#8203; 1 ISS (2019); Glass Lewis (2019). &#160; E-3 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; principles, Tesla should have an affirmative reason to be legally incorporated in a different state than its physical headquarters. The Committee found no advantage to remaining incorporated in Delaware that justified splitting Tesla&#8217;s legal home from its physical home, but did see value in unifying them. Second, Tesla is a mission-driven company. The mission to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy is fundamental to Tesla&#8217;s culture, and is critical to recruitment, motivation, and retention from the factory floor to the boardroom. Texas has an express statutory provision that would allow (though not require) Tesla&#8217;s directors and officers to consider the Company&#8217;s mission in exercising their fiduciary duties; Delaware does not. The Committee believes this distinction matters to Tesla. The difference may be more symbolic than actual&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Tesla&#8217;s mission has, after all, driven it since its founding. But symbolism matters to corporate culture. Texas law on this point better aligns with Tesla&#8217;s mission, and that has value. Third, the Committee considered the likely relative predictability of Delaware and Texas law based on differences in their judicial systems. Delaware has the most respected corporate judicial system in the country and the most extensive body of corporate case law. In contrast, Texas is just now forming specialized business courts and has much less corporate case law. The Committee concluded, however, that this factor did not alter its balance. The Committee was persuaded by the broadly held academic view&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;echoed by at least 3 former Delaware Supreme Court Justices and 1 former Chancellor&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that Delaware law can be indeterminate because of its use of broad, flexible standards that are applied to individual cases in a highly fact-specific way. This focus on precise facts and circumstances means Delaware decisions may be less predictable for an innovative company like Tesla. Moreover, the Committee does not think that Texas&#8217;s business courts should be avoided simply because they are new. Doing new things is part of Tesla&#8217;s DNA and how it has become one of the most valuable companies in the world. On balance, the Committee&#8217;s business judgment is that reincorporating in Texas is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders. Why Did This Committee Consider The Incorporation Question Now? Whether to reincorporate is not a new question for Tesla. The Committee confirmed that the Company&#8217;s management and certain of its outside directors have been exploring the issue without reaching a decision since Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas in 2021. The question came up again after the Delaware Court of Chancery invalidated Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan on January&#160;30, 2024. Later that day, Musk ran a poll on X asking whether Tesla should &#8220;change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?&#8221; Of 1,102,554 votes on X, 87.1% were in favor. The next day, Musk posted that &#8220;Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.&#8221; Whether to put reincorporation to a stockholder vote is a decision for Tesla&#8217;s Board, not Musk alone. And it is a decision that should be made based on a full assessment of the merits, not in reaction to a court case. So the Board created this Special Committee on February&#160;10, and charged it with independently evaluating reincorporation and making a final determination. B. Why Ratify Musk&#8217;s 2018 Compensation Plan? &#8203; Stockholders Should Decide Musk&#8217;s Compensation. &#160;&#160;&#160;In Spring 2018, Tesla&#8217;s Board and stockholders voted to award Musk performance-based compensation worth up to $55.8&#160;billion, if approximately $600&#160;billion of stockholder value was created. More than 63&#160;million disinterested shares&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;73% of disinterested votes cast&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;approved the compensation. Adjusted for stock splits, that is equivalent to 945&#160;million shares today. In June&#160;2018, a stockholder with 9 shares filed a lawsuit called Tornetta challenging the compensation in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Five and a half&#160;years later, the court invalidated the compensation, finding, among other things, that the 2018 stockholder vote was not fully informed. As a result, Musk has not been directly paid for his work at Tesla since 2018, even though he led the Company in creating more than $600&#160;billion in stockholder value. As the Delaware Court of Chancery has recently noted, &#8220;Delaware law offers solutions for missteps.&#8221; 2 One such solution is ratification&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;essentially, a re-approval of a prior action. The Committee concluded that Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan should be put to a new stockholder vote. This will give all of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders their voice back. They will get to decide Musk&#8217;s compensation, with full knowledge of everything criticized in Tornetta . &#8203; 2 Sjunde AP-Fonden v. Activision Blizzard, Inc. , 2024 WL 863290, at *10 (Del. Ch. Ct. Feb. 29, 2024). &#160; E-4 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Since the Tornetta ruling, many stockholders have expressed their support for Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan. Dozens of institutional stockholders have, unprompted, told the Company&#8217;s Investor Relations team that they think the 2018 compensation plan should be fixed. Seven institutional stockholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including 4 of the top 10&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;felt strongly enough to go straight to the Board Chair to say that. One of those top 10 stockholders followed up in writing: With regard to the 2018 [compensation], we do not think it&#8217;s fair to set out a new set of options subject to a fresh set of performance hurdles. The requirements of the 2018 package were extraordinarily ambitious&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; and they were delivered . It is not reasonable for investors to expect to re-absorb the canceled options and consider all that value creation to have been delivered to us for no consideration. Therefore, if it is legally advisable, we suggest simply subjecting the original 2018 package to a new shareholder vote. 3 Additionally, thousands of retail stockholders representing more than 23&#160;million combined shares&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;equivalent to the 11th largest institutional stockholder&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;have sent unsolicited letters and emails to the Board or to the Tornetta court expressing the same sentiment. One letter sent on behalf of 5,821 stockholders stated: As Tesla shareholders, we want our shareholder votes to count (not be rescinded&#160;years later); we want Tesla CEO Elon Musk to be compensated for his Past Work (that is keep ALL stock options previously awarded for meeting the 2018 Musk Incentive Comp Plan milestones). . . . [We] [w]ould like the Board to explore options to affirm the shareholder vote in support of keeping [&#8199;&#8199;] Tesla&#8217;s 2018 CEO Compensation Plan active and in place. 4 A ratification vote will give all stockholders the opportunity to speak on Musk&#8217;s compensation and determine whether it is in their best interests. On the flip side, the alternative&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not seeking a ratification vote&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is not in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. Musk, like most people, wants to be treated fairly and to be paid for his work as agreed, and his ownership interest in Tesla is important to him. He has confirmed this to the Committee. And motivating him to devote his time and energy to Tesla is essential to the Company. Negotiating (or renegotiating) a replacement compensation plan that Musk would agree to would likely take substantial time in light of the Tornetta decision, and incur a new, incremental accounting charge of billions of dollars. Ratification would be faster, would avoid any new compensation expense, and would avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty regarding Tesla&#8217;s most important employee. To be clear, the Committee did not substantively re-evaluate the amount or terms of Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan. It did not run a new compensation process and did not hire compensation consultants. It did not negotiate with Musk. None of that would have been consistent with ratification. Ratification is a tool to fix a procedural error or endorse a prior action. In the Committee&#8217;s business judgment, that tool should be used here and now. Why Did This Committee Consider The Ratification Question Now? Ratification came to this Committee because of the reincorporation question. In thinking through various scenarios for how any decision on reincorporation could play out, and observing the widespread interest in reincorporation and Tornetta from stockholders and the media, the Committee determined that disclosures for a possible stockholder vote on reincorporation would need to address Musk&#8217;s compensation. Otherwise, a potential reincorporation could have been wrongly perceived as being made as a direct reaction to the Tornetta ruling, and with the intent to award Musk compensation in a different jurisdiction that he could not get in Delaware. And, if stockholders were not told of any then-existing plans for Musk&#8217;s compensation, the reincorporation vote could be subject to attack as not fully informed. The Committee therefore requested and received the additional authority to address ratification, so that Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan could be resolved under Delaware law even if Tesla reincorporated to another jurisdiction. C. The Committee. &#8203; The Committee&#8217;s Authority And Advisors. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee had the authority to make a final decision on the incorporation question, including to choose to remain in Delaware. It had the authority to make a final decision on &#8203; 3 4/10/24 Letter to Board Chair Robyn Denholm from T. Rowe Price (emphasis in original). 4 2/5/24 Letter to the Board of Directors from Amy Steffens and Alexandra Merz on behalf of 5,821 stockholders holding 23,337,127 shares (with 196-page spreadsheet identifying those stockholders). &#160; E-5 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; the ratification question, including to reject ratification. And it had all of the powers and resources needed to fully address both questions. Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is the sole member of this Committee. The Committee was initially constituted with two members, but one of them stepped down from the Committee before any substantive decisions were made, for reasons addressed later in this Report. Wilson-Thompson is an outside director who joined Tesla&#8217;s Board in December&#160;2018. She has served in senior management and director roles at public companies for three decades, rising through the ranks to the C-Suite at two iconic Fortune 500 public companies. Among other positions, she served as the Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, and she is currently a director of McKesson and Wolverine World Wide. She was a practicing lawyer before pivoting to management. After interviewing multiple law firms, the Committee selected Kristen Seeger and John Skakun of Sidley Austin LLP as its legal counsel. Seeger is a member of Sidley&#8217;s Executive Committee and co-leads the firm&#8217;s global Commercial Litigation and Disputes practice. Seeger and Skakun have led some of the largest securities class actions and fiduciary duty cases in the nation. They regularly represent public companies, boards, and special committees in high-profile and sensitive matters. Both are leading members of Sidley&#8217;s &#8220;dominant and highly acclaimed&#8221; Securities and Shareholder Litigation practice, which has &#8220;outstanding expertise across the board.&#8221; 5 Seeger and Skakun involved leading Sidley lawyers with decades of experience with Delaware and Texas law, including Gary Gerstman, Yolanda Garcia, and George Vlahakos, and brought talent from across the firm to bear on the representation. The Committee was also advised by highly-regarded Delaware counsel, A. Thompson Bayliss of Abrams &amp; Bayliss LLP; a corporate law and governance expert, Professor Anthony Casey of the University of Chicago Law School; and a financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. The Committee&#8217;s Process. &#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past 8 weeks, the Committee and its advisors devoted substantial time and attention to this matter. The Committee formally met 16 times for more than 26 total hours. Outside of meetings, Wilson-Thompson spent more than 200 hours working on this matter, including reviewing a significant amount of written materials and communicating further with counsel. Seeger and Skakun personally spent more than 600 hours each on the matter. They were assisted by more than 40 other Sidley lawyers. The Committee and its counsel had extraordinary access to and assistance from the Company. Every request for information or resources was fully granted. All 7 other directors and 5 members of management were interviewed. And, at the Committee&#8217;s request, its counsel visited the Company&#8217;s headquarters. The Committee took the time it needed. At the outset, the Committee worked with its counsel to assess the time necessary to conduct a thorough, well-designed process. The Committee decided that, if it determined that any matter should be voted on by stockholders, the vote should be at Tesla&#8217;s annual meeting because that would give the greatest number of stockholders an opportunity to voice their views. So the Committee&#8217;s counsel sought to have the previously-selected date for the annual meeting pushed back by more than a month, in order to give the Committee the time that it deemed appropriate to complete its process. Following a negotiation over various potential dates, the Company agreed to the Committee&#8217;s request and moved the date of the annual meeting from May&#160;8 to June&#160;13, 2024. The Committee always reserved the right to take additional time if necessary, and expressly stated that to the Company. The Committee reached its final decisions on reincorporation and on ratification on its own timeline, and would have taken additional time for either question if it believed that was necessary. Independence. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee and its counsel are aware of the media narrative regarding Musk, Tesla, and its Board. And the Committee&#8217;s work was conducted against a backdrop of unrelenting public interest in whether Tesla would reincorporate and in Musk&#8217;s compensation. Far from being influenced by these factors, this outside narrative and attention intensified the commitment of the Committee and its counsel to conduct a staunchly independent process. Counsel to the Committee assessed the independence and disinterestedness of Wilson-Thompson, and determined that she was independent and disinterested in considering both the incorporation and the ratification questions. Wilson-Thompson expressly confirmed that she was willing and able to decide (i)&#160;that Tesla remain a &#8203; 5 Chambers USA 2023: Litigation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Securities | Illinois. &#160; E-6 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Delaware corporation regardless of the views of Musk and (ii)&#160;that his 2018 compensation plan should not be ratified, if those decisions would be in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders. Throughout the process, counsel to the Committee observed Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s independence. Seeger and Skakun participated in every Committee meeting with her, and had near-daily communications with her. They never observed anything remotely resembling a so-called &#8220;controlled mindset.&#8221; To the contrary, Wilson-Thompson focused solely on the merits of the questions before the Committee, and on reaching decisions based on the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. Further, Musk made no attempt to influence or control the Committee. He did not directly or indirectly communicate with Wilson-Thompson about the Committee&#8217;s work, except in an interview conducted by counsel after she reached her decisions. The Committee also concluded that its advisors are independent. Sidley has never represented Musk. It represented Tesla in 2017 and 2021 in two small matters and was paid $12,601 in total. Sidley is a global law firm with 21 offices, approximately 2,300 lawyers, and $3&#160;billion in revenue in 2023. Sidley represents 38 of the Fortune 50, 258 of the Fortune 500, and more than 1,000 public companies. It has top-ranked practices in all areas relevant to the Committee&#8217;s work, and is particularly well-known for its premier public company advisory, corporate governance, and shareholder litigation practices. Similarly, the Committee&#8217;s Delaware counsel, corporate law and governance expert, and financial advisor were also determined to be independent. D. This Report. &#8203; This Report reflects the business judgment of the Committee, and states its beliefs and opinions based on its work and knowledge. It proceeds in three Parts. Part&#160;1 explains the Committee&#8217;s decisions on incorporation and on ratification. It walks through the considerations the Committee weighed and how it reached its decisions. Part&#160;2 addresses the Committee&#8217;s process. It describes the Committee&#8217;s creation and mandate, and how it became a single-member committee. It explains why the Committee and its advisors believe they are independent. It also provides an overview of the Committee&#8217;s activities. Part&#160;3 describes how the Committee used Delaware cases to cross-check its work. This cross-check provided additional validation for the Committee of the design and execution of its process, and of its intent to follow Delaware law even as the law developed during this process. &#160; E-7 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Part&#160;1: The Special Committee&#8217;s Decisions And Reasoning I. The Committee&#8217;s Reincorporation Decision. &#8203; A. The Committee&#8217;s Evaluation Of Jurisdictions. &#8203; At the outset of its work on incorporation, the Committee resolved to be guided by several propositions: It would approach incorporation from first principles. It would accord no weight to Musk&#8217;s posts on X or to any prior work by the Company on reincorporation. It would consult with and rely on any and all independent advisors it deemed necessary. It would take the time needed to thoroughly evaluate relevant considerations. It would assess what is in the best interests of this Company and all of its stockholders at this time. The Committee constructed a decision process that was consistent with these guideposts. It would start with all 50 US states as well as international jurisdictions, and then narrow its focus in stages. At each stage, the Committee would conduct an increasingly in-depth analysis of the factors it believed were most relevant to its decision at that stage, including whether reincorporation would affect Tesla&#8217;s market value, whether there were any substantial differences in the bundle of stockholder rights in the jurisdictions under consideration, and whether there were potential benefits to the Company and all of its stockholders from particular jurisdictions. The final stage of this decision process would frame a binary choice between remaining in Delaware and reincorporating in the best alternative jurisdiction. 1. Narrowing The Focus To 10 States. &#8203; The Committee&#8217;s first step was to pick 10 jurisdictions, from the 50 US states and other countries, for greater analysis. The Committee considered first principles: A company&#8217;s state of incorporation is its legal &#8216;home.&#8217; There is intuitive logic for a company to be legally at home where it is physically at home, though there may be affirmative reasons to incorporate in a jurisdiction where the company has no significant physical connection. This factor pointed toward considering jurisdictions in which Tesla has significant physical operations. The Committee next evaluated whether it should further consider any international jurisdictions. It determined that, while foreign incorporation may be the right choice for some companies, it is not for Tesla. Tesla is a proudly American company. The Committee then looked at data regarding the number of public company incorporations in each US state, as states with a significant number of public company incorporations would likely have developed, modern corporate laws. 6 While the majority of US public companies are domiciled in Delaware, 9 other states are the jurisdiction of incorporation of more than 50 public companies: California, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. That includes the 4 states in which Tesla has significant physical operations: California, Nevada, New York, and Texas. So the Committee chose to focus on these 9 states as well as Delaware. 2. Narrowing The Focus To 5 States. &#8203; For the next stage of its work, the Committee focused on identifying any major negative impacts from a potential reincorporation, as well as any major differences in corporate law in any of the states under consideration. The Committee found none. A preliminary evaluation did not identify any likely impact on Tesla&#8217;s market valuation from a reincorporation. The Committee&#8217;s academic expert on corporate law and governance, Professor Casey, surveyed academic research on whether there is a &#8220;Delaware premium,&#8221; i.e., whether companies incorporated in Delaware have higher valuations. His initial view was that the empirical literature suggests such a premium does not exist. 7 Initial analysis by the Committee&#8217;s financial advisor similarly suggested there would likely be no significant impact on valuation because of a company&#8217;s state of incorporation within the US. &#8203; 6 Deal Point Data (as of 2/18/24). 7 Compare Report of Professor Anthony J. Casey to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Tesla, Inc. (&#8220;Casey Report,&#8221; attached as Exhibit&#160;D) &#182;&#182; 42-51; see also, e.g., Rhee, The Irrelevance of Delaware Corporate Law , 48 Journal of Corporation Law 295 (2023) (finding no such premium). &#160; E-8 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; At this stage, the Committee also considered a high-level comparison of stockholder rights and governance matters in each jurisdiction under consideration. The topics were: &#8226; Fiduciary duties. &#8203; &#8226; The business judgment rule. &#8203; &#8226; Interested transactions. &#8203; &#8226; Conflicted controller transactions. &#8203; &#8226; Exculpation. &#8203; &#8226; Indemnification and advancement. &#8203; &#8226; Derivative claims. &#8203; &#8226; Books and records inspection rights. &#8203; &#8226; Ratification of invalid corporate acts. &#8203; &#8226; Stockholder action by written consent. &#8203; &#8226; Special stockholder meetings. &#8203; &#8226; Appointing and removing directors. &#8203; &#8226; Blank-check preferred stock. &#8203; &#8226; Anti-takeover measures. &#8203; After discussion with its counsel, the Committee concluded that the corporate law of each of the 10 US states under consideration is, on the whole, substantially similar. Three potentially relevant differences were noted in particular. First, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas have &#8220;constituency statutes,&#8221; which expressly permit directors and officers to take into account a company&#8217;s mission or broader stakeholder considerations when discharging their fiduciary duties. Second, Nevada was the only state under consideration without a heightened standard of judicial review for interested transactions or that allows exculpation for certain duty of loyalty claims. And third, there was some variation in anti-takeover protections, with Delaware having one of the most management-friendly approaches. The Committee viewed this factor as not especially relevant to Tesla at this time, including because of its market capitalization. After reflecting on these considerations and its guiding principles, the Committee determined that there was no affirmative reason for Tesla to reincorporate in any jurisdiction it has no current connection to. So it determined not to proceed with further analysis of Florida, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Virginia. 3. Narrowing The Choice To 2 States. &#8203; To set up a final binary choice, the Committee focused on identifying which of California, Nevada, New York, or Texas would be the best alternative to Delaware for Tesla. At the request of the Committee and its counsel, Professor Casey conducted a review of the history and evolution of corporate law in the US. Of particular salience to the Committee was the history of competition among states for incorporations. As Professor Casey explained, Delaware became the leading center for incorporations in the US by first adopting New Jersey&#8217;s corporate law &#8220;largely verbatim,&#8221; and then further innovating over time. 8 He highlighted how corporate law within the US has largely converged, with two key drivers being other states copying Delaware&#8217;s innovations, and the creation and nationwide influence of the Model Business Corporations Act (the &#8220;MBCA&#8221;). 9 Professor Casey also addressed the literature analyzing companies&#8217; incorporation decisions. According to academic scholarship, more than 90% of companies are incorporated in either their home state or Delaware, with &#8203; 8 Casey Report &#182;&#182; 36-39. 9 Id. &#182; 41. &#160; E-9 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; approximately 60% in Delaware. 10 Scholars hypothesize a number of factors for this, including: the natural place for a new company to be first incorporated is often its home state; the value of having decisionmakers for corporate governance disputes located in the same community as the company&#8217;s operations; strategic advantages from particular provisions of Delaware law, especially director and officer liability protections; the expertise of the Delaware judiciary; and network effects. These discussions led the Committee to rule out California, Nevada, and New York. Each of these states is important to Tesla. California was Tesla&#8217;s birthplace. It has two factories there: The Fremont factory, which was Tesla&#8217;s first and continues to produce the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y; 11 and the Megafactory Lathrop, which is one of the largest utility-scale battery factories in America. 12 Nevada has the Company&#8217;s first Gigafactory, which is one of the world&#8217;s highest volume plants for electric motors, energy storage products, vehicle powertrains, and batteries, and is the manufacturing hub for the Tesla Semi. 13 And New York also has a Gigafactory, which builds solar panels and electrical components for Superchargers. 14 But none of these states are Tesla&#8217;s current home. That is Texas. [The rest of this page was intentionally left blank.] &#8203; 10 Id. &#182; 25 &amp; fn. 7-8. 11 See tesla.com/fremont-factory. 12 See tesla.com/megafactory. 13 See tesla.com/giga-nevada. 14 See tesla.com/manufacturing. &#160; E-10 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Because Texas is Tesla&#8217;s current physical headquarters, the Committee concluded that it is the single best alternative incorporation jurisdiction. 15 It therefore framed its final choice as: Delaware, Tesla&#8217;s current state of incorporation; or Texas, the Company&#8217;s current home state. B. The First State Or The Lone Star State? &#8203; The final stage of the Committee&#8217;s incorporation decision was an in-depth comparison of remaining incorporated in Delaware or reincorporating in Texas. As explained further below, the Committee concluded first that the rights that Tesla stockholders would possess under Texas law are substantially equivalent to the rights they currently possess under Delaware law. This left three differentiating factors in the Committee&#8217;s view: Texas is Tesla&#8217;s home state; Texas&#8217;s constituency statute would better align with Tesla&#8217;s mission-driven culture; and Delaware has the most respected business court and the largest body of corporate case law in the country, whereas Texas just created a business court. The Committee balanced these considerations and concluded that, in its business judgment, it is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders for the Company to reincorporate in Texas. 1. Delaware And Texas Law Are Substantially Equivalent. &#8203; The Committee and its advisors thoroughly compared Delaware and Texas law. This analysis was framed by the lens that corporate law provides a &#8220;bundle of rights&#8221; for stockholders along three dimensions: &#8220;economic rights, governance rights, and litigation rights.&#8221; 16 The Committee discussed and debated these three aspects of stockholder rights at length with its advisors, including in multi-hour panel discussions with Delaware and Texas practitioners, and with Professor Casey. The Committee instructed its financial advisor, Houlihan, to examine market practices and conduct quantitative analysis, and instructed its academic advisor, Professor Casey, to evaluate relevant academic research, in order to assist it in evaluating any potential economic impact from reincorporating in Texas. And the Committee considered extensive written materials about Delaware and Texas law provided by its advisors. The Committee&#8217;s business judgment is that Delaware and Texas provide substantially equivalent bundles of economic, governance, and litigation rights for stockholders, at least on net and as relevant to Tesla. The Committee&#8217;s legal advisors unanimously supported this judgment and the Committee&#8217;s process in reaching it: Kristen Seeger &#8203; 15 The Committee was also cognizant that Nevada has been described as diverging from other states&#8217; corporate laws with respect to litigation protection for directors and officers. See, e.g., Palkon v. Maffei (&#8220; TripAdvisor &#8221;), 2024 WL 678204 (Del. Ch. 2024) (addressing a proposed reincorporation to Nevada). Professor Casey noted a historical parallel, as Delaware&#8217;s decision in 1986 to provide greater liability protections to directors than other states via exculpation is perhaps the single most compelling cause of its current preeminence as an incorporation home, as shown by the following charts: Casey Report &#182; 39 (citing Sanga, Network Effects in Corporate Governance , Journal of Law &amp; Economics (2020)). Regardless, the Committee concluded that, even if Nevada law provided greater protection from unmeritorious and protracted litigation, any difference did not outweigh the fact that Texas is Tesla&#8217;s home state. 16 See, e.g., TripAdvisor , 2024 WL 678204, at *1, *19. &#160; E-11 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; and John Skakun (Sidley) from an overall perspective; Professor Casey (University of Chicago Law School) from an academic perspective; Tom Bayliss (Abrams &amp; Bayliss) and Gary Gerstman (Sidley) from a Delaware law perspective; and Yolanda Garcia and George Vlahakos (Sidley) from a Texas law perspective. The work of the Committee&#8217;s financial advisor, Houlihan, supported this judgment on the economic aspects. a. Substantially Equivalent Economic Rights. &#8203; No Delaware Premium. &#160;&#160;&#160;A critical question for the Committee was whether there was any reason to believe that Tesla shares would be economically less valuable under Texas law than under Delaware law. If so, that would be a significant&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;likely dispositive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;reason to remain incorporated in Delaware. If not, that would suggest market participants do not view any potential legal differences between Delaware and Texas to be worth paying for. The Committee concluded, based on the advice of its financial and academic advisors, that there was no convincing evidence that reincorporating in Texas would affect Tesla&#8217;s market value. Market Practice. &#160;&#160;&#160;Three points about market practice&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more precisely, the lack thereof&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;were especially compelling to the Committee. First, Houlihan explained that a company&#8217;s US state of incorporation is not a factor in commonly used valuation methodologies. Neither practitioners (including investment banks and appraisers) nor finance textbooks recognize Delaware law as being a factor of value. Certain valuation methodologies do, however, take into account countries through a variable risk premium, showing that certain legal and regulatory regimes as well as other country-specific risk factors are believed to affect economic value. Second, Houlihan reviewed 2,012 stockholder activism campaigns from 2019 to 2023 that advocated for a wide variety of corporate actions to increase stockholder value. None of these campaigns advocated for reincorporation to Delaware, despite 35% of S&amp;P 500 companies and a similar&#160;percentage of Russell 3000 companies being incorporated outside of Delaware. If reincorporating in Delaware would create value, the Committee concluded activists would have identified and arbitraged that. And third, the Houlihan team also indicated during a meeting that, based on conversations with members of their capital markets team, they had not been involved in an offering in which US state of incorporation was a meaningful factor in raising capital. Quantitative Analysis .&#160;&#160;&#160;Houlihan also looked for whether there was evidence of a Delaware premium through three quantitative analyses. First, they evaluated four market-implied valuation multiples from 2019 through 2023 for Fortune 500 companies: enterprise value/revenue; enterprise value/EBITDA; market capitalization/earnings; and market capitalization/book value. They did not find any observable valuation premium attributable to Delaware incorporation. Second, Houlihan also analyzed market return metrics for Fortune 500 companies from 2014 through 2023, and similarly found no observable premium attributable to Delaware incorporation. Finally, Houlihan reviewed four case studies of redomestications from Delaware to Texas over the last decade. They reported no observable pattern between redomestication and total stockholder return over the periods studied. Academic Literature. &#160;&#160;&#160;After his initial survey of academic research on the Delaware premium earlier in the process, Professor Casey conducted a deeper dive and comprehensively analyzed the literature. He concluded that the &#8220;existing literature strongly suggests that such premium is non-existent or unknowable.&#8221; 17 The Committee was also persuaded by Professor Casey&#8217;s point that, &#8220;given the incentives of academics and market actors to prove a definitive answer here and the difficulty of proving a negative, the most reasonable conclusion is that no discoverable premium exists.&#8221; 18 No Other Negative Economic Impacts To Stockholders. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee additionally checked that reincorporation in Texas would not materially alter any other economic rights of stockholders. For example, Texas law would not alter the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or buyback stock. 19 And at the Committee&#8217;s request, the Company confirmed that reincorporating in Texas will not have any materially adverse accounting, tax, or other financial implications, and will not affect the public trading of the Company&#8217;s shares. 20 Reincorporation will &#8203; 17 Casey Report &#182; 127. 18 Id. &#182; 128. 19 See TBOC &#167;&#160;2.101(9); TBOC &#167;&#160;21.310. 20 One possible tax effect is that Texas law requires an apportionment of gross income for transactions involving a repurchase of company debt at a discount. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, &#167;&#160;3.591(e)(6). The Committee determined this was not relevant for Tesla at this time. &#160; E-12 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; result in the Company saving $250,000 per year in franchise tax payments to Delaware, which Houlihan calculated would translate into an implied value accretion of approximately $11&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;14&#160;million. b. Substantially Equivalent Governance Rights. &#8203; The vast majority of governance rules are effectively the same under Texas and Delaware law. For example, both Delaware and Texas have similar rules on classified boards, the removal of directors, charter and bylaw amendments, blank check preferred stock, stock buybacks, dividends, and appraisal. 21 Where there may appear to be distinctions, the Committee concluded that: most were differences in default rules that could be resolved in a Texas charter and bylaws; some made no difference at least to Tesla; and one&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Texas&#8217;s constituency statute&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;did not substantially alter stockholders&#8217; rights but does matter to Tesla. Differences Addressed By The Proposed Charter And Bylaws. &#160;&#160;&#160;There are a number of governance matters where Delaware and Texas law set different default rules but allow changes via the charter or bylaws. One example is the rule for mergers: by default, Delaware requires only a majority vote but allows the charter to raise the threshold; Texas is the opposite, setting a supermajority default rule but allowing the charter to lower the threshold to a majority vote. 22 After the Committee narrowed its focus to Delaware and Texas, it directed the Company to provide it with a draft Texas charter and bylaws that were as similar to the current Delaware versions as legally possible. In the Committee&#8217;s view, the proposed Texas charter and bylaws are functionally equivalent to the current Delaware charter and bylaws from a stockholder governance rights perspective. The one arguable exception the Committee sees would increase stockholder rights. Delaware allows companies to prohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting, and Tesla&#8217;s current charter does that; Texas, in contrast, mandates that stockholders be permitted to call a special meeting under certain circumstances. 23 The proposed Texas charter therefore provides that stockholders can call a special meeting under certain circumstances. 24 Differences That Don&#8217;t Matter To Tesla. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee identified a handful of areas where the rule in Texas differed in some respect from the rule in Delaware. These were generally procedural or not relevant to Tesla in the view of the Committee and its advisors. The most potentially important area related to anti-takeover protections. The Committee took the view that these were not a significant consideration for Tesla in light of its market capitalization. It nonetheless scrutinized the differences between Delaware and Texas on this issue before concluding that, on net, they were not substantially different. Both Delaware and Texas permit a range of anti-takeover defenses, including poison pills. Both have business combination provisions, though they apply at different ownership thresholds: 20% in Texas and 15% in Delaware. 25 Both allow boards to create new vacancies and to fill them, though Texas limits the number of such vacancies that can be filled without a stockholder vote to 2. 26 Another potential area of difference involved cash-out transactions and &#8220; Revlon &#160;&#160;&#160;duties&#8221;: Texas statutes allow directors to take into account &#8220;the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation and the stockholders of the corporation, including the possibility that those interests &#8203; 21 Compare, e.g., DGCL &#167;&#160;141(d) and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.408(a); DGCL &#167;&#160;141(k) and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.409; DGCL &#167;&#160;242(a) and TBOC &#167;&#167;&#160;21.054-55; DGCL &#167;&#160;109(a) and TBOC &#167;&#167;&#160;21.057-58; DGCL &#167;&#160;151(a) and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.155(a); DGCL &#167;&#167;&#160;154, 170(a) and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.310; DGCL &#167;&#160;262 and TBOC &#167;&#160;10.354(a)(2); see also Casey Report &#182; 135. 22 Compare DGCL &#167;&#167;&#160;251, 102(b)(4) and TBOC &#167;&#167;&#160;21.457(a), 21.365(a). 23 Compare DGCL &#167;&#160;211 and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.352(a)(1)-(2). 24 The proposed Texas bylaws, like the current Delaware ones, also contain a forum selection provision. The Texas forum selection provision, however, selects the Texas business courts as the primary venue rather than the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Committee concluded that this did not substantially alter stockholders&#8217; governance rights. Compare TripAdvisor , 2024 WL 678204, at *13. The Committee did weigh litigation forum in its final calculus, as described below. 25 Compare DGCL &#167;&#160;203(c)(5) and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.607(2). 26 Compare DGCL &#167;&#160;223(a) and TBOC &#167;&#160;21.410(d). &#160; E-13 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation.&#8221; 27 Delaware law, at least in certain circumstances, requires directors to accept the highest price reasonably available, though in many circumstances they are allowed to also &#8220;just say no&#8221; to a potential transaction and take into account long-term interests. 28 Ultimately, the Committee concluded that these distinctions, to the extent they may bear out in the real world, related to edge cases that were unlikely to be relevant to Tesla given its market capitalization. Texas&#8217;s Constituency Statute. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee identified one governance feature that, in its view, does meaningfully distinguish Texas law from Delaware law: Texas is one of more than 30 states with a constituency statute, codified at TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401. 29 This statute expressly allows directors and officers of a Texas corporation to consider, among other things, a positive impact on the environment when making decisions about the company&#8217;s business. Delaware does not have a constituency statute, though in practice it is generally acknowledged that similar considerations can often be taken into account. 30 The Committee and its advisors concluded that Texas&#8217;s constituency statute does not, on net and in practice, lessen the bundle of stockholder rights in Texas. But the Committee did weigh Texas&#8217;s constituency statute in reaching its final decision, as discussed further below. c. Substantially Equivalent Litigation Rights. &#8203; The Committee and its advisors engaged deeply with a wide range of litigation topics. They identified no areas in which Texas and Delaware law meaningfully diverged on matters of substance. In most areas, both states apply the same substantive decision rule. In some areas that have been addressed by Delaware, Texas is silent but would, in the judgment of the Committee and its advisors, likely follow Delaware. And in a few areas where Texas law has made different choices, they are procedural in nature and do not cause stockholders to possess substantially lesser litigation rights than under Delaware law. Litigation rights are first class-rights in Texas. 31 The Same Rule. &#160;&#160;&#160;In most areas the Committee examined, Texas and Delaware law apply essentially the same substantive rule, though Texas sometimes articulates it a bit differently. These include fiduciary duties owed to the corporation and the stockholders collectively, the corporate opportunities doctrine, director exculpation, indemnification, advancement, the business judgment rule, and the entire fairness standard of judicial review. 32 Texas&#8217;s fiduciary duty of obedience exemplifies this: Obedience is an express third fiduciary duty under Texas law, in addition to loyalty and care, and requires fiduciaries to not commit ultra vires acts. 33 Delaware law does not describe directors as owing a &#8220;duty of obedience,&#8221; but similarly prohibits ultra vires acts. 34 So there is no functional difference. Silences In Texas Law. &#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware law has addressed a number of issues impacting public companies that Texas law has not (yet), including Caremark &#160;&#160;&#160;oversight claims, public company conflicted controller transactions, and intermediate scrutiny of defensive tactics. However, Texas&#8217;s silence in these areas does not mean that Texas law is or will be meaningfully different from Delaware law. Texas courts have a long history and clearly stated position of looking to Delaware law to fill gaps in Texas law. 35 &#8203; 27 TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401(b), (d). 28 Casey Report &#182;&#182; 101-02. 29 Id. &#182; 94. 30 See Business Roundtable, 8/19/19 Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, tinyurl.com/d9susybt. Delaware does, like Texas, have benefit corporation statutes. 31 TripAdvisor , 2024 WL 678204, at *20. 32 Casey Report &#182;&#182; 86-93. 33 Id. &#182; 89; see also Gearhart Indus., Inc. v. Smith Inter., Inc. , 741 F.2d 707, 719 (5th Cir. 1984). 34 Casey Report &#182; 89. 35 E.g., In re DeMattia , 644 S.W.3d 225, 230 (Tex. App. 2022) (Texas courts &#8220;look to Delaware on matters of corporate law&#8221;); Hanmi Fin. Corp. v. SWNB Bancorp, Inc. , 2019 WL 937195, at *7 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 26, 2019) (&#8220;Texas courts consider Delaware decisional law persuasive in resolving unsettled issues of Texas corporate law&#8221;; &#8220;Texas courts would adopt Delaware fiduciary law in the merger context&#8221;). &#160; E-14 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Caremark claims illustrate the point. Federal courts applying Texas law have predicted that &#8220;the Texas Supreme Court would look to Delaware&#8221; and would apply the Caremark framework. 36 And even though conflicted controller transactions and intermediate scrutiny have not been directly addressed by Texas courts in the public company context, Texas&#8217;s application of fairness review to interested director transactions conceptually maps onto those circumstances. At the end of the day, the Committee and its advisors concluded that there was no reason to believe that Texas law would provide substantially lesser litigation rights in areas where it is currently silent. Procedural Differences. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee and its advisors identified two important areas with differences between Texas and Delaware stockholder litigation. The Committee and its Delaware, Texas, and academic advisors concluded that these differences were procedural. First , Texas and Delaware differ in their procedural approach to stockholder derivative claims. Texas follows the MBCA and is one of nearly two-dozen &#8220;universal demand&#8221; jurisdictions, meaning that derivative plaintiffs must make a demand on the board and the board must be given an opportunity to investigate the claims before litigation is filed. 37 Delaware, in contrast, allows stockholders to make a demand on the board or to file litigation without making a demand based on an allegation that demand would be futile. 38 Both states provide avenues for stockholders to get documents to support potential derivative claims before initiating a derivative claim. 39 The Committee and its advisors believe that Texas&#8217;s choice to adopt the MBCA&#8217;s universal demand regime does not mean that Tesla&#8217;s stockholders would have lesser derivative litigation rights under Texas law than under Delaware law. Texas picked a different, but not inferior, procedural path for the vindication of the same underlying substantive rights. Second , Texas recently created a specialized business court system, which is set to open on September&#160;1, 2024. 40 These new courts will handle public company corporate governance matters, as well as commercial disputes over $10&#160;million (with some exceptions), and judges will be appointed to renewable 2 year terms. 41 Cases will be subject to trial by jury&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which may be more favorable for stockholder plaintiffs. 42 The Committee concluded that this difference from the Delaware court system relates only to the forum for corporate disputes, not the substantive law, and therefore does not render Texas litigation rights substantially lesser than Delaware litigation rights. 43 The Committee considered these differences further in its reaching its final decision, as laid out below. Other Commentary. &#160;&#160;&#160;A final factor that the Committee examined was commentary comparing Delaware and Texas law. In response to the Committee&#8217;s inquiry during a meeting, Professor Casey confirmed his view that the academic literature does not identify substantial differences between Texas and Delaware law. Additionally, recent reincorporations to Texas do not identify substantial differences between Texas and Delaware law. Of the last four public company reincorporations from Delaware to Texas, none pointed to greater litigation protections in Texas. 44 And the proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have generally recommended for recent Texas reincorporations, without identifying any substantial differences between their laws. For example, ISS has stated &#8203; 36 In re Life Partners Holdings, Inc ., 2015 WL 8523103, at *10 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 9, 2015) (citing Texas state case law for the proposition that in Texas &#8220;there is a presumption favoring Delaware law such that a party who opposes its application bears the burden to show Delaware law&#8217;s inconsistency &#160;&#160;&#160;with Texas law.&#8221;) (emphasis in original). 37 TBOC &#167;&#167;&#160;21.551-63. 38 Casey Report &#182; 108; see also Grimes v.

Why Reincorporate In Texas? &#8203; In the final calculus, the Committee weighed three considerations. First, Tesla&#8217;s physical headquarters is in Texas. Second, Tesla is a mission-driven company. And third, the Delaware corporate courts are well-known whereas the Texas business courts have not started hearing cases yet. On balance, the Committee concluded that, for Tesla at this time, these considerations weighed in favor of reincorporating in Texas. a. Tesla&#8217;s Home And Future Is In Texas. &#8203; The primary driver of the Committee&#8217;s decision was that Texas is Tesla&#8217;s home state. Tesla Is All-In On Texas. &#160;&#160;&#160;Tesla moved its global headquarters to Austin in 2021. Since then, Texas has increasingly become a focal point for Tesla&#8217;s corporate identity. Executive management is based in Texas, as are a significant number of manufacturing, operations, and engineering employees. The Austin Gigafactory&#160;&#8212; &#8220;Giga Texas&#8221;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;began production in 2021, and is already Tesla&#8217;s principal manufacturing facility. With 10&#160;million square feet of factory floor, Giga Texas is thought to be the second largest building in the world by volume, and the largest in the US by floor area. 47 It is the manufacturing hub for the Model&#160;Y, the best-selling car in the world, and the home of the Cybertruck and Tesla&#8217;s future vehicles. 48 Texas is also central to Tesla&#8217;s future growth, as the Committee&#8217;s interviews with directors and management confirmed. A major expansion of Giga Texas is already under construction, and may make it the largest building in the world by volume and put it in the top 5 in the world by floor area. Employment in Texas is also expected to grow as Giga Texas is expanded and production ramps. This growth is rooted in the strategic advantages of Texas, including its business climate, its diverse and skilled workforce, its strong economic and demographic growth, and the availability and cost of key resources. Reincorporating in Texas builds on Tesla&#8217;s relationships with the state and the local community. These relationships&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;with government actors, with employees, and with other stakeholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are critical to Tesla. The academic literature recognizes that &#8220;there is value inherent in home-state incorporation&#8221; because it can strengthen such relationships. 49 Fully becoming a Texas company would send a strong signal of Tesla&#8217;s commitment to the state and community that have done so much for it already, and that are so important to Tesla&#8217;s future. There Is Value In Local Decisionmaking. &#160;&#160;&#160;Another advantage of home-state incorporation is that the legislators and judges making corporate law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the juries deciding fact disputes in corporate cases&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are drawn from the community in which the company operates. 50 Corporate law and litigation often overlap with and impact business, employment, and operational matters. And Tesla is not a cookie-cutter public company. Local decisionmakers will, in the Committee&#8217;s view, have a deeper understanding of Tesla and its business, and therefore be best situated to make decisions about its corporate governance. &#8203; 45 Legacy Housing Corp. 2019 ISS Report at 18; see also Geospace Technologies Corp. 2015 ISS Report at 19 (shareholder rights &#8220;would not be materially weakened by changes to applicable state takeover statutes&#8221;). 46 Legacy Housing Corp. 2019 Glass Lewis Report at 8 (recommending against this reincorporation proposal because of a charter amendment, not differences in state law); compare DSS, Inc. 2020 ISS Report at 15 &amp; DSS, Inc. 2020 Glass Lewis Report at 10 (both recommending in favor of reincorporation from New York to Texas because of the &#8220;neutral impact on shareholders&#8217; rights&#8221; and because &#8220;shareholders will not see many meaningful differences between New York corporate governance and that of a Company incorporated in Texas&#8221;). 47 See, e.g., en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_buildings. 48 See tesla.com/giga-texas; 2023 10-K at 30, 34. 49 Casey Report &#182;&#182; 56-57, 132. 50 Id. &#182;&#182; 59-60 (also noting that the value of judicial decisions being made in the community where their effects are centered is a long-standing venue consideration for many other areas of law). &#160; E-16 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Home State Incorporation Is Common And Intuitively Makes Sense. &#160;&#160;&#160;Many major public companies are incorporated in their home state, including household names like Abbott, Aflac, American Express, Anthem, Apple, Best Buy, Cisco, Comcast, Costco, Dollar General, Eli Lilly, IBM, Lowe&#8217;s, Footlocker, Goodyear, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kroger, Lockheed Martin, Merck, Microsoft, Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Progressive, Prudential, S&amp;P Global, Southwest, Starbucks, and Target. The following map illustrates the geographic diversity of such companies: Many of these companies were founded in their home state and never decided there was justification for separating their legal home from their physical home. But public companies also have reincorporated from Delaware to their home state in order to reunite their legal and physical homes. The example of Microsoft was instructive for the Committee. One of the reasons given by Microsoft when it left Delaware was that Washington was &#8220;the location of the Company&#8217;s world headquarters and the location of its primary research and development efforts.&#8221; 51 Other companies that have recently reincorporated in Texas have pointed to the same reason. 52 Home state incorporation fits the Company&#8217;s first principles approach. The Committee found no advantage to remaining incorporated in Delaware that justified a split between Tesla&#8217;s legal home and its physical home. b. Tesla Is A Mission-Driven Company. &#8203; A secondary factor that favored Texas in the Committee&#8217;s view was Texas&#8217;s constituency statute. Tesla is an exceptionally mission-driven company. Its website proclaims: &#8220;Our mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy.&#8221; 53 The Company&#8217;s 2023 annual report says the same thing in its second paragraph, and later declares: &#8220;The very purpose of Tesla&#8217;s existence is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy.&#8221; 54 There have been 3 &#8220;Master Plans&#8221; about Tesla&#8217;s mission, including last year&#8217;s 41-page &#8220;Master Plan&#160;3: Sustainable Energy for All of Earth.&#8221; 55 The mission is a cornerstone of Tesla&#8217;s culture. It is critical to recruitment, motivation, and retention from the factory floor to the boardroom. Indeed, the mission&#8217;s importance was emphasized by every director interviewed by the Committee. For several, including Wilson-Thompson, the mission is a major reason they choose to serve on the Board. &#8203; 51 Microsoft Corporation 1993 Proxy Statement at 12 (also stating that Washington had &#8220;updated&#8221; its corporation law since Microsoft left Washington for Delaware in 1986 in order to take advantage of the litigation protections offered by Delaware&#8217;s then-new director exculpation statute). 52 See, e.g., Legacy Housing Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement at 11; Contango Oil &amp; Gas Co. 2019 Proxy Statement at 32; DallasNews Corp. 2018 Proxy Statement at 21; Geospace Technologies Corp. 2015 Proxy Statement at 30-31. 53 See tesla.com/impact; see also tesla.com/ns_videos/2022-tesla-impact-report.pdf. 54 2023 10-K at 4, 12. 55 See tesla.com/ns_videos/Tesla-Master-Plan-Part-3.pdf; tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux; tesla.com/blog/ &#8203; secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me. &#160; E-17 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Texas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;unlike Delaware&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;has an express statutory provision that would allow (though not require) Tesla&#8217;s directors and officers to consider the Company&#8217;s mission in exercising their fiduciary duties. 56 As a practical matter, the Committee does not expect this would change the way Tesla operates; Delaware law did not, of course, prevent Tesla from being a mission-driven company. 57 But there is value in symbolism, particularly for corporate culture. It is the Committee&#8217;s business judgment that Texas law on this point better aligns with Tesla&#8217;s mission, and with Tesla as a mission-driven company. 58 c. Litigation Forum Considerations Do Not Alter The Balance. &#8203; The Committee also considered the likely relative predictability of Delaware and Texas law based on differences in their judicial systems. The Delaware Court of Chancery and Supreme Court are the most respected and experienced business courts in the country. They have an extensive body of case law. Trials are before judges who are experts in corporate law and appointed for 12 year terms. Delaware statutory law is regularly updated by the legislature. The Delaware system has long and widely been lauded for its expertise. On the other side of the ledger, Texas&#8217;s business courts were just created and will not start hearing cases until September&#160;2024. They will have less existing corporate case law to draw on. Business court judges will be appointed for 2 year terms, but there is no track record of their qualifications or experience. 59 Plus, dispositive motion practice is more limited in Texas, and even corporate governance cases will be tried to juries rather than judges. 60 How the Texas business court system will function cannot be known for certain. The Committee questioned its advisors extensively on how to weigh the differences between these judicial systems. It held a multi-hour panel discussion with its Delaware counsel Bayliss and its Texas litigation counsel Garcia, moderated by Professor Casey, and had separate follow-up sessions with each of Bayliss and Garcia. All made powerful points. The Committee had meaningful concerns about potential uncertainty in Texas because the new business courts have not started hearing cases and because of the possibility of jury trials. These concerns were eventually mitigated. Texas expressly draws on Delaware case law, which alleviates some uncertainty. And as Professor Casey pointed out, Texas &#8220;has a more code-based corporate governance regime,&#8221; and so does not depend on cases to set out the law as much as Delaware. 61 Further, while the Texas business courts are new, Texas and its legal system more generally are not unknown to Tesla. Tesla has significant experience litigating in Texas. And while the prospect of jury trials for corporate governance matters gave the Committee pause, jurors would be drawn from the community in which Tesla operates, and juries decide only questions of fact based on instruction from a judge regarding the law. Garcia also noted that jury trials on public company corporate governance matters are rare in her decades of experience. 62 The Committee was also persuaded by Professor Casey&#8217;s conclusion that an academic &#8220;consensus has emerged that Delaware corporate law is largely indeterminate and often unpredictable,&#8221; &#8220;because the law is applied largely through case-specific standards that rely on the ex post judgment of the judges.&#8221; 63 This indeterminacy is often pointed to as a virtue of Delaware law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it provides flexibility and allows Delaware judges to &#8220;reach [&#8199;&#8199;] the &#8216;right&#8217; &#8203; 56 TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401. 57 Compare Business Roundtable, 8/19/19 Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, tinyurl.com/d9susybt. 58 Texas law also allows for &#8220;social purposes&#8221; like Tesla&#8217;s mission to be incorporated into companies&#8217; charters. TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401(c), (d). As explained above, the proposed Texas charter is as similar to the current Delaware version as legally possible. If Tesla reincorporates in Texas, the Committee understands that the Board will consider amending its charter at a later time to incorporate the mission. 59 Tex.

The Committee observed sessions from the 36th Annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute, 68 which was held on March&#160;7 and 8, 2024. As publicly reported, comments at the conference included: &#8226; &#8220;It is an unsettled time. It&#8217;s more difficult to counsel people.&#8221; Leo Strine, former Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court. &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;Some of the predictability across the board is not there.&#8221; Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP. 69 &#8203; The Committee&#8217;s takeaway was that comparing the certainty and predictability of these jurisdictions was not straightforward. There are, as Professor Casey concluded, differences that &#8220;point in both directions.&#8221; 70 The Committee was also cognizant that Tesla will face litigation wherever it is incorporated. It is a large and innovative company, and so will be an attractive target for lawsuits and will consistently face litigation uncertainty. In the Committee&#8217;s business judgment, differences between the Delaware and Texas judicial systems do not outweigh the value of being incorporated in Tesla&#8217;s home state of Texas, and the Texas constituency statute&#8217;s better alignment with Tesla&#8217;s mission. * * * In the Committee&#8217;s business judgment, it is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders for Tesla to reincorporate in Texas. The Committee therefore recommended that: (1)&#160;the Board and management take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Committee&#8217;s determination consistent with legal obligations; (2)&#160;Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk be recused from the Board&#8217;s deliberations and from the vote on this matter, because of Elon Musk&#8217;s prior posts on X about reincorporation; (3)&#160;the stockholder vote on reincorporation be conditioned on approval by at least a majority of votes cast by non-Musk-affiliated stockholders, for the same reason; and (4)&#160;the Board recommend that stockholders vote for reincorporation based on the Committee&#8217;s determination that reincorporating in Texas is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders. The Committee left to the Company how to best effectuate reincorporation. It understands that the Company is prepared to reincorporate in Texas via a conversion under &#167;&#160;266 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, if stockholders approve the reincorporation.

The Committee&#8217;s Ratification Decision. &#8203; A. The Committee&#8217;s Evaluation Of Ratification. &#8203; The Committee considered a discrete question on ratification: should Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan be put to a new stockholder vote at the same time as the vote on reincorporation, with a recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of ratification? For this question, too, the Committee identified certain key principles to guide its work: The views of Tesla&#8217;s stockholders are important. Motivating Musk to devote his time and energy to Tesla is important. The Committee would consult with and rely on any and all independent advisors it deemed necessary. It would take the time needed to thoroughly evaluate relevant considerations. It would assess what is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders at this time. The Committee did not renegotiate the amount or terms of Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan. That would not have been, in the Committee&#8217;s view, ratification; that would have functionally been a new compensation process and a new compensation plan, to be judged on their own substantive merits. The Committee also did not evaluate whether the amount or terms of Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan were fair, or opine on the Tornetta ruling about its fairness. The Board previously decided in January&#160;2018 that the compensation plan was fair, and Wilson-Thompson was not on the Board at that time. Moreover, the defendants will be appealing the Tornetta ruling because they believe the compensation plan is fair and should be upheld as agreed. The Committee assessed only whether this 2018 compensation plan , as it was previously agreed to, should be ratified at this time , based on the facts that currently exist. The Committee took account of and investigated a number of factors, including the following. First, Wilson-Thompson is on the Board&#8217;s Compensation Committee, so she already knew the Company&#8217;s compensation practices and philosophy, and how those are strategically tailored to Tesla&#8217;s unique business and governance. She also was aware prior to her appointment to the Special Committee that the Tornetta ruling had had an effect on Musk. Second, the Committee explored stockholder sentiment, including interviewing the Board Chair and head of Investor Relations regarding their interactions with investors. The Committee requested and received from the Company correspondence from investors sent after the Tornetta ruling, including letters and emails to the Tornetta court. The Committee considered conducting its own process to hear from institutional stockholders, but determined this was not necessary in light of the amount and strength of feedback stockholders had already provided. Third, the Committee investigated potential alternatives to ratification, including the possibility that the Company would need to negotiate a replacement compensation package for Musk. The Committee requested and received information from the Company regarding the potential tax and accounting implications of any new compensation package, including in interviews of management and their advisors. Finally, the Committee interviewed Musk about the 2018 compensation plan. Out of an abundance of caution, that interview was held after the Committee initially reached its decision on ratification, during the period this portion of the Report was being drafted. B. Should Stockholders Vote On Musk&#8217;s Compensation? &#8203; The Committee&#8217;s decision on ratification was grounded in several factors. Stockholders Want To Speak For Themselves. &#160;&#160;&#160;Tesla stockholders&#8217; views about their Company are important. Their views on Musk&#8217;s compensation, motivation, and retention are especially important because&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as the Company&#8217;s public disclosures have said for&#160;years&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Tesla is &#8220;highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk.&#8221; 71 As a result, the Company&#8217;s relationship with Musk is a key focus of the Board&#8217;s stockholder engagement program. Since the Tornetta ruling, stockholders have strongly expressed support for Musk&#8217;s compensation. Dozens of institutional stockholders have, unprompted, told the Company&#8217;s Investor Relations team that they disagree with Tornetta &#8217;s invalidation of the 2018 compensation plan. Seven institutional stockholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including 4 of the top 10&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;felt strongly enough to seek a meeting with the Board Chair and raise the issue. One of those top 10 investors, T. Rowe Price, sent a follow up letter to the Board Chair reiterating its support for a new stockholder vote: &#8203; 71 2023 10-K at 21. &#160; E-20 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; We have read the Chancery Court opinion. We would not have taken the plaintiff&#8217;s side in this case, and we found the ruling to be a negative surprise. The bulk of the shares owned by T. Rowe Price at that time voted FOR 72 the program in 2018. With the benefit of hindsight, we don&#8217;t think there can be any serious argument over whether the award was aligned with investors&#8217; long-term interests. The question, of course, is what to do about this if the company&#8217;s appeal is unsuccessful. To be clear, we will be open to considering whatever solutions the board puts forward. However, as we have thought about the problem, the approach we&#8217;d suggest is to fully separate the challenges of (a)&#160;the need to make Mr.&#160;Musk whole for delivering against the required value creation milestones laid out in the 2018 plan without ultimately receiving the promised award, and (b)&#160;the issue of designing a new forward-looking pay program for him. With regard to the 2018 proposition, we do not think it&#8217;s fair to set out a new set of options subject to a fresh set of performance hurdles. The requirements of the 2018 package were extraordinarily ambitious&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; and they were delivered . It is not reasonable for investors to expect to re-absorb the canceled options and consider all that value creation to have been delivered to us for no consideration. Therefore, if it is legally advisable, we suggest simply subjecting the original 2018 package to a new shareholder vote, accompanied by expansive disclosure as to the process undertaken and the potential conflicts of interest that were considered at the time. Now that your analysis can include a retrospective component, we believe that including a discussion of the economic outcome for shareholders and how it was split with the CEO should prove especially persuasive. 73 The issue has also galvanized retail stockholders. More than 6,000 individuals claiming to be stockholders owning more than 23&#160;million total shares&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;equivalent to the 11th largest institutional stockholder&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sent unsolicited letters and emails to the Board or to the Tornetta court supporting Musk&#8217;s compensation. Those letters say things like: &#8226; &#8220;As Tesla shareholders, we want our shareholder votes to count (not be rescinded&#160;years later); we want Tesla CEO Elon Musk to be compensated for his Past Work (that is keep ALL stock options previously awarded for meeting the 2018 Musk Incentive Comp Plan milestones). . . . [We] [w]ould like the Board to explore options to affirm the shareholder vote in support of keeping [&#8199;&#8199;] Tesla&#8217;s 2018 CEO Compensation Plan active and in place.&#8221; 74 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;Shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favour of the CEO&#8217;s compensation package in 2018. I subsequently bought stock with full awareness and understanding of the implications and nature of Elon&#8217;s compensation structure. Contrary to the assumption of ignorance or misinformation, my investment was made after careful consideration and analysis of the proposed incentives and their alignment with the company&#8217;s long-term goals, as well as my own aspirations for gains.&#8221; 75 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;The reinstatement of a similar compensation package is supported by hundreds of TSLA shareholders.&#8221; 76 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;As admirers of the Tesla mission and Mr Musk[&#8216;]s amazing efforts to achieve these goals we would like to repeat our support for the compensation package . . . . We certainly hope that somehow the compensation plan can be kept in place as the majority of the share[&#8199;&#8199;]holders voted for so many&#160;years ago.&#8221; 77 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;As a shareholder who has placed his trust and resources in Tesla, I implore [the court] to consider the broader implications of these legal proceedings. The outcomes extend far beyond the courtroom, shaping the future trajectory of Tesla and the livelihoods of shareholders like myself who believe in its mission. . . . &#8203; &#8203; 72 A footnote to the letter states: &#8220;Of the 11,054,739 shares held by T. Rowe Price on the record date, we voted 11,050,239 shares FOR the grant and 4,500 shares AGAINST the grant.&#8221; 73 4/10/24 Letter to Board Chair Robyn Denholm from T. Rowe Price (emphasis in original). 74 2/5/24 Letter to the Board of Directors from Amy Steffens and Alexandra Merz on behalf of 5,821 stockholders holding 23,337,127 shares (with 196-page spreadsheet identifying those stockholders). 75 Undated Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Mike Henke. 76 Undated Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Alexandru Hetcau. 77 3/11/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Renatus Remmerswaal and family. &#160; E-21 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Any actions that undermine this [compensation] agreement threaten to erode not only shareholder value but also the core values upon which Tesla was built.&#8221; 78 &#8226; &#8220;My choice for Tesla being my primary investment is because of the pay package selected for Elon Musk. No different tha[n] many sales personnel, when you perform, you are awarded, sometimes very handsomely for it. To the opposite of this, many CEO&#8217;s are awarded great sums even when the company i[n] many cases, drastically fails to perform for its shareholders which is why I looked at them&#160;years ago and didn&#8217;t choose them.&#8221; 79 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;[A] majority of my retirement is in Tesla because I believe in the mission, and the great opportunity the investment represents for me and my family. I trust Elon and the board as they have accomplished what everyone claimed was impossible. I supported the compensation plan regardless of who was on the board.&#8221; 80 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;I and millions of other Tesla shareholders have voted with our hard earned money to support this cause. So, we vote again, through this letter, for [the court] to reconsider the impact of this judgement and the harm it will cause Tesla employees, shareholders, our leaders and the future of our planet.&#8221; 81 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;I hold a significant number of shares and am a proud supporter of Tesla&#8217;s mission and vision. Given these facts, I express my support for Elon Musk and Tesla&#8217;s board. Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2018, should be upheld and [] the option awards should stand. I, along with many other retail shareholders, would vote in favor of this compensation plan once again.&#8221; 82 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;In 2018, when the compensation package was devised, Tesla was still in its nascent stage, and the path ahead was fraught with uncertainties. It was a pivotal moment for the company, and the compensation package for Mr.&#160;Musk reflected the significant risks involved. The package was structured in such a way that it aligned Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s incentives with the long-term success of Tesla, thereby safeguarding the interests of shareholders like myself. . . . As an investor, I understood the risks involved in supporting this compensation package. However, I firmly believed in the vision and potential of Tesla under Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s leadership. It was a calculated risk undertaken with the expectation of substantial returns once the company achieved its goals. In conclusion, I respectfully request the court&#8217;s understanding and reconsideration of the 2018 compensation package for Elon Musk at Tesla.&#8221; 83 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;As a small retail investor with a majority of m[&#8199;&#8199;]y investment position in Tesla stock . . . I expect and support that Elon Musk&#8217;s pay package will be reinstated by shareholder vote, in whole or in substantial part, with compliant disclosures.&#8221; 84 &#8203; And that does not count the many posts on X backing Musk&#8217;s compensation. The Committee found this stockholder feedback powerful and persuasive. In its judgment, this alone justifies holding a ratification vote so that stockholders can determine whether Musk&#8217;s compensation plan is fair and in their best interests. A Ratification Vote Cures Tornetta&#8217;s Disclosure Criticisms. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Tornetta decision criticizes many aspects of the negotiation process for, the substance of, and the disclosures about the 2018 compensation plan. A new stockholder vote allows the disclosure deficiencies found by the Tornetta court to be corrected, among other things. Stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan with full knowledge of everything the Tornetta decision criticized. They will also know what Musk achieved. The Committee is aware that the Company and the defendants in Tornetta vigorously dispute the ruling and the defendants plan to appeal it. Regardless of the decision&#8217;s merits, holding a new vote, with the Tornetta opinion &#8203; 78 3/7/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Rafael De La Rosa Troyano. 79 3/5/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Russell McClelland. 80 3/8/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Laurent Molteni. 81 Undated Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Dan &amp; Julie Manfre. 82 3/6/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Andres Jatombliansky. 83 3/10/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Ernest Tam. 84 3/4/24 Letter to the Delaware Court of Chancery from Andre Yoshida. &#160; E-22 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; fully disclosed and attached to the proxy statement, has independent value in the Committee&#8217;s eyes because it will remove the cloud over the 2018 vote. The stockholders can decide for themselves if they think Musk&#8217;s compensation is fair, in light of what he achieved and its impact on stockholders. Ratification Could Avoid Further Uncertainty Regarding Musk&#8217;s Compensation And Motivation. &#160;&#160;&#160;The 2018 compensation plan was first approved by stockholders in March&#160;2018. The Tornetta litigation has been pending for nearly 6&#160;years, and proceedings remain ongoing in the trial court. The appeal, once it is filed, will likely take many&#160;months. Ratification by stockholders at the 2024 annual meeting could avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty regarding the Company&#8217;s most important employee. Although the Committee made its decision beforehand, it wanted to hear directly from Musk on this issue. It asked him whether, and why, the 2018 compensation plan was important to him. Musk told the Committee that, like most people, he wants to be treated fairly and with respect. He said he feels that he worked extraordinarily hard, and made many sacrifices, to meet the terms of the deal that had been agreed on. He made clear that his ownership interest in Tesla is also very meaningful to him. And he confirmed that the 2018 compensation plan had been motivating, and that ratification of it would motivate him to continue devoting his time and energy to Tesla. 85 Seeking Ratification Now Potentially Avoids A Criticism Of The Reincorporation Vote. &#160;&#160;&#160;Holding a ratification vote on Musk&#8217;s compensation now may take away one potential criticism of the stockholder vote on reincorporation. The Committee was cognizant of the possibility that its reincorporation decision could be wrongly perceived as being made in direct response to the Tornetta ruling and with the intent to award Musk compensation in a different jurisdiction that he could not get in Delaware. Holding a ratification vote now should preclude such criticism. 86 Seeking Ratification Now Potentially Avoids Other Costs. &#160;&#160;&#160;If the 2018 compensation plan is not ratified, then Tesla may need to negotiate a replacement compensation plan with Musk in order to motivate him to devote his time and energy to Tesla. Negotiating a new plan would likely take substantial time in light of the criticisms in Tornetta of the process that led to the 2018 compensation plan. And any new plan would, of course, require Musk to agree to the terms and amount. Although the Committee expressly and consciously did not negotiate (or renegotiate) with Musk about his compensation, it expects from its interview with him that, for Musk to agree to it, any new plan would need to be of a similar magnitude to the 2018 plan. There is a risk that a new compensation plan would thus have a substantially similar dilution effect as the 2018 plan (assuming it is equity-based rather than cash). It would likely also result in a very large, incremental accounting charge for compensation expense. For illustrative purposes, the Company&#8217;s Accounting team informed the Committee that a new grant of 300&#160;million fully vested options&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;functionally equivalent to what Musk had before the Tornetta ruling&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;would potentially result in an accounting charge in excess of $25&#160;billion, depending on certain timing and valuation factors. According to their analysis, any replacement compensation plan would likely have to be less than 10% of the size of the 2018 plan to avoid a new accounting charge for compensation expense that is greater than the reversal of the 2018 charge. The Committee also considered the possibility that ratification of Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan could undermine the Tornetta plaintiff&#8217;s request for an award of legal fees of approximately $5&#160;billion in Tesla stock. Many stockholders sent correspondence objecting to this fee request. * * * In the Committee&#8217;s business judgment, it is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders for Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan to be put to a new stockholder vote at the same time as the vote on reincorporation, with a recommendation that stockholders vote in favor of ratification. The Committee therefore recommended to the Board that: (1)&#160;the Board and management take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Committee&#8217;s ratification decision consistent with legal obligations; (2)&#160;Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk be recused from the Board&#8217;s deliberations and from the vote on this matter, because it concerns Elon Musk&#8217;s compensation; (3)&#160;the stockholder &#8203; 85 Of course, even a favorable ratification vote by stockholders may not fully resolve this matter. The Committee and its advisors cannot predict with certainty how a vote to ratify Musk&#8217;s compensation would be treated under Delaware law in these novel circumstances. 86 Compare TripAdvisor , 2024 WL 678204, at *1-2, *5; Palkon v.

The Committee left to the Company how to best effectuate its decision. It understands that the Company is prepared to seek ratification under Delaware common and statutory law, including under &#167;&#160;204 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. [The rest of this page was intentionally left blank.] &#160; E-24 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Part&#160;2: The Special Committee&#8217;s Process I. The Committee&#8217;s Mandate And Composition. &#8203; Whether Tesla should reincorporate has been periodically considered by members of management and outside directors over the past several&#160;years, since Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas in 2021. The question came up again after the Delaware Court of Chancery invalidated Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan on January&#160;30, 2024. The next day, Musk posted on X that &#8220;Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.&#8221; The Board created the Special Committee in part because of this post. Whether to reincorporate outside of Delaware, and whether to put that question to stockholders, is a decision for the Board to make, not Musk alone. The Board convened two special meetings that addressed Musk&#8217;s post about reincorporation. On Sunday, February&#160;4, the Board, including Musk, met and discussed the matter. The Board addressed the public narrative that Musk had already decided the issue for the Company and that Musk&#8217;s post was a reflexive reaction to the Tornetta decision. The discussion reflected the fact that outside directors as well as management had previously explored the possibility of reincorporating (though without coming to a decision one way or the other). At this meeting, the Board determined that, regardless of Musk&#8217;s post, the Board would only consider reincorporating at this time after an appropriate process and timeline, and based on an evaluation of the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. 87 On Saturday, February&#160;10, the Board reconvened to address the reincorporation issue without Elon or Kimbal Musk. Five directors were present: Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, JB Straubel, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. These directors concluded that a majority of the Board was independent and disinterested with respect to reincorporation. They nevertheless decided to create a Special Committee to consider the reincorporation issue out of an abundance of caution, in light of the Tornetta ruling and the high degree of public attention. Accordingly, these five directors unanimously voted to form the Committee and to appoint Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Joe Gebbia as members. 88 The Board charged the Committee with considering &#8220;whether it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to change its corporate domicile, and if so, to which jurisdiction.&#8221; 89 The Board expressly intended that the Committee &#8220;should be fully empowered to discharge its duties.&#8221; 90 Among other things, the Committee had the authority to: determine the Company&#8217;s decision on the reincorporation issue; consider all alternatives, including remaining in Delaware or reincorporating in any other jurisdiction; determine whether to condition any reincorporation on a particular stockholder vote standard; determine its own timing without any deadline; select and retain advisors at the Company&#8217;s expense; and obtain information from and direct the Company&#8217;s officers, employees, and advisors as it deemed necessary and appropriate. 91 In the Committee&#8217;s and its counsel&#8217;s judgment, the Committee was fully empowered to discharge its mandate. As the Committee and its counsel considered the incorporation question, they explored various scenarios and what might need to be done to implement any decision the Committee reached on incorporation. If the Committee determined that Tesla should remain incorporated in Delaware, then no stockholder vote&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and no disclosures&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;would be needed. But if the Committee determined that Tesla should reincorporate elsewhere, there would need to be a stockholder vote, and that vote would need to be informed. The Committee concluded that if it made a determination to reincorporate, Musk&#8217;s compensation should also be addressed in some way at the same time. Otherwise, a potential reincorporation could be wrongly perceived as being made in response to the Tornetta ruling and with the intent to award Musk compensation in a different jurisdiction that he could not get in Delaware. And, if stockholders were not told of any then-existing plans for Musk&#8217;s compensation, the reincorporation vote could be subject to attack as not fully informed. &#8203; 87 See 2/4/24 Board minutes. 88 See 2/10/24 Board minutes. James Murdoch did not attend the meeting because of a scheduling conflict, but later confirmed his agreement with the Board&#8217;s determinations. 89 Id. 90 Id. 91 Id. &#160; E-25 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Accordingly, the Committee and its counsel discussed how Musk&#8217;s compensation might be addressed if there were a decision to reincorporate. Wilson-Thompson is a member of the Board&#8217;s Compensation Committee, and she was aware that Musk had made it clear that he believes it is unfair to not be paid for his work as agreed. She was also aware that the Company was evaluating options, and that the Compensation Committee had not taken any steps to prepare or negotiate a new, forward-looking compensation plan. The Committee instructed its counsel to inquire about the Company&#8217;s current plans, if any, regarding Musk&#8217;s compensation. The Committee&#8217;s counsel learned that an appeal of the Tornetta ruling was being planned, and the Company also was evaluating seeking ratification of Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan via a new stockholder vote. In light of this information, the Committee and its counsel determined to request that the Board expand the Committee&#8217;s authority. The Board did so on March&#160;5, 2024, as requested. Specifically, the Board delegated additional authority to the Committee to decide whether, if there is a stockholder vote on reincorporation, Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan should be ratified at the same time, as well as potential disclosures about Musk&#8217;s compensation that might need to be made to ensure stockholders were informed in voting on reincorporation. The Board intended to fully empower the Committee on this second aspect of its mandate as well, and the Committee and its counsel concluded it was again fully empowered. In addition to the powers it already had, the Committee gained the authority to: determine the Company&#8217;s decision on the ratification question; consider all alternatives, including not seeking ratification of the 2018 grant; and determine whether to condition any ratification on a particular stockholder vote standard. 92 On March&#160;6, 2024, after the Board expanded the Committee&#8217;s mandate, Gebbia withdrew from the Committee. Gebbia explained that he was stepping down out of an abundance of caution because of the potential for unfair attacks based on perceived conflicts of interest: As part of the process of the Committee examining its own independence, I raised the fact that I have a personal relationship with Elon Musk, as well as a potential business transaction through Samara with him (which is currently on hold). The Committee and its counsel have concluded that I am nonetheless independent and disinterested in considering whether Tesla should remain incorporated in Delaware or reincorporate elsewhere. I also have no doubt that I could and would be able to make an independent determination on the reincorporation question based on what is best for Tesla and all of its shareholders, as I do on all Board matters. That said, I have been aware of, and reflecting on, the possibility of an unfair attack on the Committee based on my relationship with Elon. With the expansion of the Committee&#8217;s mandate to also address potential disclosures or a shareholder vote about Elon&#8217;s compensation, I have concluded that, out of an abundance of caution, stepping down from the Committee is for the best, particularly given the level of scrutiny this Committee is likely to face. Although neither my relationship with Elon nor anything about the substance of this decision would compromise my integrity or judgment in any way, I recognize that my relationship with him could be used to attack the Committee and its conclusions. Such an attack would be unjustified, but the work of this Committee is too important to run that risk. I have not reached this decision lightly. But the combination of these factors, among others, including personal considerations, has caused me to conclude that it would be best for the Committee, for Tesla, and for myself if I withdrew. 93 Gebbia stepped down entirely of his own accord, and not because of any concern by the Committee or its counsel regarding his independence. The expansion of the Committee&#8217;s mandate did not alter the Committee&#8217;s or its counsel&#8217;s conclusion regarding Gebbia&#8217;s independence. They believed that Gebbia was in fact independent and disinterested for both the incorporation and the ratification questions. After Gebbia stepped down, Wilson-Thompson became a &#8220;committee of one.&#8221; The Committee and its counsel discussed with the Board Chair, the Nominating and Governance Committee Chair, and management the possibility of accelerating the in-process search for new independent directors, and adding any new director(s) to the Committee. The timing of the ongoing director search ultimately did not fit with the Committee&#8217;s work, and the Committee determined there was no reason to delay its work based on the possibility that additional directors would be added to the Board at some point in the future. &#8203; 92 See 3/5/24 Board minutes. 93 3/7/24 Joe Gebbia email to Board Chair Robyn Denholm. &#160; E-26 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#160; II. The Committee&#8217;s Advisors. &#8203; Sidley Austin LLP. &#160;&#160;&#160;Sidley is a global law firm with 21 offices, approximately 2,300 lawyers, and $3&#160;billion in revenue in 2023. Sidley is particularly well-known for its premier public company advisory, corporate governance, and shareholder litigation practices. Kristen Seeger &amp; John Skakun. &#160;&#160;&#160;Seeger and Skakun were retained by the Committee as its lead counsel following an interview and diligence process. Seeger is a member of Sidley&#8217;s Executive Committee and co-leads the firm&#8217;s global Commercial Litigation and Disputes practice. Seeger and Skakun have led some of the largest and most significant securities class actions and fiduciary duty cases in the nation. They have deep experience representing public companies, boards, and special committees in high-profile and sensitive matters, including shareholder litigation and governance matters involving Delaware law. Other Sidley Lawyers. &#160;&#160;&#160;More than 40 other Sidley lawyers assisted with the representation of the Committee, including prominent members of Sidley&#8217;s public company advisory practice, securities and shareholder litigation practice, corporate governance practice, shareholder activism and corporate defense practice, and tax practice. In particular, Seeger and Skakun were supported by a core team with significant experience in board and shareholder matters, including Liz Austin, Anika Hermann Bargfrede, Larry Fogel, and Katie LaVoy. Additionally, Gary Gerstman, Yolanda Garcia, and George Vlahakos had key roles in advising the Committee on Delaware and Texas law. Gerstman advises Delaware companies on a wide variety of M&amp;A and strategic transactions, counsels public companies on a broad range of corporate governance matters, and is a global co-leader of Sidley&#8217;s Technology Industry Group. Garcia co-leads Sidley&#8217;s Securities and Shareholder Litigation practice, and regularly represents companies in shareholder litigation under Delaware law and Texas law. Vlahakos is co-managing partner of Sidley&#8217;s Houston office, and advises both Delaware and Texas companies on a broad range of transactional and corporate governance matters. Other Advisors. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee also determined that it would benefit from being advised by Delaware counsel, a corporate law and governance expert, and an investment bank. For each role, Sidley assessed multiple leading candidates, with a focus on both quality and independence. Sidley recommended and the Committee retained the following additional advisors. A. Thompson Bayliss, Abrams &amp; Bayliss LLP. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee engaged Bayliss as Delaware counsel, and he advised the Committee on its process and relevant aspects of Delaware law for both reincorporation and ratification. Bayliss is a highly-regarded Delaware lawyer with extensive experience representing parties in corporate, fiduciary duty, and other governance disputes before the Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court. Professor Anthony Casey, University of Chicago Law School. &#160;&#160;&#160;Professor Casey served as the Committee&#8217;s corporate law and governance expert. He advised the Committee on a wide range of matters relevant to the incorporation question, including the academic literature on corporate law and incorporation generally, as well as on the corporate laws of specific states considered by the Committee. Professor Casey is the Donald M. Ephraim Professor of Law and Economics at the University of Chicago Law School. He has researched, written about, and taught corporate governance and business law, finance, and corporate bankruptcy. He was previously a partner at Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP. Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;Houlihan was the Committee&#8217;s financial advisor. Houlihan is a leading global investment bank that is regularly engaged to provide financial advisory services, including to independent committees of boards of directors. III. The Committee&#8217;s Independence. &#8203; The Committee concluded that it is independent and disinterested with respect to all aspects of its mandate. This conclusion rested on an evaluation of the Committee (i.e., Wilson-Thompson) by counsel, as well as the Committee&#8217;s evaluation of the independence and disinterestedness of its counsel and other advisors. Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. &#160;&#160;&#160;Sidley conducted an independence interview of Wilson-Thompson shortly after being retained, re-evaluated her independence after the Committee&#8217;s mandate was expanded, and confirmed her independence at the end of the process. Seeger and Skakun concluded that Wilson-Thompson was independent and disinterested in discharging the Committee&#8217;s full mandate, based on the following factors. &#160; E-27 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Joined Board As Independent Director Pursuant To SEC Approval. &#160;&#160;&#160;Wilson-Thompson joined Tesla&#8217;s Board in connection with the Company&#8217;s September&#160;29, 2018, settlement with the SEC. That settlement obligated Tesla to appoint two independent directors, of which Wilson-Thompson was one. She was identified as an independent director candidate through a search process conducted by Russell Reynolds Associates, and her appointment to the Board was effective December&#160;27, 2018. Wilson-Thompson was appointed to the Disclosure Controls Committee shortly after joining the Board, and her membership of that Committee as an independent director was subject to approval by the SEC for the duration of the settlement&#8217;s term. Wilson-Thompson continues to serve in this oversight role. No Compromising Personal Or Financial Ties. &#160;&#160;&#160;When she joined the Board in 2018, Wilson-Thompson had no social or business connections to Musk or any other Tesla director. That has not changed. Wilson-Thompson is now friendly with all of the directors and a number of the Company&#8217;s officers, but she does not have personal relationships with any of them. She does not attend significant social events (weddings, vacations, etc.) with other directors or officers. She does not have meaningful charitable ties to other directors or officers; she is the immediate past Chair of the Board of Directors of the University of Michigan Alumni Association, but no one else from Tesla is on that Board. She lives in Chicago, but no other director or officer does. She has no business dealings with, or investments in any entities affiliated with, any other directors or officers, including Musk. Wilson-Thompson has realized a pre-tax total of approximately $62&#160;million from the exercise of equity awards received for her service on the Board and, as disclosed in public filings, currently beneficially owns 771,255 shares. 94 This is a meaningful portion of her net worth. The Committee&#8217;s counsel believes that these equity interests fully align Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s interests with the interests of all Tesla stockholders. The value of her awards is the result of the significant increase in the Company&#8217;s stock price since 2018, which has benefited Wilson-Thompson in identical proportion to all stockholders. The Committee&#8217;s counsel also believes that her share ownership does not render her beholden to anyone. Her awards were the only compensation she has received for serving on Tesla&#8217;s Board, they were fully disclosed and are consistent with the compensation of all outside directors during her period of service, and for a period after their issuance they were underwater. Furthermore, Wilson-Thompson last received an award in June&#160;2019, and all of her options fully vested by June&#160;2022; none of her equity interests are dependent in any way on her continued service on the Board and cannot be reduced by any director or officer of Tesla, including Musk. 95 Her current wealth also means she is not financially dependent on remaining a Tesla director. 96 Nor does Wilson-Thompson have any compromising political, charitable, or other ties to any of the jurisdictions that were under consideration by the Committee as a potential place of incorporation. Wilson-Thompson and her husband have endowed a scholarship at the University of North Texas, and since 2014 her husband has served on the board of the Greater Texas Foundation, an organization that promotes equal opportunity in postsecondary education for Texas students. The UNT endowment, established in honor of a long-time friend, is one of multiple scholarships funded by Wilson-Thompson and her husband at educational institutions across the country, including institutions in Florida, New York, and Michigan. Wilson-Thompson has no significant connection to Delaware. National Reputation As A Public Company Director &amp; Officer. Wilson-Thompson has served in senior management and director roles at public companies for three decades. She served as Executive Vice President and &#8203; 94 2023 Proxy Statement at 57. 95 In 2020, a stockholder brought a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Tesla Board, including Wilson-Thompson, alleging that the Board awarded itself unfair and excessive compensation from 2017 through 2020. Police and Fire Ret. Sys. of the City of Detroit v. Musk , No. 2020-0477-KSJM (Del. Ch.). The matter was settled. Among other things, the directors collectively agreed to return options and other compensation worth $735&#160;million, to forgo options awarded in 2021 and 2022, and to forgo any compensation for Board service in 2023. The settlement further provides that on a going-forward basis, the compensation of all non-employee directors, including Wilson-Thompson, will be put to a stockholder vote on an annual basis. The settlement is pending court approval. 96 As disclosed in the Company&#8217;s 2020 and 2021 proxy statements, Tesla determined not to renew its directors and officers liability insurance for the 2019-2020 year. For that year, and for a 90-day interim period in 2020, Musk agreed with Tesla to personally provide substantially equivalent coverage. The Board concluded that because the arrangement was governed by a binding agreement with Tesla and Musk did not have unilateral discretion to perform, and the arrangement was intended to replace an ordinary course insurance policy, it would not impair the independent judgment of the other members of the Board. &#160; E-28 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Global Chief Human Resources Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. from December&#160;2014 until her retirement in January&#160;2021, and as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer from January&#160;2010 to December&#160;2014. Wilson-Thompson held various legal and operational roles at Kellogg Company from January&#160;1991 to December&#160;2009, including as its Senior Vice President, Global Human Resources. Wilson-Thompson currently serves as a director of two other public companies, Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (since May&#160;2021) and McKesson Corporation (since January&#160;2022). She previously served as a director of two other public companies, Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (2017 to 2020) and Vulcan Materials Company (2009 to 2018). Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s accomplishments and national reputation as a business leader were built by her own hard work and skills. She grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, the child of a millwright at General Motors and a junior high school teacher. She graduated from the University of Michigan and earned two law degrees from Wayne State University, a JD as well as an LLM in corporate and finance law. She rose through the ranks to the C-Suite at two iconic Fortune 500 public companies. No aspect of Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s personal success or business reputation is the result of any connection to Tesla or Musk. Demonstrated Commitment To Independence During This Process. &#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the Committee&#8217;s work, Wilson-Thompson stated and demonstrated that she would fairly consider all alternatives and would make a decision based only on what she believed to be in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;regardless of what Musk may say or do. Seeger and Skakun observed this commitment first-hand. They participated in every Committee meeting with Wilson-Thompson, and had near-daily communications with her. They observed her integrity and principles, and never observed anything remotely resembling a so-called &#8220;controlled mindset.&#8221; To the contrary, Wilson-Thompson focused on fully exploring the merits of the matters before the Committee and reaching decisions based solely on the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s independence was also supported by Tesla&#8217;s other directors. Seeger and Skakun participated in interviews of every director, and they observed express support of, and sensitivity to, Wilson-Thompson&#8217;s independence. Seeger and Skakun never observed nor learned of any attempt by any director or officer of Tesla to control the Committee or its process. Sidley. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee assessed Sidley&#8217;s independence both before and after retention. Sidley had previously represented Tesla in two matters, for which it received $2,601 in fees in October&#160;2021, and $10,000 in fees in January&#160;2017. These amounts are immaterial to Sidley; it collected $3&#160;billion in revenue in 2023. Sidley&#8217;s conflicts search found no record of any other representation of Tesla or any of its directors, other than a prior representation of Wilson-Thompson as a witness before she joined Tesla&#8217;s Board. Sidley has no material representations for any other Musk-related entities, and to the contrary is representing certain former executives of X Corp. (formerly Twitter, Inc.) in litigation against Musk and X Corp. The Committee also specifically scrutinized the independence of Seeger and Skakun given their roles. Neither Seeger nor Skakun own, or have ever owned, any Tesla stock or any investment in any Musk-related business. Neither have any personal connection with, or had ever met, any Tesla director or officer prior to this engagement, other than Wilson-Thompson. The Committee therefore found that Seeger, Skakun, and Sidley are independent. Other Advisors. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee and its counsel also assessed the independence of each of the Committee&#8217;s other advisors, and only retained advisors determined to be independent. Bayliss, Delaware Counsel. &#160;&#160;&#160;Bayliss&#8217;s law firm, Abrams &amp; Bayliss LLP, has had two relevant prior engagements. Neither involved Bayliss, neither was financially or reputationally material to the firm in his view, and neither were led by any current partners in the firm or any lawyers involved in this engagement. First, at the recommendation of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, Musk retained Abrams &amp; Bayliss from January&#160;2019 to September&#160;2020 in connection with non-public, Delaware-law-related insurance and contribution issues arising from the litigation over Tesla&#8217;s acquisition of SolarCity. The firm was paid $224,935.80 for that work. Second, at the recommendation of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP, Tesla retained Abrams &amp; Bayliss in a books and records case styled Wagner v. Tesla, Inc. from December&#160;2021 to October&#160;2022. The firm was paid $153,824.98 for that work. &#160; E-29 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Professor Casey, Corporate Law &amp; Governance Expert. &#160;&#160;&#160;Casey is a tenured professor at the University of Chicago Law School. He has no social or financial connections to Tesla, Musk, or any Musk-related entity. The University of Chicago Law School has never received any donations from Tesla, Musk, or any Musk-related entity. 97 Houlihan, Financial Advisor. &#160;&#160;&#160;Houlihan searched its records for the last 3&#160;years and identified no prior retention by Tesla or Musk. Nor do any of Houlihan&#8217;s senior team members for this matter own any Tesla stock. IV. The Committee&#8217;s Diligence. &#8203; Over the course of 8 weeks, the Committee and its counsel devoted an enormous amount of time and attention to this matter. Wilson-Thompson spent more than 200 hours on the Committee&#8217;s work. Seeger and Skakun each spent more than 600 hours. In total, Sidley attorneys spent more than 4,000 hours on the matter. Delaware counsel Abrams &amp; Bayliss LLP spent more than 100 hours, and Professor Casey spent more than 190 hours. Wilson-Thompson directed all aspects of the Committee&#8217;s work. She actively participated in every meeting. She regularly spoke with Seeger and Skakun outside of Committee meetings as well, raising her thoughts, comments, and questions for discussion and consideration. She reviewed an extensive set of written materials. She participated in every interview. She oversaw the drafting of this Report. A summary of her diligence follows. 98 Committee Meetings. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee met 16 times for more than 26 hours. Wilson-Thompson, Seeger, and Skakun attended every Committee meeting, and Wilson-Thompson attended 13 of the meetings in-person at Sidley&#8217;s Chicago office. All 12 meetings after Wilson-Thompson became a committee of one were conducted in-person. Wilson-Thompson reviewed and approved the Committee&#8217;s minutes after they were initially prepared by Sidley. The Committee&#8217;s meetings were often lengthy and involved substantive back-and-forth and questioning by Wilson-Thompson. For example, three meetings were seminars with Professor Casey, which explored the history and development of corporate law in the US, and key aspects of corporate law across various US jurisdictions. Two other meetings were multi-hour panel discussions with practitioners regarding Delaware and Texas law, moderated by Professor Casey. These panel discussions delved into key aspects of corporate law and stockholder litigation, and comparisons between the two states. There were also standalone follow-up meetings about each of Delaware and Texas, including one meeting where the strongest case was made to the Committee for each state. In those panel discussions and follow-up meetings, Bayliss and Gerstman addressed Delaware law, and Garcia and Vlahakos addressed Texas law. Wilson-Thompson helped identify key topics and questions for the panel and follow-up meetings, and actively engaged in the discussions. Information Considered By The Committee. &#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the process, the Committee and its counsel evaluated what information would be necessary and helpful in discharging its mandate. Sidley and the other advisors gathered a substantial amount of information that was publicly available or which they had access to. 99 At the Committee&#8217;s direction, Sidley made a number of requests to the Company for information, all of which were fulfilled. All of the information received by the Committee was reviewed by Sidley, and much of it was reviewed by Wilson-Thompson. Information Requested And Received From The Company. &#160;&#160;&#160;The information received from the Company and considered by the Committee included: &#8226; Board minutes and resolutions regarding the creation and authorization of the Committee. &#8203; &#8226; Director independence questionnaires for the Committee&#8217;s members. &#8203; &#8226; All final Board and Board committee minutes from 2023 and 2024. &#8203; &#8203; 97 Former Tesla director Antonio Gracias is a member of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees, but does not serve on any body of the Law School. 98 A list of Special Committee meetings is attached as Exhibit&#160;A, a list of Special Committee interviews is attached as Exhibit&#160;B, and a list of documents reviewed by Kathleen Wilson-Thompson is attached as Exhibit&#160;C. 99 Sidley retained Edelman Smithfield to gather and provide relevant public statements in light of the significant public interest. Sidley also used its internal library personnel to gather certain data, publications, and other information. &#160; E-30 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; &#8226; Stockholder communications regarding reincorporation or Musk&#8217;s compensation. &#8203; &#8226; The Company&#8217;s position on any potential materially adverse tax, accounting, contractual, regulatory, or securities effects from reincorporation or of ratification. &#8203; &#8226; The Company&#8217;s position and plans regarding Musk&#8217;s compensation. &#8203; &#8226; The Company&#8217;s position on how to effectuate any potential reincorporation or ratification. &#8203; Materials Reviewed By Wilson-Thompson. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee requested a significant amount of information from its counsel and other advisors. Much of this information was analyzed and presented during Committee meetings. Outside of Committee meetings, Wilson-Thompson reviewed more than 140 documents totaling more than 2,000 pages. These included: &#8226; Materials analyzing the corporate laws of selected jurisdictions, including 40-plus-page memos summarizing the corporate laws of Delaware and Texas. &#8203; &#8226; Professor Casey&#8217;s report to the Committee. &#8203; &#8226; Houlihan&#8217;s report to the Committee. &#8203; &#8226; Academic articles regarding corporate law and incorporation, including articles analyzing any impact on economic value and potential differences across jurisdictions. &#8203; &#8226; Proxy statements by other Delaware companies that reincorporated, and the related reports by Glass Lewis and ISS. &#8203; &#8226; Communications from Tesla stockholders regarding a potential reincorporation and regarding the Tornetta case. &#8203; &#8226; Relevant Delaware cases, including the SolarCity opinion (April&#160;2022), the Tornetta opinion (January&#160;2024), and the TripAdvisor opinion (February&#160;2024). &#8203; &#8226; Certain presentations from the March&#160;2024 Corporate Law Institute Conference at Tulane University. &#8203; &#8226; A summary of fiduciary duties for Special Committees under Delaware law. &#8203; Interviews. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee and its counsel interviewed 12 individuals to gather information. The Company granted every interview request, and every interviewee answered all of the Committee&#8217;s questions. The Committee and its counsel interviewed the other directors regarding their prior consideration of reincorporation (if any), their views on Tesla&#8217;s mission and its importance to the Company, and their views on the strategic importance of Tesla&#8217;s various physical locations and operations, as well as the Company&#8217;s relationships with those jurisdictions. The Committee did not interview Elon Musk or Kimbal Musk until after it had reached a decision on both reincorporation and ratification. No aspect of either of those interviews caused the Committee to rethink its decisions. The Committee and its counsel also interviewed 5 members of management: Tom Zhu, SVP, Automotive; Martin Viecha, VP, Investor Relations; Joseph Gruber, VP, Tax; Harsh Rungta, Director, Automotive Revenue and Energy Business Controller; Eric Lussier, Senior Technical Accounting Manager.

[The rest of this page is intentionally left blank.] &#160; E-35 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Part&#160;3: The Special Committee&#8217;s Cross-Checks At every step of the Committee&#8217;s work, the Committee and its counsel were mindful of Delaware case law addressing special committees and their operation. Wilson-Thompson personally reviewed almost all of the cases cited in this Part&#160;3, and discussed them at length with Sidley, Bayliss, and Professor Casey. The Committee and its advisors noted in particular the multiple Delaware opinions about Tesla itself, specifically the SolarCity opinions 101 and Tornetta . 102 The Committee constructed its process in light of, and checked its work against, the guidance Delaware courts have provided to directors, including to Tesla&#8217;s directors specifically. Additionally, early in the Committee&#8217;s process, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued its TripAdvisor decision, which addressed a proposed reincorporation outside of Delaware pursuant to DGCL &#167;&#160;266, 103 and later issued a ruling denying interlocutory appeal in the same case. 104 The Committee incorporated the TripAdvisor opinions into its thinking as well. In light of these cases, the Committee conducted a number of cross-checks: It focused on the Delaware courts&#8217; particular emphasis on the independence and diligence of single-member committees. It was attentive to replicating arm&#8217;s-length bargaining with the Company, including to secure protections for all of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. And it sought to identify any potential non-ratable benefits from a reincorporation, i.e., benefits to directors or significant stockholders that are not shared in equal proportion with stockholders as a whole. Committee Of One. &#160;&#160;&#160;In SolarCity , the Court of Chancery provided the following guidance to Tesla in unequivocal terms: This point cannot be emphasized enough. There was a right way to structure the deal process within Tesla that likely would have obviated the need for litigation and judicial second guessing of fiduciary conduct. First and foremost, Elon should have stepped away from the Tesla Board&#8217;s consideration of the Acquisition entirely, providing targeted input only when asked to do so under clearly recorded protocols . The Tesla Board should have formed a special committee comprised of indisputably independent directors, even if that meant it was a committee of one . 105 The Tornetta decision similarly criticized the process of setting Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan, because the Board had not created a &#8220;well-functioning committee of independent directors.&#8221; 106 The Committee took these statements seriously, and worked at all times to structure its process the &#8220;right way&#8221; as these decisions instructed. First , the Committee, the Board, and Musk himself all ensured that he &#8220;stepped away from&#8221; the Committee&#8217;s process and its decisions. Musk did not participate in the Board meeting that formed the Committee. Musk did not attempt to influence or control the Committee. He never directly or indirectly reached out to Wilson-Thompson or the Committee&#8217;s counsel about the Committee&#8217;s work. 107 The Committee chose to interview Musk regarding certain matters relevant to its work, including whether, and why, the 2018 compensation plan was important to him. But it did so only under &#8220;clearly recorded protocols.&#8221; Specifically, that discussion occurred in a single interview &#8203; 101 In re Tesla Motors, Inc. Stockholder Litig. (&#8220; SolarCity &#8221;), 2022 WL 1237185 (Del. Ch. Apr. 27, 2022); In re Tesla Motors, Inc. Stockholder Litig. (&#8220; SolarCity II &#8221;), 298 A.3d 667 (Del. 2023). 102 Tornetta v. Musk , 310 A.3d 430 (Del. Ch. Jan. 30, 2024). The Tornetta ruling remains subject to appeal, but the Committee nonetheless considered it as relevant to this process. 103 TripAdvisor , 2024 WL 678204 (Del. Ch. Feb. 20, 2024). 104 TripAdvisor II , 2024 WL 1211688 (Del. Ch. Mar. 21, 2024). 105 SolarCity , 2022 WL 1237185, at *33 fn. 397 (emphasis added). 106 Tornetta , 310 A.3d at 521. That decision also found that the stockholder vote was not fully informed because the &#8220;Proxy failed to disclose any of the Compensation Committee members&#8217; actual or potential conflicts with respect to Musk&#8221; and also did not supply &#8220;a full and accurate description of the material steps in the board or committee process that resulted in the transaction.&#8221; Id. at 522-25. This finding informed the Committee as well, in particular with regard to its decision, discussed in more detail below, to provide its Report to stockholders in full. 107 During Gebbia&#8217;s period of service on the Committee, Musk never attempted to contact him regarding the Committee&#8217;s work either. &#160; E-36 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; led by Seeger and Skakun. And it was conducted only after the Committee arrived at a decision with regard to both portions of its mandate, independent of Musk&#8217;s views. 108 Second , after Gebbia chose to step off the Committee, the Committee continued its work &#8220;even [though] that meant it was a committee of one,&#8221; per SolarCity .&#160;&#160;&#160;Wilson-Thompson understood that as the sole member of the Committee, she would be held to &#8220;unyielding standards of diligence and independence.&#8221; 109 The Committee and its counsel carefully considered the standards set out by Delaware courts in this context, and then consciously cross-checked their process design and execution to satisfy themselves that the Committee should withstand the additional scrutiny that may attach to a committee of one. Among other things: &#8226; The Committee confirmed it was &#8220;delegated . . . full authority and power&#8221; to decide the reincorporation question as well as the ratification question. 110 &#8203; &#8226; The Committee confirmed it &#8220;was authorized to retain independent advisors at [the Company&#8217;s] expense.&#8221; 111 &#8203; &#8226; The Committee extensively consulted with multiple Sidley lawyers, Bayliss, Professor Casey, and Houlihan. The Committee used them as a sounding board, and met with them repeatedly, both individually and in panel discussions designed to solicit multiple points of view. In those discussions, the advisors were expressly &#8220;tasked with challenging the committee&#8217;s thinking [and] presenting alternatives&#8221; to various possible considerations. 112 &#8203; &#8226; The Committee approached its process with &#8220;full vigor,&#8221; holding 16 formal meetings (13 of which were in-person), attending every interview, and presenting its decisions to the Board&#8217;s outside directors. 113 Wilson-Thompson devoted more than 200 hours to her work, including Committee meetings, interviews, review of materials, consideration of key issues, and speaking with Seeger and/or Skakun virtually every day. &#8203; &#8226; The Committee worked to explore &#8220;all relevant facts and sources of information that bear on&#8221; the questions before it. 114 In addition to discussions with its advisors, the Committee interviewed all 7 other directors and 5 members of management, spoke with the Company&#8217;s external auditor, instructed its counsel to request relevant information from the Company, and reviewed documents including Professor Casey&#8217;s report, Houlihan&#8217;s report, numerous legal decisions, letters from stockholders, and academic articles. &#8203; &#8226; The Committee instructed Sidley to conduct a thorough independence review, and committed to periodically reexamine independence during the process. The independence inquiry was especially wide-ranging, and reflected matters raised in SolarCity and Tornetta .&#160;&#160;&#160;The review with respect to Wilson-Thompson included, among other things, her compensation for service on the Board, any attendance at significant social events (weddings, vacations, etc.) with other directors or officers, and any business dealings with, or investments in &#8203; &#8203; 108 The same was true of Kimbal Musk. The Committee&#8217;s only contact with him regarding its work was a single interview led by counsel and conducted after the Committee arrived at its decisions. 109 In re Baker Hughes, A GE Co., Derivative Litig. , 2023 WL 2967780, at *11 (Del.

Wilson-Thompson also directly engaged in certain additional negotiations regarding the date of the annual stockholder meeting. With persistent and at times intense efforts, the Committee secured multiple protections for the benefit of the Company and all of its stockholders: Timing. &#160;&#160;&#160;The Committee took particular note of timing considerations, given the court&#8217;s comments in Tornetta that the process was flawed because &#8220;most of the work on the compensation plan occurred during small segments of [time] and under significant time pressure imposed by Musk,&#8221; and &#8220;Musk dictated the timing of the process, making last-minute changes to the timeline or altering substantive terms immediately prior to&#8221; board meetings. 119 Accordingly, one of the Committee&#8217;s first actions was to assess the time necessary to conduct its work. The Committee preferred that any stockholder vote, to the extent one occurred, take place at the annual meeting; that would give the greatest number of stockholders an opportunity to voice their views. The Company had been planning to hold its 2024 annual meeting on May&#160;8. The Committee concluded that would not provide an appropriate amount of time to complete its work, and subsequently spent several weeks negotiating to push back the meeting date. The Committee succeeded in moving the meeting by more than a month, to June&#160;13. It also remained in control of its timing at all times. If its work had not been complete in time for the annual meeting, it would not have made its recommendations and released its Report. There is nothing the Company tried to do, or could have done, that would have altered that. Disclosures. &#160;&#160;&#160;In Tornetta , the court concluded that the stockholder vote approving the compensation plan was not fully informed because the proxy statement for the vote did not disclose all material information. 120 In particular, the court found that the proxy statement did not disclose certain information regarding directors&#8217; potential conflicts and the Compensation Committee&#8217;s process. 121 Taking this guidance into account, the Committee determined to prepare this Report and negotiate with the Company to ensure that it would be provided to stockholders in its entirety with any proxy statement. The Committee also ensured that it was able to review the Company&#8217;s proposed disclosures related to its work. Majority of Non-Musk Votes Cast. &#160;&#160;&#160;In SolarCity , the Court lauded the Board&#8217;s decision to condition the transaction on the approval of a majority of disinterested stockholders as &#8220;one of the most extolled and powerful protections afforded Delaware stockholders.&#8221; 122 The Committee ensured that both stockholder votes it recommended were contingent upon approval of a majority of votes cast excluding the shares held by Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk. &#8203; 115 Tornetta , 310 A.3d at 456-59, 508-10 (cleaned up). 116 The Delaware Supreme Court&#8217;s Match decision, issued on April&#160;4, 2024, toward the end of the Committee&#8217;s process, addressed, among other things, committee independence standards. See In re Match Grp., Inc. Derivative Litig. , 2024 WL 1449815 (Del. Apr. 4, 2024). The decision reinforced the Committee&#8217;s and its counsel&#8217;s view that Wilson-Thompson is independent. Unlike the committee member at issue in Match , Wilson-Thompson does not &#8220;owe [her] success&#8221; in any way to Musk or Tesla. See id. at *18. 117 Tornetta , 310 A.3d at 511 (cleaned up). 118 SolarCity , 2022 WL 1237185, at *36. 119 Tornetta , 310 A.3d at 447. 120 Id. at 521. 121 Id. 122 SolarCity , 2022 WL 1237185, at *36 (cleaned up). &#160; E-38 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Non-Ratable Benefits and Other TripAdvisor Guidance. &#160;&#160;&#160;The TripAdvisor decision was particularly instructive for the Committee&#8217;s reincorporation work. TripAdvisor applied entire fairness review at the pleading stage because Nevada law allegedly &#8220;provides greater protection to fiduciaries and confers a material benefit on the [director] defendants,&#8221; i.e., a non-ratable benefit not shared equally in proportion with all stockholders. 123 The Court held that the conversions were adequately alleged to be not entirely fair because the &#8220;defendants did not make any effort to replicate arm&#8217;s-length bargaining,&#8221; and because &#8220;stockholders will not receive the substantial equivalent of what they had before&#8221; as a result of alleged differences between Nevada and Delaware litigation rights. 124 In response, the Committee intentionally sought to replicate arm&#8217;s-length bargaining and made &#8220;substantial equivalence&#8221; its touchstone when comparing Delaware and Texas law, as discussed above. Moreover, as a cross-check, the Committee expressly considered whether reincorporating in Texas would convey any non-ratable benefits on any of Tesla&#8217;s directors or officers, including Musk. None of the Committee&#8217;s advisors identified any such non-ratable benefit. 125 In the Committee&#8217;s view, litigation rights under Delaware and Texas law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including director and officer liability protections&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;are substantially equivalent. 126 Texas&#8217;s constituency statute did not alter this conclusion: although Delaware does not have an equivalent statute, the Committee does not believe that Texas&#8217;s constituency statute provides a material litigation protection for any directors or officers. 127 The Committee instead shares the views of the presentation at the March&#160;2024 Annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute, which noted that &#8220;better alignment of the Company&#8217;s values through a constituency statute&#8221; could be a ratable reason for reincorporation in another jurisdiction. 128 That is especially true here because Tesla is and always has been mission-driven.

Casey Report &#182; 140 (&#8220;In my view, the question is equally relevant for a decision to stay in Delaware as it is for a decision to reincorporate in another state. As such, I provide the analysis for both Delaware and Texas. I conclude that there is no non-ratable benefit for any director, officer, or particular shareholder associated with a decision to remain incorporated in Delaware. Nor is there any such benefit associated with a decision to reincorporate in Texas.&#8221;). 126 See Part&#160;1, Section&#160;I.B.1.c.; see also generally Casey Report. 127 TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401. 128 Pre-read materials for Delaware Developments panel, Tulane Corporate Law Institute (Mar. 7, 2024). &#160; E-39 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; Conclusion For the reasons stated in this Report, the Committee&#8217;s business judgment is that reincorporating in Texas and ratifying Musk&#8217;s compensation are in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders, and should be voted for by stockholders at Tesla&#8217;s 2024 annual meeting. Regarding reincorporation, the Committee recommended that: (1)&#160;the Board and management take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Committee&#8217;s determination consistent with legal obligations; (2)&#160;Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk be recused from the Board&#8217;s deliberations and from the vote on this matter, because of Elon Musk&#8217;s prior posts on X about reincorporation; (3)&#160;the stockholder vote on reincorporation be conditioned on approval by at least a majority of votes cast by non-Musk-affiliated stockholders, for the same reason; and (4)&#160;the Board recommend that stockholders vote for reincorporation based on the Committee&#8217;s determination that reincorporating in Texas is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders. Regarding ratification, the Committee recommended to the Board that: (1)&#160;the Board and management take all necessary and appropriate steps to implement the Committee&#8217;s ratification decision consistent with legal obligations; (2)&#160;Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk be recused from the Board&#8217;s deliberations and from the vote on this matter, because it concerns Elon Musk&#8217;s compensation; (3)&#160;the stockholder vote on ratification be conditioned on approval by at least a majority of votes cast by disinterested stockholders, in the same manner as the 2018 stockholder vote; (4)&#160;the Tornetta opinion be annexed to, and summarized in, the Company&#8217;s proxy statement; (5)&#160;the Company&#8217;s proxy statement address any other current plans regarding compensation for Elon Musk; and (6)&#160;the Board adopt appropriate ratification resolutions and recommend that stockholders vote for ratification based on the Committee&#8217;s determination that ratifying Musk&#8217;s 2018 compensation plan is in the best interests of Tesla and all of its stockholders. &#160; E-40 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Exhibits &#8203; &#8203; Exhibit &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Description &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; A &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Special Committee Meetings &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Special Committee Interviews &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; C &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Documents Reviewed by Kathleen Wilson-Thompson &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; D &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Report of Professor Anthony J.

Casey &#160; D-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; R eport of P rofessor A nthony J. C asey Re: Legal and Corporate Governance Considerations for Choosing State of Incorporation 1.&#160;&#160;&#160;In this report, I identify and evaluate the legal and corporate governance considerations relevant for choosing the state of incorporation for Tesla, Inc. I understand that this report will be considered by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Tesla, Inc. (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) in deciding whether to recommend that Tesla, Inc. remain incorporated in Delaware or reincorporate in a different state in the United States of America. I further understand that the Committee started its analysis with a broad look at all options (including potentially outside the U.S.) and iteratively narrowed its analysis to ten U.S. states, then five, and finally two states (Delaware and Texas) and is now deciding between Delaware and Texas. 2.&#160;&#160;&#160;While I do not make an ultimate recommendation in favor of incorporation in any state, I do identify key legal corporate governance factors for the Committee to consider. I then compare the core features of the corporate governance laws&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;both on paper and in practice&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as they currently exist in the two states under consideration. For each feature, I examine the differences between the regimes and evaluate how those differences might impact Tesla&#8217;s mission and operations, the value of Tesla to its shareholders, and the relative legal rights of its shareholders, directors, officers, and other stakeholders. 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;Where possible, I identify potential costs and benefits to Tesla and its shareholders associated with the choice of incorporation in a particular state under consideration. I note where potential differences in the corporate governance features of the states under consideration are not likely to have an impact on Tesla and its shareholders, directors, officers, and other stakeholders. I also evaluate the potential for the choice of incorporation in one state over another to provide a &#8220;non-ratable&#8221; benefit to a director, officer, or specific shareholder. 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;In presenting this analysis, I summarize the vast legal academic literature on the choice of state of incorporation and on several central questions including Delaware&#8217;s position as the dominant state for large-company incorporation, the long debate over whether incorporation in Delaware is associated with an increase or decrease in shareholder value, and the potential value to a corporation and its shareholders associated with home-state incorporation. I include a brief look at an emerging literature on potential costs associated with incorporation in the state of Nevada. 1 Given the volume of the academic literature on Delaware incorporation, I do not attempt a full literature review but rather highlight the findings and consensus views (when they exist) that will be relevant and useful to the Committee in making its decision. 5.&#160;&#160;&#160;In preparing this report, I have not assumed any special status of Delaware or any other state. Nor have I assumed that Tesla has made a decision or has any predetermined reason to depart from Delaware. In other words, to avoid any predetermination, status quo or salience bias, or path dependency, I have treated this as a decision from first principles about the costs and benefits to Tesla and its shareholders associated with the choice of incorporating in one state or another. 6.&#160;&#160;&#160;This report proceeds as follows: Part&#160;I summarizes my conclusions; Part&#160;II sets out my qualifications as an expert on corporate law and governance; Part&#160;III briefly describes the basis for this report and how it was prepared; Part&#160;IV provides a descriptive analysis of the potential sources of value differentials between the corporate governance regimes in the states under consideration; Part&#160;V presents my conclusions as to how the differences and similarities between corporate legal regimes in the states under consideration could potentially impact Tesla&#8217;s mission and operations, the value of Tesla to its shareholders, or the relative legal rights of Tesla&#8217;s shareholders, directors, officers, and other stakeholders. I. Summary of Conclusions &#8203; a. Relevant legal and corporate governance considerations &#8203; 7.&#160;&#160;&#160;In recommending the state in which Tesla should be incorporated, the Committee should consider the corporate governance features of the states under consideration. In doing so, it should take into account whether and how the corporate governance features associated with incorporation in any particular state affect Tesla&#8217;s mission and operations; whether and how the corporate governance features associated with incorporation in any particular &#8203; 1 While Nevada is not among the two states under consideration by the Committee, I understand that it was included in the list of ten and five states that the Committee considered before narrowing its decision to two. &#160; 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; state affect the value of Tesla to its shareholders; and whether and how the corporate governance features associated with incorporation in any particular state affect the legal rights of Tesla&#8217;s shareholders, directors, officers, and other stakeholders. In particular, the Committee should consider the following questions: i. Is there a discernable general difference in shareholder or corporate value (a &#8220;premium&#8221; or &#8220;discount&#8221;) associated with incorporation in a particular state? &#8203; ii. With regard to the application of corporate governance law, are differences in the predictability of courts and legal outcomes in a particular state likely to create a benefit associated with incorporation in a particular state? &#8203; iii. Are any features of a particular state or its corporate governance law likely to create a Tesla-specific benefit or cost associated with incorporation in that state? &#8203; iv. Will incorporation in a particular state provide increased or decreased protection of the legal rights of Tesla&#8217;s shareholders? &#8203; v. Because Tesla is currently incorporated in Delaware, and in light of the recent opinion of the Delaware Court of Chancery in Palkon v. Maffei , 2 the committee should also consider this question: Does incorporating Tesla in any particular state, including Delaware, 3 create a &#8220;non-ratable benefit&#8221; for any director, officer, or particular shareholder (including Elon Musk)? &#8203; 8.&#160;&#160;&#160;Below, I provide an analysis of each of these questions to assist the Committee in its decision. To summarize, I reach the following conclusions: i. No discernible general state premium (or discount). &#160;&#160;&#160;There is no discernible general value premium (or discount) associated with incorporation in Delaware, Texas, or any other state. &#8203; ii. Unknown effect from predictability. &#160;&#160;&#160;There are differences in the courts and the predictability of the application of corporate governance law in Texas and Delaware. Delaware has adopted a litigation-intensive, standards-based corporate governance regime. This system generates volatility and reduced predictability in legal outcomes related to complex corporate governance matters. Texas, like many other states, has a more code-based corporate governance regime. This system is likely to generate less volatility. On the other hand, Texas case law on corporate governance is far less developed than Delaware case law, and Texas is also launching a new business court later this year. These factors create some uncertainty about how Texas courts will apply Texas corporate governance law. Because these differences point in both directions, the impact on corporate and shareholder value is indeterminate. &#8203; iii. Tesla-specific benefit associated with incorporating in Texas. Potential Tesla-specific cost associated with incorporation in Delaware. &#160;&#160;&#160;Certain features of Texas corporate governance law are likely to create Tesla-specific benefits for the corporation and its shareholders. First, because Tesla is headquartered in Texas, there is likely a benefit to the corporation and its shareholders in Texas associated with home-state incorporation. Second, specific provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code explicitly authorize directors and officers to consider &#8220;social, charitable, or environmental purposes.&#8221; 4 These provisions are more closely aligned with Tesla&#8217;s stated corporate mission &#8220;to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy.&#8221; 5 This alignment creates the potential for a benefit to Tesla associated with incorporation in Texas. Additionally, Delaware&#8217;s corporate governance regime may disproportionally &#8203; &#8203; 2 Palkon v. Maffei , No. 2023-0449-JTL, 2024 WL 678204, (Del. Ch. Feb. 20, 2024). 3 While this point may not be obvious, the questions posed in Palkon v. Maffei are equally relevant for a decision to stay in Delaware. Directors of Delaware corporations owe fiduciary duties to the corporation and its shareholders in making all decisions. A decision to remain incorporated in Delaware is subject to those fiduciary duties in the same way as is a decision to reincorporate elsewhere. Cf. In re Citigroup Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation, 964 A.2d 106 at n. 78 (Del. Ch. 2009) (Chandler, C.) (Noting that a director&#8217;s duties in analyzing choices run in both directions. &#8220;If one expects director prescience in one direction, why not the other?&#8221;). 4 TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401(e). 5 https://www.tesla.com/impact. &#160; 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; incentivize litigation against larger innovative corporations. Because Tesla is a larger innovative firm, this dynamic would create a Tesla-specific cost associated with incorporation in Delaware. iv. No material difference in aggregate substantive shareholder protections. Potential increase in aggregate procedural shareholder protections in Texas. &#160;&#160;&#160;No state&#8217;s corporate governance regime definitively provides more aggregate substantive protection to shareholders. The substantive legal rights afforded to shareholders of Delaware corporations are substantially equivalent to the substantive legal rights afforded to shareholders of Texas corporations. But Texas corporate governance law may result in an increase in the aggregate procedural protection of shareholder rights. &#8203; v. No non-ratable benefits associated with incorporation in either state. &#160;&#160;&#160;There are no non-ratable benefits for any directors, officers, or specific shareholders associated with incorporation in either Delaware or Texas. There are no material differences in the substantive duties owed to a corporation and its shareholders in Delaware and Texas. Neither state allows for the elimination of liability that exists in the other state. Nor does either state have any procedural rules that materially alter the litigation exposure of directors, officers, or specific shareholders. Delaware&#8217;s elimination of the right to a jury trial and its limitations on discovery and forced concession of director independence in the demand context are procedural and not likely to be deemed material non-ratable benefits to directors, officers, or specific shareholders. The same is true of Texas&#8217;s universal demand requirement. &#8203; II.&#160;&#160;&#160;Qualifications and Background 9.&#160;&#160;&#160;I hold the position of Donald M.

Potential Drivers of Value Differentials between Corporate Governance Regimes in the States under Consideration &#8203; a. Delaware primacy in large-company incorporations &#8203; 25.&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware is the leading state for large-company incorporations. 6 It has become a common observation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;since at least the 1990s&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that public companies overwhelmingly choose to incorporate in one of two places: Delaware or their home state. 7 Various studies place Delaware&#8217;s share of all incorporations in the range &#8203; 6 Sarath Sanga, Network Effects in Corporate Governance , 63 J. L. Econ. 1 (2020) (&#8220;Delaware is the leader in corporate charters by a large margin.&#8221;). 7 See, for example, Robert Daines, The Incorporation Choices of IPO Firms , 77 N.Y.U. L. Rev.&#160;1559, 1562 (2002) (&#8220;97% of public firms incorporate either in their home state or Delaware.&#8221;); Lucian Bebchuk &amp; Alma Cohen, Firms&#8217; Decisions where to Incorporate , 46 J. L. Econ. 383, 389 (2003) (&#8220;58&#160;percent of all firms, 59&#160;percent of Fortune 500 firms, and even a higher percentage &#8212; 68&#160;percent&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;of firms that went public in the period 1996-2000&#8221; incorporate in Delaware.&#8221;); Michal Barzuza, Self-Selection and Heterogeneity in Firms&#8217; Choice of Corporate Law , 16 Theor. Inq. L. 295, 296 (2015) (&#8220;almost half of all public corporations choose to incorporate in their home states, in which their headquarters are located&#8221;); see also Sanga (2020) at 18 (&#8220;Half of all public corporations have been incorporated in Delaware at some time during their history as public companies. The next closest is California at 7&#160;percent, followed by New York at 6&#160;percent, Nevada at 3&#160;percent, and Florida at 3&#160;percent.&#8221;). &#160; 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; of 60% and its share of out-of-state incorporations in the range of 80%. 8 While these studies find that a small number of firms incorporate in other states, with the exception of Nevada, no other state has made significant in-roads in attracting out-of-state incorporations. 9 And, while Nevada has attracted an increasing number of incorporation in the last twenty&#160;years, it remains a distant second behind Delaware. 10 26.&#160;&#160;&#160;The primacy of Delaware in corporate law has attracted intense academic scrutiny. Questions related to this topic are among the most studied in all of corporate law scholarship. The history and magnitude of Delaware&#8217;s rise is well documented and there are numerous theories to explain the phenomenon. 11 Perhaps the core empirical question in all of corporate law is whether Delaware incorporation creates or destroys value for firms. This question&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;often framed as search for a &#8220;Delaware premium&#8221;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;has been studied for decades with no conclusive result. An emerging literature asks the same question for Nevada and has produced similarly inconclusive results. 27.&#160;&#160;&#160;In this section of the report, I start with a summary of the literature on the history of the rise of Delaware&#8217;s primacy. I then summarize the literature on the existence or nonexistence of a Delaware (or Nevada) premium, noting that the cumulative evidence suggests no discernible premium and no discernible discount. i. The history of Delaware primacy &#8203; 28.&#160;&#160;&#160;Though there is some debate about the details, the conventional story of Delaware primacy begins in New Jersey in the 1880s and 1890s. During that time, New Jersey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;seeking a new revenue source&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;consciously took affirmative steps to attract large corporations. 12 These measures included the following: &#8226; Permitting certain mergers (1888). &#8203; &#8226; Permitting the holding of stock in other corporations (1888). &#8203; &#8226; Permitting New Jersey corporations to operate outside of New Jersey (1889) without prior approvals (1892). &#8203; &#8226; Permitting certain vertical mergers (1893). &#8203; &#8226; Permitting broader holdings of stock in foreign corporations (1893). 13 &#8203; &#8203; 8 See, for example, Ofer Eldar &amp; Lorenzo Magnolfi, Regulatory Competition and the Market for Corporate Law , 12 Am. Econ. J. Microecon. 60, 66 (2020) (&#8220;Delaware&#8217;s share is about 63.86&#160;percent as of 2013, as compared with 50.09&#160;percent in 1995. Delaware&#8217;s market share of firms whose headquarters are located in a state that is not their state of incorporation out-of-state incorporations is even larger: 82.66&#160;percent as of 2013, as compared with 82.80&#160;percent in 1995.&#8221;). 9 Lucian A.

L. 249 (1976). 13 Grandy (1989) at 681. &#160; 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; These and other similar laws &#8220;were collected in the general corporation law revision of 1896.&#8221; 14 This statute also included provisions allowing corporations to be formed for any lawful purpose, removing limitations on the duration of corporate charters, allowing for classified shares, and allowing the issuance of non-voting stock. 15 29.&#160;&#160;&#160;These reforms were successful in achieving New Jersey&#8217;s aims. Revenues increased dramatically, 16 and by 1900 an estimated 95% of major corporations were incorporated in New Jersey. 17 30.&#160;&#160;&#160;New Jersey&#8217;s success drew competition from other states including Delaware, Maryland, Maine, New York, and West Virginia. 18 These states largely copied New Jersey&#8217;s reforms and competed on franchise tax rates and incorporation fees. 19 31.&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, Delaware was the clear winner of this competition. There are competing explanations for its success. As a starting point, some scholars have suggested that the competition for corporate charters favors smaller states like New Jersey and Delaware over larger states like New York. For a smaller state, a marginal incorporation fee represents a much larger share of the state&#8217;s annual budget and justifies more attention to the needs of corporations. Thus, states with smaller budgets can more credibly promise to update their law to keep corporations happy. 20 32.&#160;&#160;&#160;Additionally, New Jersey effectively removed itself from the competition in 1913, when Governor Woodrow Wilson led the state to adopt the reform provisions known as the &#8220;Seven Sisters,&#8221; which &#8220;reversed New Jersey corporate policy.&#8221; 21 The conventional story is that this ended New Jersey&#8217;s dominance in corporate charters and opened the door for Delaware&#8217;s quick rise to primacy in the space, a primacy that it has maintained for over a century. 22 33.&#160;&#160;&#160;Professor Sanga has questioned this story, noting that the beginning of New Jersey&#8217;s decline predated the adoption of the Seven Sisters in 1913. 23 Sanga suggests two alternative explanations: 1) the other states, and Delaware in particular, simply outcompeted New Jersey; and 2) the move out of New Jersey was taken in anticipation of progressive reforms in New Jersey, which the market predicted ahead of the enactment of the Seven Sisters. 24 34. In either event, the decline of New Jersey and the rise of Delaware in the second decade of the twentieth century is clear, as these charts from Professor Sanga&#8217;s work show: 25 &#8203; 14 Id. 15 Seligman (1976) at 265-66. 16 Grandy (1989) 682-83. 17 Seligman (1976) at 267. 18 Grandy (1989) at 685. 19 Id. 20 See Grandy (1989) at 686; Roberta Romano, Law as a Product: Some Pieces of the Incorporation Puzzle , J.

State Shares of New Corporate Charters (Moody&#8217;s Sample) Notes: This graph shows that New Jersey&#8217;s share of new corporate charters peaked before 1900 and subsequently declined. By the time New Jersey repealed its corporate law (in 1913), its share of the new charter market was close to zero. &#160; 8 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 35.&#160;&#160;&#160;During the period of competition, Delaware adopted similar governance laws to those in New Jersey. But its adoption of attractive corporate governance laws continued long after New Jersey had left the race. These measures culminated in the adoption in 1967 of the first version of today&#8217;s Delaware General Corporate Law. 36.&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the major developments in the emergence of Delaware&#8217;s corporate law include the following: &#8226; Adopting the General Corporation Act of 1899, which copied the New Jersey law &#8220;largely verbatim.&#8221; 26 This Act went further in some respects, including permitting &#8220;stock pyramiding,&#8221; 27 the ability to combine non-voting stock and layers of holding companies to convert minority ownership positions into a controlling position. 28 &#8203; &#8226; Permitting the inclusion of any provision in the certificate of incorporation &#8220;not contrary to the laws of th[e] State&#8221; 29 (1901). This provision increased the discretion of the directors in managing the corporation. &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;Grant[ing] the board of directors the power to sell all or substantially all corporate assets&#8221; with the approval of a stockholder vote (1917). 30 &#8203; &#8226; Eliminating of the requirement to provide pre-emptive rights on the issuance of new stock (1919). 31 &#8203; &#8226; Permitting the board of directors to issue &#8220;blank stock&#8221; and other stock options without amending the certificate of incorporation (1927). 32 &#8203; &#8226; Permitting shareholder voting by written consent (1937). 33 &#8203; &#8226; Permitting the corporation to indemnify its directors and officers (1943). 34 &#8203; &#8226; Permitting the board of directors to fill newly created directorships (1949). 35 &#8203; &#8226; Statutory overhaul&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;responding in part to increased competition from other states&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;resulting in the first version of the modern Delaware General Corporation Law (1967). 36 &#8203; 37.&#160;&#160;&#160;In the&#160;years immediately following the 1967 revision, the Delaware legislature was quick to amend the DGCL in response to recommendations by a committee of the state&#8217;s bar association. 37 38.&#160;&#160;&#160;The adoption of the DGCL in 1967 proved to be a significant moment in the rise of Delaware&#8217;s primacy for incorporations. 38 In the period following the adoption, Delaware saw a surge in reincorporations from other states. By 1974, 448 of the 1000 largest corporations were in Delaware. 39 &#8203; 26 Grandy (1989) at 685. 27 Id. 28 Seligman (1976) at 273. 29 Arsht (1976) at 9. 30 Id. at 10. 31 Seligman (1976) at 274. 32 Arsht (1976) at 11. 33 Id. 34 Id at 12. 35 Id. 36 Id. at 16. 37 Arsht (1976) at 17. 38 Sanga (2020). 39 Seligman (1976) at 283. &#160; 9 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 39. The largest surge in reincorporation into Delaware, however, did not occur until 1986 when Delaware adopted section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which allows for the exculpation of director liability for violations of the duty of care. These charts from Professor Sanga&#8217;s work demonstrate the importance of this moment in solidifying Delaware&#8217;s primacy: 40 &#8203; 40 Sanga (2020) at 5-6. &#160; 10 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 40.&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the post-1986 surge, Delaware&#8217;s dominance has remained firm. While Nevada has attracted some out-of-state incorporations in the last twenty&#160;years, it has not done so at the expense of Delaware&#8217;s market share. 41 41.&#160;&#160;&#160;While Delaware&#8217;s dominance is unquestionable, the effects of that Delaware dominance are less clear. As discussed below, the academics have failed to show a Delaware effect on firm value. This is, perhaps, unsurprising as the laws of most jurisdictions are similar. Indeed, with the creation and growing influence of the Model Business Corporation Act (which often adopts Delaware provisions) coupled with the fact that several states copy Delaware innovations in corporate law, there has been a general convergence of corporate law across the states. 42 ii. The academic search for a Delaware or other state premium &#8203; 42.&#160;&#160;&#160;Given Delaware&#8217;s unique position in the market for corporate charters, a core empirical question of corporate law scholarship has been whether Delaware incorporation creates or destroys value for firms. Despite decades of research on this question, the bulk of evidence suggests that there is no discernible premium (or discount). 43.&#160;&#160;&#160;The empirical debate arose in response to the theoretical question that dominated academic scholarship in the 1970s and 1980s. Scholars generally split into two camps: one arguing that competition among states for corporate charters resulted in a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; 43 and the other arguing that it resulted in a &#8220;race to the top.&#8221; 44 44.&#160;&#160;&#160;Various theories were put forth to support each view. The &#8220;race to the top&#8221; camp argued that market pressures would push managers to choose incorporation in the state that created the most value for investors. 45 The &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; crowd argued that states would cater to managerial interest to the disadvantage of shareholder value. 46 Others argued that state competition would lead to unpredictable law that encourages unnecessary litigation, 47 or that the race would be driven by a broader set of interest groups with ambiguous effects on corporate value. 48 45.&#160;&#160;&#160;Early studies produced some evidence which authors interpreted as supporting the &#8220;race to the top&#8221; argument.

Daines noted, however, that &#8220;[i]t is impossible to exclude the possibility that Delaware simply attracts valuable firms.&#8221; 54 47.&#160;&#160;&#160;Because of that limitation, Daines&#8217;s conclusions have been questioned by subsequent scholarship. Bebchuk and Cohen noted that &#8220;the endogeneity of incorporation decisions would make it impossible to infer that the correlation results from the positive effect of Delaware incorporation on firm value rather than from the tendency of firms with higher value to select Delaware.&#8221; 55 48.&#160;&#160;&#160;Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell also noted that Daines&#8217;s results showed a &#8220;deeply puzzling&#8221; year-to-year fluctuation in the Delaware premium. 56 Professor Subramanian further showed that the effect Daines identified was &#8220;driven by small firms&#8230;[a]nd even among these small firms, the Delaware effect disappears in the late 1990s.&#8221; 57 49.&#160;&#160;&#160;More recent studies have further drawn into question the existence of a Delaware premium. Professors Anderson and Manns looked at merger reincorporations from 2001 to 2011 to &#8220;show that Delaware law does not add to or subtract significant value from publicly traded companies.&#8221; 58 50.&#160;&#160;&#160;Professors Bartlett and Portnoy additionally showed significant flaws in the methodology for estimating Tobin&#8217;s Q in studies by Daines and others, concluding, &#8220;[S]cholars should view with suspicion any assertions about corporate law or corporate characteristics that are based&#8221; on that methodology. 59 51.&#160;&#160;&#160;Most recently, Professor Rhee looked at the value of Fortune 500 firms using six market multiples (&#8220;enterprise value to book value of assets, revenue, operating profit, and EBITDA, and multiples of market capitalization to book value of equity and net earnings&#8221;) to conclude that &#8220;Delaware companies do not enjoy a premium.&#8221; 60 &#8203; State Corporation Laws and Shareholders: The Recent Experience , 18 Fin.

Some scholars have theorized that Nevada corporate governance law is designed to attract managers seeking to extract value at the expense of shareholders. 61 The question then arises as to whether incorporation in Nevada is associated with a reduction in firm value. 53.&#160;&#160;&#160;In answering this question, two scholars have produced some evidence that lower quality firms choose to incorporate in Nevada. 62 But as with the Delaware studies, that evidence cannot differentiate between effects deriving from the types of firms selecting incorporation in Nevada and the effects resulting from that incorporation. 63 54.&#160;&#160;&#160;Professor Eldar reviews the Nevada literature and concludes, &#8220;[T]here seems to be no convincing evidence that incorporation in Nevada adversely affects share prices.&#8221; 64 He then conducts his own empirical study and concludes, &#8220;Taken together, the evidence supports the hypothesis that Nevada&#8217;s protectionist laws do not harm shareholder value and may in fact increase it for a subset of small firms that choose to incorporate in Nevada.&#8221; 65 b. Home-state incorporation &#8203; 55.&#160;&#160;&#160;As noted above, large corporations tend to incorporate in Delaware or in their home state. 66 Scholars have identified potential costs and benefits to firms associated with home-state incorporation. This section of the report briefly identifies the possible mechanism by which home-state incorporation could create a benefit for a corporation. 56.&#160;&#160;&#160;The first mechanism is the relationship with local regulators and local government actors. Home-state incorporation might provide a more friendly regulatory environment. 67 On the operational side, firms that incorporate in a state separate from their headquarters and main operations may alienate the regulators who impact their day-to-day operations. Firms that incorporate at home, on the other hand, may experience a better relationship and more access to local regulators. On the governance side, legislators in a firm&#8217;s home state might be more attentive and attuned to how corporate governance law might interact with the firm&#8217;s day-to-day operations and how governance laws might affect stakeholders such as employees or the communities in which a firm operates. More negatively, some scholars have theorized that home-state incorporation might foster lobbying by managers for their personal benefit in the form of takeover protections that are costly for shareholders. 68 While there are anecdotes of firms lobbying for protective legislation, 69 there is no empirical evidence that such lobbying is more effective in a firm&#8217;s home state than in Delaware. 57.&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, home-state incorporation may also facilitate better relationships with other constituencies such as employees and the communities in which those employees reside. Incorporating in the same state in which the firm has its headquarters or major operations signals a commitment to that community that is not present when it incorporates in Delaware or other states. &#8203; 61 Barzuza (2012), Barzuza &amp; Smith (2014); Michal Barzuza (2015); Michal Barzuza , Nevada v.

This can be important when corporate governance litigation overlaps with the firm&#8217;s operations. 71 Professor Lipton has noted the importance of such ties in certain cases and pointed out that even the Delaware Court of Chancery has criticized the oversized influence of Delaware law on external communities: A Delaware Vice Chancellor recently lamented that &#8220;Delaware should not be determining employment law for the country and for the world.&#8221; 72 60.&#160;&#160;&#160;Similar points about the importance of tying litigation to the communities most affected by the subject matter of the litigation have been raised in the decades-long debate about venue shopping in the context of corporate bankruptcy. 73 c. Systemic differences between the states under consideration: specialized courts and the predictability of litigation outcomes and the application of law &#8203; 61.&#160;&#160;&#160;Beyond black letter doctrines of corporate governance law, states can differ in the predictability of how their courts apply that law. These differences, if significant, can affect a firm&#8217;s operations, its overall value, and the relative legal rights of its shareholders, directors, officers, and other stakeholders. 62.&#160;&#160;&#160;One potential difference between Texas and Delaware is judicial expertise. The Delaware Court of Chancery is an experienced and specialized corporate law court. It was the first of its kind in the nation and its expertise is often lauded as the main reason for Delaware&#8217;s success in attracting charters. While Texas does not currently have a similar court system, it is launching a specialized court in September&#160;2024. 74 This signals that Texas is committed to developing a similarly specialized business judiciary, but there is some uncertainty about how that project will unfold. The newness of the court may make it less predictable. On the other hand, the number of judges&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only two judges per judicial division in Texas as compared to seven judges on the Delaware Court of Chancery&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;may provide additional litigation predictability in Texas. 63.&#160;&#160;&#160;Beyond the judicial expertise, the structure of the law itself can affect predictability. Detailed statutory law tends to be more predictable in application than general equitable standards. In the remainder of this section, I discuss the ways in which the corporate governance regimes in Delaware and Texas differ along this dimension and how those differences may affect the predictability of litigation outcomes and the application of law in each state. Once again there is an extensive literature on the topic with regard to Delaware. I review that literature and then examine whether and how the Texas regime is likely to be more or less predictable than the Delaware regime. i. Delaware&#8217;s indeterminacy &#8203; 64.&#160;&#160;&#160;Within the academic literature on Delaware&#8217;s primacy in the market for corporate charters is an extensive discussion about the predictability and determinacy of Delaware corporate law. A consensus has emerged that Delaware corporate law is largely indeterminate and often unpredictable. This results because the law is applied largely through case-specific standards that rely on the ex post judgment of the judges on the Delaware Court of Chancery. This view has persisted over time and is largely shared by both critics and defenders of the value of Delaware incorporation and by most of the Delaware judges who have written on the topic. The following paragraphs present a sampling of this view from scholars and judges on both sides of the Delaware debate. &#8203; 70 Daines (2002). 71 See Ann Lipton, Inside Out (or, One State to Rule them All): New Challenges to the Internal Affairs Doctrine , 58 Wake Forest L.

Delaware precedents, however, are narrow for another reason as well. Delaware judges intend their decisions to be interpreted narrowly. Delaware opinions thus frequently include admonitions that they are dependent on a particular set of facts and regularly shy away from announcing general rules that do not leave any escape hatch. &#8230; Because the law is standard based and there is uncertainty about which test applies, litigation may ensue even absent factual disputes. And because the precedents are narrow, uncertainties are slowly resolved.&#8221; 79 68.&#160;&#160;&#160;Former Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo Strine authored a response to Kahan and Kamar arguing in favor of Delaware&#8217;s indeterminacy: &#8220;I advance the proposition that much of Delaware corporate law&#8217;s indeterminacy and litigation intensiveness is an unavoidable consequence of the flexibility of the Delaware Model, which leaves room for economically useful innovation and creativity.&#8221; 80 69.&#160;&#160;&#160;Professors Carney and Shepherd have countered that indeterminacy is the great flaw of Delaware law. They note a high level of reversal rate for decisions of the Delaware Court of Chancery. 81 They argue that the quality of rulings is immaterial to the cost imposed by uncertainty, explaining, &#8220;The important observation here is not that the rules are difficult to discern once announced, but that new rules have been announced with remarkable regularity.&#8221; 82 They point out that this uncertainty increases transaction costs. 83 70.&#160;&#160;&#160;This is just a small sampling of the extensive literature reflecting the view that Delaware law is indeterminate. To be clear, indeterminacy is separate from quality of decisions. It may be that Delaware law is responsive to changing dynamics in corporate law. This may mean that the courts are generally reaching the &#8220;right&#8221; &#8203; 75 Jill E.

The defenders of Delaware would laud this as a sign that the law is flexible and responsive. The critics would complain that the cost of the &#8220;right&#8221; rule in this context is the lack of direction for those making the decisions. As former Chancellor Allen put it, As a general matter, those who must shape their conduct to conform to the dictates of statutory law should be able to satisfy such requirements by satisfying the literal demands of the law rather than being required to guess about the nature and extent of some broader or different restriction at the risk of an ex post facto determination of error. 84 71.&#160;&#160;&#160;In a separate speech, former Chancellor Allen noted the ambiguity in Delaware law and summarized the problem in valuing that ambiguity this way: That ambiguity is capable of causing either a net cost (i.e., adding more certainty than is optimum to the governance system) or a net benefit. Whether the corporate law is at one end of this spectrum of economic effects or the other depends on the way the fiduciary duty is enforced. Unfortunately, there is no science currently available that permits the precise measurement of these cross-cutting efficiency effects in general (i.e., systemically) or in a particular firm. Thus, I assert that, at its most sophisticated level, corporation law is presently an artistic enterprise. 85 72.&#160;&#160;&#160;Ultimately, whether indeterminacy is a feature or a bug of the Delaware corporate governance regime is a question that echoes the fundamental choice in all of law between rules and standards. 86 I have summarized this debate in my prior work this way: Standards, on the other hand, are adjudicated after the fact. As a result, lawmakers avoid high up-front design costs. Moreover, when applied after the fact, standards can be [if judges are highly competent] precisely tailored or calibrated to a specific context as it actually arose. But they also generate ex ante uncertainty because regulated actors do not know up front whether their behavior will be deemed by the adjudicator to comply with the standard. 87 73.&#160;&#160;&#160;Consistent with this trade-off, proponents of indeterminacy argue that it allows the courts to account for new developments with each case. Critics suggest that it leads to uncertainty and imposes costs on directors and officers. It is worth noting that the costs of standards might fall disproportionally on certain firms. Specifically, standards will impose more uncertainty on large firms that are more likely to be targeted for litigation and on innovative firms that are more likely to engage in novel transactions that do not fit the exact pattern of previously litigated cases. 74.&#160;&#160;&#160;While the consensus view is that Delaware law is&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for better or worse&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;indeterminate, there are a few dissenters. For example, Professor Romano suggested in 2001 that &#8220;Delaware law is more predictable and certain than that of any other state.&#8221; 88 Professor Dammann argued in 2013 that English and German corporate law were no less indeterminate than Delaware law. 89 Former Chancellor Chandler has similarly argued that there is no empirical &#8203; 84 Speiser v.

Musk as having no basis and noting that &#8220;judicial pricing of compensation packages is unmoored in standards that would make any exercise of discretion reviewable in any coherent and consistent way.&#8221; 94 &#8203; &#8226; &#8220; Enlarging the definition of &#8220;controlling stockholders&#8221; to include persons having little or no share voting power.&#8221; 95 In making this argument they cited the Chancery Court&#8217;s decision in In re Tesla Motors, Inc. S&#8217;holder Litig. , 96 as the prime illustration. &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;Insufficiently distinguishing between transactions involving classic self dealing and transactions in which a fiduciary (whether a director or controlling stockholder) receives an additional benefit only because of being differently situated, thereby extending entire fairness review to a context where it does not fit.&#8221; 97 &#8203; &#8226; Adopting a demand futility test that is inconsistent with liability standards for controlling shareholders, with the result that the law &#8220;rest[s] on incoherent premises about independent directors.&#8221; 98 &#8203; 76.&#160;&#160;&#160;In making these observations, the authors also flagged the persisting uncertainty about controlling shareholder liability in Delaware, given that the Delaware Supreme Court has failed to answer the question: &#8220;outside of the going private context, what cleansing techniques will change that initial standard from entire fairness to business judgment review?&#8221; 99 These observations by two former Justices of the Delaware Supreme Court (who &#8203; 90 William Chandler, III, &amp; Anthony A.

The unknowns of Texas &#8203; 77.&#160;&#160;&#160;It is difficult to say whether Texas corporate law will be more or less predictable than Delaware. Texas has a much less developed body of case law. On the one hand, this creates uncertainty about outcomes. On the other, Delaware&#8217;s indeterminacy persists despite its extensive case law. 78.&#160;&#160;&#160;One view is that Delaware&#8217;s indeterminacy arises because of the Delaware General Corporate Law&#8217;s reliance on case-specific standards. Thus, one would expect less indeterminacy in jurisdictions with more detailed statutory guidance. As one article noted in comparing Minnesota and Delaware: Even though the Delaware case law is extensive, Minnesota&#8217;s statutory codification creates more certainty than the Delaware case law because of (a)&#160;internal ambiguities in many of the Delaware judicial decisions; (b)&#160;apparent inconsistencies among certain contemporaneously decided Delaware cases; (c)&#160;divergence of certain decisions with the letter of, and apparent policy behind, the Delaware statute; and (d)&#160;tendency of the Delaware courts to reverse or ignore precedent and upset expectations. 101 79.&#160;&#160;&#160;A similar argument could be made in favor of certainty in Texas. For example, Delaware&#8217;s corporate law statute uses very broad language in describing the potential safe harbors for interested directors. Section&#160;144 of the DGCL notes that such interested transactions are not void or voidable &#8220;solely for this reason&#8221; if the transaction is approved by a vote of disinterested directors or shareholders. 102 The statute does not make explicit whether this provision creates a safe harbor or does something else. It leaves the specifics to the courts, which have concluded, &#8220;Our case law interpreting Section&#160;144(a)(1) is murky at best.&#8221; 103 80. In contrast, Texas&#8217;s analogous provisions conclude with this language: &#8203; If at least one of the conditions&#8230;is satisfied, neither the corporation nor any of the corporation&#8217;s shareholders will have a cause of action against any of the persons described by Subsection (a)&#160;for breach of duty. 104 81.&#160;&#160;&#160;The clarity of this statutory language would suggest more predictable litigation outcomes on this issue in Texas than in Delaware. &#8203; 100 Similar evidence of the indeterminacy of Delaware law over the&#160;years can be found in the language that sitting judges have used in describing Delaware law on various questions.

For example, the case law in Texas on oversight liability (Caremark claims), 105 judicial review of controlling shareholder transactions, 106 and the application of intermediate scrutiny for takeover defenses 107 is not well-developed. 83.&#160;&#160;&#160;The exact standard of liability and level of judicial review in these contexts is not yet known. For example, in the context of a controlling shareholder of closely held corporations, Texas has rejected an independent cause for shareholder oppression, but it has also suggested that minority shareholders could protect their rights through other causes of action including one for breach of fiduciary duties owed to the corporation. 108 Without more case law on claims against controlling shareholders of publicly held corporations, there is some uncertainty in Texas. It is worth noting, however, that Delaware case law on controlling shareholder transactions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;while much more developed&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;still does not provide a definitive answer to key questions such as who qualifies as a controlling shareholder, what qualifies as a controlling shareholder conflict, the level of judicial review for controlling shareholder transactions outside of the merger context, 109 and the operation of safe harbors for those transactions. 110 &#8203; 105 See In re Life Partners Holding Inc , No. DR-11-CV-43-AM, 2015 WL 8523103 at *11 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 9, 2015). 106 See Ritchie v. Rupe , 443 S.W.3d 856 (Tex. 2014); Matter of Estate of Poe , 648 S.W. 3d 277 (Tex. 2022); Riebe v. Nat&#8217;l Loan Inv., L.P., 828 F. Supp 453 (N.D.

Feb. 26, 2019) (noting the lack of definitive authority in Texas on the question). 108 Ritchie , 443 S.W.3d at 882. 109 After I completed the initial draft of this report, the Delaware Supreme Court issued an opinion in In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative Litigation , which addresses the scope of judicial review for controlling shareholder transactions. In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative Litig., No. 368, 2022, 2024 WL 1449815 (Del. Apr. 4, 2024). In its opinion, the Court rejects arguments for limiting the scope of entire fairness review. While the court leaves the door open for further revisions and uncertainty, see id. at * 15 (&#8220;We note, however, that these points have long been subject to debate and are thus not something to be decided in this appeal on the record before us.&#8221;), it embraces a rule that seems to cover all transactions where the controlling shareholder receives a non-ratable benefit. I say &#8220;seems&#8221; because such a rule taken literally would be impossible to implement. With a controlling shareholder who is also an officer, the Court&#8217;s rule would require either a shareholder vote or judicial review for such mundane transactions as approving vacation time, remodeling one&#8217;s office, reimbursing a working meal, or even getting a cup of coffee at work. All of these transactions provide a benefit to the controlling shareholder that are not realized by the other shareholders. The last example is obviously absurd, and no court of equity would entertain such a claim. But that shows that a line still remains to be drawn in defining the scope of the doctrine. The Court at one point suggests that for &#8220;ordinary course transactions such as compensation decisions and intercompany agreements,&#8221; the company could look to Rule&#160;23.1 and &#8220;our demand review precedent&#8221; for insulation against frivolous litigation. Id. at *1. This is the exact regime of review that Professor Hamermesh and former Justices Jacobs and Strine characterized as &#8220;rest[ing] on incoherent premises about independent directors.&#8221; Hamermesh, et al. (2022) at 326. The Delaware Court responds, &#8220;Admittedly, there is a tension in our law in these contexts.&#8221; In re Match Group at *16. 110 See above at note 99. &#160; 19 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 84.&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, a recent major Delaware Supreme Court case on Caremark liability was viewed by many as a surprise. Indeed, in that case, the Delaware Court of Chancery had ruled that the plaintiff&#8217;s case &#8220;is not a valid theory under&#8230; Caremark.&#8221; 111 It was in reversing that ruling that the Delaware Supreme Court announced the now controlling standard for Caremark claims. 112 Litigants are still figuring out the full extent of that standard. 113 85.&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, it is worth noting that when faced with uncertainty, Texas courts have often looked to Delaware precedent as a guide. And specifically in the context of Caremark claims and Unocal defenses, federal courts have predicted that Texas courts will follow Delaware authority. 114 &#8203; 111 Marchand v. Barnhill , C.A. No. 2017-0586-JRS, 2018 WL 4657159, at *18 (Del. Ch. Sept. 27, 2018), rev&#8217;d , 212 A.3d 805 (Del. 2019); See In re Life Partners , 2015 WL 8523103 at *11 (W.D. Tex. 2015) (predicting that Texas would follow Delaware law on Caremark claims). 112 Marchand v. Barnhill , 212 A.3d 805 (Del. 2019). 113 Other recent cases provide examples of Delaware&#8217;s continuing trend of expanding the scope of claims that meet the hurdle of stating a viable Caremark claim. See, for example, Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters&#8217; Pension Tr. Fund v. Walton , No. 2021-0827-JTL, 2023 WL 3093500 (Del. Ch. Apr. 26, 2023) (denying Rule&#160;23.1 motion to dismiss Caremark and Massey claims); In re McDonald&#8217;s Corp. Stockholder Derivative Litig., 289 A.3d 343 (Del. Ch. 2023) (denying Rule&#160;12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Caremark claims against officer). This expansion comes as a particular surprise in light of the Delaware courts&#8217; previous insistences that Caremark claims &#8220;were possibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.&#8221; Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorporation v. Ritter , 911 A.2d 362, 372 (Del. 2006) (quoting In re Caremark Int&#8217;l Inc. Deriv.

Corp. , 2019 WL 937195, at *7 (&#8220;Accordingly, this Court concludes that Texas courts would adopt Delaware fiduciary law in the merger context and applies Delaware law in its analysis.&#8221;). &#160; 20 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; d. Differences in specific features of the corporate governance regimes in the states under consideration &#8203; 86.&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of the convergence discussed above, the bulk of corporate law is the same or equivalent across jurisdiction in the United States. Between Texas and Delaware, the business judgment rule, the corporate opportunities doctrine, and the rules for director exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of fees are the same or equivalent. 87.&#160;&#160;&#160;There are, however, some areas of law where the laws of the two states differ. Sometimes these differences are merely in the way that each state articulates its rules, with the substance remaining the same. In this section of the report, I examine a series of potential differences between Texas and Delaware law identifying where the differences are real, where they are marginal, and where they are apparent only. i. Baseline duties &#8203; 88.&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware corporate governance law imposes two duties on the directors and officers of a corporation: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. 115 89.&#160;&#160;&#160;Texas law imposes three duties on directors and officers: &#8220;namely, the duties of obedience, loyalty, and due care.&#8221; 116 The addition of the duty of obedience in Texas is a difference in form only. This duty requires that directors and officers &#8220;avoid committing ultra vires acts.&#8221; 117 The same obligation to avoid taking unauthorized actions is incumbent on directors and officers in Delaware. 90.&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Texas cases also refer to other duties, such as the duty of candor. 118 It is unclear whether this is an independent duty or a subset of the duties of loyalty and care. In any event, the same duty of candor and disclosure exists under the duty of loyalty in Delaware. 119 91.&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that while the nomenclature differs, the baseline fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers are the same in Texas and in Delaware. ii. Officer exculpation in Delaware but not Texas &#8203; 92.&#160;&#160;&#160;Section&#160;102(b)(7) of the DGCL was amended in 2022 to allow corporations to include provisions in their certificate of incorporation exculpating the liability of officers for monetary damages for breach of the fiduciary duty of care. 120 Previously, the statute had only allowed for the exculpation of director liability. The amendment, however, carved out actions against officers &#8220;by or in the right of the corporation&#8221; as non-exculpable. 121 This carve out limits the exculpation of officers to direct shareholder claims for breaches of the duty of care. 122 93.&#160;&#160;&#160;While section 7.001 of the TBOC provides for similar exculpation of director liability, it does not allow for the exculpation of officers. As a result, Texas law provides slightly broader shareholder litigation rights than Delaware when it comes to bringing direct duty of care claims against officers. &#8203; 115 Stone ex rel.

Constituency statute &#8203; 94.&#160;&#160;&#160;Texas, along with thirty-one other states (as of 2021), 123 has adopted a constituency statute that explicitly allows directors and officers to consider non-shareholder constituencies in performing their duties. 124 This statute allows directors to consider long- and short-term interests of shareholders and provides that directors and officers may &#8220;consider[&#8199;], approv[e], or tak[e] action that promotes or has the effect of promoting a social, charitable, or environmental purpose.&#8221; 125 Texas&#8217;s statute is one of only two constituency statutes (the other being Arizona&#8217;s) that specifically mention the environment. 126 95.&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware does not have a constituency statute. 96.&#160;&#160;&#160;The question of corporate purpose&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;sometimes framed as one of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or considering Environmental, Social, and Governance factors (ESG)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is the subject of a hotly contested debate within corporate law scholarship and the more general public discourse. These statutes have large symbolic and expressive effects and are intended to signal that corporations can (and perhaps should) consider purposes and constituencies beyond mere shareholder profit maximization. 97.&#160;&#160;&#160;For a corporation with mission-driven purpose, incorporating in a state with a constituency statute can send an important message to employees, customers, and other stakeholders and can enhance the corporation&#8217;s credibility with regard to that mission. Incorporation in a state&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;like Delaware&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whose prominent judges have disavowed the ability of directors to consider non-profit-maximizing goals, 127 can undermine a statement of a corporate social mission. 128 98.&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, the effect of constituency statutes on actual liability and litigation rights is negligible, if it exists at all. To start with, most commentators view Delaware law as permissive of corporations who pursue the benefit of non-shareholder constituencies. 129 And the overwhelming majority of cases in Delaware grant broad discretion to directors in considering non-shareholder interests. In most cases, the directors&#8217; broad discretion under the business judgment rule coupled with the long-term interest of shareholders will be enough to eliminate a litigable difference between pursuing shareholder and non-shareholder interests. As Vice Chancellor Will recently noted in an interview with Bloomberg, The goal of the board at the end of the day should be to create long-term value for the stockholders. &#8230; And if you&#8217;re thinking about creating long-term value, you want to have happy employees, you want to have engaged &#8203; 123 See Lucian Bebchuk, Kobi Kastiel, Roberto Tallarita, For Whom Corporate Leaders Bargain , 94 S.

Kim notes that constituency statutes that &#8220;explicitly permit [directors] to also consider societal impacts&#8221; can foster prosocial corporate missions by shaping stakeholder expectations &#8220;over the proper role of business in society.&#8221; Id. She contrasts those statutes to Delaware law, which she argues express a norm of exclusive profit maximization. Id. 129 See id. at n. 9 (collecting a long list of sources, or &#8220;deniers,&#8221; who believe Delaware law permits the pursuit of non-shareholder interests). &#160; 22 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; customers, you want to have a sustainable business from an environmental standpoint, and so you need to be giving some weight to these different stakeholder interests, depending on your industry, in order to exercise your fiduciary duties anyway. 130 99.&#160;&#160;&#160;It is also notable that many Delaware corporations have publicly stated a pursuit of non-shareholder purposes and have done so without facing any legal consequences or changing their bylaws or charters. 131 100.&#160;&#160;&#160;The only contexts in which the Delaware courts have significantly invoked the exclusive duty to shareholders are the narrow context of Revlon transactions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;when the firm is being sold in a transaction that will cash out shareholders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the context of extreme affirmative actions to disenfranchise shareholders or minority directors. 132 Recent empirical work further suggests that there is little or no effect even in the Revlon context. 133 iv. Duties in the Revlon Context &#8203; 101.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220; Revlon duties,&#8221; arise from the duties of care and loyalty in a certain set of circumstances. In those circumstances, Delaware case law construes director and officer duties as to require an attempt to achieve the highest and best price in a cash-out transaction. 20 134 The scope of cases in which Revlon duties apply is narrow and not clearly demarcated. 135 The prototypical context is an all-cash sale of a firm owned by disperse shareholders. Revlon also applies to stock-for-stock transactions that relegate shareholders of a dispersely owned firm to a minority position in a majority-controlled firm. Revlon does not apply to a stock-for-stock merger between two firms that are owned by disperse shareholders. 102.&#160;&#160;&#160;When Revlon does not apply, Delaware law allows directors and officers to proactively oppose transactions that are inconsistent with their view of the long-term interest of the corporation. 136 103.&#160;&#160;&#160;Texas law more clearly provides by statute that directors and officers may consider &#8220;the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation and the stockholders of the corporation, including the possibility that those interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation.&#8221; 137 104.&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that Texas and Delaware law treat most transaction in the same way allowing directors and officers to consider long-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders. There is, however, a small category of takeover cases where the focus of director duties will be different in Delaware and Texas. v. Duty to shareholders &#8203; 105.&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent Texas cases have emphasized that a &#8220;corporate officer or director&#8217;s duty is to the corporation and its shareholders collectively, not any individual shareholder or subgroup of shareholders, even if that subgroup &#8203; 130 Clare Hudson, Delaware Judge Faces New Era of Politically Charged ESG Cases , (Dec. 13, 2023) available at https:// &#8203; news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/delaware-judge-faces-new-era-of-politically - charged-esg-cases (quoting Vice Chancellor Lori Will). 131 See Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation , Bus.

(internal quotations omitted). 137 TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401(b). &#160; 23 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; represents a majority of the ownership.&#8221; 138 This statement is similar to several pronouncements of the Delaware courts that director and officer fiduciary duties run to the corporation and the collective shareholders. 139 106.&#160;&#160;&#160;One might read some Texas cases as going further and eliminating the duty to shareholders altogether. This is an erroneous reading given the clear statement of the Supreme Court of Texas that the duty runs &#8220;to the shareholders collectively&#8221; and given Texas&#8217;s statutory provisions entitling directors to consider &#8220;the long-term and short-term interests of the corporation and the shareholders of the corporation. &#8221; 140 But even if it were a correct reading, it would not have a meaningful impact on liability. Indeed, the idea that directors owe duties to shareholders is a commonly misunderstood concept&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in Delaware and elsewhere&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that provides little real guidance. As noted above, the notion has little impact on actual liability and litigation rights. 141 And it often confuses the notion of shareholder value (which is maximized by increasing the long-term value of the corporation) and shareholder interests (which no corporate law requires directors to consider). Examining this confusion, Professors Baird and Henderson have characterized the &#8220;duty to shareholders&#8221; as &#8220;[a]n almost-right principle [that] invites sloppy thinking, vague generalities, and a general distortion of the otherwise sound ideas that lie close by.&#8221; 142 They further note, however, that, &#8220;[t]he notion that fiduciary duties are owed to shareholders has not yet generated seriously wrong-headed outcomes. (Among other things, the Delaware chancellors are generally too smart to let this happen.).&#8221; 143 107.&#160;&#160;&#160;One Texas case suggests that the lack of a duty to shareholders may be relevant in determining whether an action for a cash-out merger is direct or derivative. 144 If other courts follow that reasoning, it would create a procedural hurdle to litigants in Texas that does not always exist for litigants in Delaware in the narrow context of cash-out merger transactions. Note, however, that if these actions are duty of care claims brought against officers, Delaware allows for the full exculpation of those claims where Texas does not. 145 The result then is that the protection of shareholders in the context of cash-out mergers may be different in Texas and Delaware, with Delaware law definitively eliminating substantive liability in some cases and Texas law potentially imposing an additional procedural hurdle in some cases. &#8203; 138 Ritchie , 443 S.W.3d at 885. 139 The Delaware Court of Chancery court in Frederick Hsu Living Tr. v.

Demand regime for derivative litigation &#8203; 108.&#160;&#160;&#160;Texas corporate law, like Delaware corporate law, requires that shareholders make demand on the board of directors before initiating a derivative lawsuit. 146 Unlike Delaware, Texas does not excuse this demand requirement upon a showing of futility. Once a shareholder has made demand, the board has 90&#160;days to respond before a lawsuit can be filed. 109.&#160;&#160;&#160;The board&#8217;s response to demand must be determined by a majority of (1)&#160;&#8220;all independent and disinterested directors of the corporation,&#8221; &#8203;(2)&#160;a committee of independent and disinterested directors, or (3)&#160;a panel of &#8220;independent and disinterested individuals appointed by the court.&#8221; 147 110.&#160;&#160;&#160;If the shareholder brings suit despite demand having been rejected, the corporation can seek dismissal. The dismissal will be granted if the independent directors, committee, or panel &#8220;determines in good faith, after conducting a reasonable inquiry and based on factors the person or group considers appropriate under the circumstances, that continuation of the derivative proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation.&#8221; 148 111.&#160;&#160;&#160;The shareholder bringing a derivative action is entitled to discovery as to the independence of the directors, committee or panel, the good faith of their review, and the reasonableness of the procedures they followed. 149 112.&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware requires demand but will excuse the requirement when the shareholder can show that demand was futile. To succeed on an argument of futility, the shareholders must show that a majority of directors (i)&#160;&#8220;received a material personal benefit from the alleged misconduct;&#8221; &#8203;(ii)&#160;&#8220;face[&#8199;] a substantial likelihood of liability;&#8221; or (iii)&#160;&#8220;lack[&#8199;] independence from someone who received a material personal benefit&#8221; &#8230; or &#8220;who would face a substantial likelihood of liability.&#8221; 150 113.&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the litigants challenging demand refusal in Texas, &#8220;[i]n general, derivative plaintiffs [in Delaware] are not entitled to discovery in order to demonstrate demand futility.&#8221; 151 Instead, the shareholders are expected to pursue the necessary information through a books and records request under section 220 of the DGCL before initiating a derivative proceeding. 152 114.&#160;&#160;&#160;In Delaware, if a shareholder makes demand, the shareholder &#8220;tacitly acknowledges the absence of facts to support a finding of futility.&#8221; 153 115.&#160;&#160;&#160;While the Texas and Delaware procedures differ, both are designed to achieve the same goal: to have suits controlled by an independent board or committee of the board of directors. Both regimes anticipate that most cases will result in the board of directors controlling the decision to litigate and deal with those cases in the same manner, requiring demand. They differ in how they deal with the exceptional cases where the court will allow shareholders to wrest control from the board. 116.&#160;&#160;&#160;In Texas, the shareholder makes demand and then&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if there is reason to believe that the board was not independent in responding to that demand&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the shareholder can litigate the question of independence. In Delaware, the shareholder generally does not make demand and instead first litigates the question of whether the board is independent enough to be trusted in responding to a demand request. &#8203; 146 TBOC Ch. 21 Subchapter L. 147 TBOC &#167;21.554(a). 148 TBOC &#167;21.558(a). 149 TBOC &#167;21.556(a). 150 United Food and Com.

Buntrock , 571 A.2d 767, 775 (Del. 1990). &#160; 25 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 117.&#160;&#160;&#160;In either event, the litigation in these exceptional cases begins with the question of director independence. In Delaware, however, the shareholder plaintiff is limited in the available discovery on the question of independence. In Texas, the plaintiff is entitled to more discovery, but must first give the board the chance to respond to demand in the appropriate manner. 118.&#160;&#160;&#160;Notably in Texas, the shareholder is only prevented from pursuing litigation when there has been an independent review of the shareholder&#8217;s demand. Given that both states&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and the entire foundation of derivative litigation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;view independent board review as the ideal of corporate fiduciary litigation, Texas procedure to guarantee that review cannot and likely will not be viewed as reducing shareholder litigation rights. 119.&#160;&#160;&#160;In Delaware, if the shareholder makes demand in the hopes of achieving the ideal of independent review, the shareholder has given up any later objection that the board was conflicted in its review. Thus, a shareholder might make demand in the hopes that the board would comply with its duty to create an independent committee to review the case. If the board instead refuses the demand without creating that committee, the shareholder in Delaware has nonetheless conceded that demand is not futile. In contrast, a Texas shareholder could still challenge the board&#8217;s failure to appoint an independent committee in such a case. 120.&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of these dynamics, the universal demand requirement in Texas is more protective of shareholder litigation rights and more effective in promoting an independent board or committee review of derivative litigation than the regime in Delaware. vii. Jury trials 154 &#8203; 121.&#160;&#160;&#160;In Texas, civil litigants are entitled to demand a jury trial. 155 This right will exist in the Texas Business Courts. 156 122. There is no right to a jury trial in the Delaware Court of Chancery. &#8203; viii. Right to call a special meeting &#8203; 123.&#160;&#160;&#160;Texas requires that corporations provide shareholders the right to call a special meeting. The corporation can specify the&#160;percentage of voting shares required to invoke this right, but that requirement cannot exceed 50&#160;percent. 157 124. Delaware does not provide this protection to shareholders. &#8203; ix. Texas limitation on expanding the board &#8203; 125.&#160;&#160;&#160;Texas provides that if a board increases the number of directors, it may only fill two of the vacancies created by that increase between shareholder meetings. 158 This protects against board attempts to thwart takeovers or activist campaigns by expanding the board and appointing directors to fill the created vacancies. 126.&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware does not provide this protection to shareholders. V. Conclusions on Relevant Legal and Corporate Governance Considerations &#8203; a. There is no general discernible value premium or discount associated with Delaware, Texas, or any other state. &#8203; 127.&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite decades of searching, academics and other analysts have not been able to conclusively identify a change in corporation value (often referred to as a &#8220;Delaware premium&#8221; or &#8220;Delaware discount&#8221;) associated with &#8203; 154 The right to a jury trial in Texas does not increase the uncertainty of the law in Texas. As with all other jurisdictions in the United States, juries are tasked with deciding factual questions and not legal questions. Thus, legal uncertainties would be decided by the courts in these systems and would determine whether cases go to the jury at all. 155 Tex. Const. Art. 5. &#167;&#160;10; Tex R. Civ. P. 216. 156 Tex.

The existing literature strongly suggests that such premium is non-existent or unknowable. This should not be surprising. While corporate governance laws differ across states in some respects, there are more similarities than differences. For most states, and especially for the states under consideration here, the core duties of directors and officers and potential avenues of liability are substantially similar, even if the legal doctrines are sometimes stated differently. 128.&#160;&#160;&#160;The takeaway from any review of the literature on this topic is that one can draw no firm conclusion about the existence of a Delaware (or other state) premium or discount. 159 The literature is indeterminate. And given the incentives of academics and market actors to prove a definitive answer here and the difficulty of proving a negative, the most reasonable conclusion is that no discoverable premium exists. 129.&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, there is no convincing evidence of a Texas premium or discount, though the issue has not received anywhere near the same level of attention. Indeed, empirical studies on the value of incorporating in states other than Delaware and Nevada 160 are sparse. 161 b. Delaware law is indeterminate and legal outcomes are often unpredictable. But Texas law lacks a depth of court precedent on questions of corporate law. As a result, the relative predictability of corporate governance law in Texas and Delaware, and any effect of that relative predictability on shareholder value, is unknown. &#8203; 130.&#160;&#160;&#160;Delaware law is indeterminate and litigation intensive. As laid out above, indeterminacy has costs and benefits. Those costs are likely to be borne disproportionately by large and innovative companies. As a result, the indeterminacy of Delaware law is likely to impose costs on Tesla that reduce its value to shareholders. 131.&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, the determinacy of Texas law is not established. Texas has a more detailed statutory framework but lacks a depth of precedent. Moreover, Texas often follows the lead of Delaware in filling the gaps in its corporate law. In this way, Texas and Delaware law may be equivalently indeterminate with regard to certain areas of corporate law&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is likely true in the context of controlling shareholder litigation and Caremark liability. c. Certain features of Texas corporate governance law are likely to create a Tesla-specific benefit for the corporation and its shareholders associated with incorporating in Texas and a potential Tesla-specific cost for the corporation and its shareholders associated with incorporation in Delaware. &#8203; 132.&#160;&#160;&#160;There is value inherent in home-state incorporation, which may favor Texas incorporation for Tesla. This value derives from the potential improved access to and relationships with local government actors and regulators as well as improved relationships with local constituencies including employees and the communities in which Tesla carries on major operations. 133.&#160;&#160;&#160;There is also potential value created by the alignment of the Texas Business Organizations Code&#8217;s constituency provisions with Tesla&#8217;s unique corporate mission. Texas explicitly allows directors and officers to consider non-shareholder constituencies and purposes including environmental purposes. These constituency provisions are aligned with Tesla&#8217;s stated corporate mission &#8220;to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy.&#8221; 162 While constituency statutes do not affect liability, they have symbolic effects that can be valuable and add credibility when a corporation communicates its mission to its employees, customers, and other constituencies. 134.&#160;&#160;&#160;Additionally, Delaware&#8217;s indeterminacy and litigation intensive environment impose costs that are borne largely by large innovative corporations. This effect is exacerbated by the fact that Delaware has no cap on &#8203; 159 Mark J. Roe, Delaware&#8217;s Competition , 117 Harv. L. Rev. 588, 634 (2003) (&#8220;The debate is stalemated.&#8221;); Robert Anderson IV, The Delaware Trap , 91 S. Cal. Rev. 657, 666 (2018) (&#8220;Thus, there is no definitive evidence that Delaware law increases the value of companies, there is some evidence it does not matter, and there is little evidence that it decreases the value of companies.&#8221;). 160 As noted above, there is significant speculation that incorporation in Nevada may reduce shareholder value, but there is no conclusive study showing that. 161 The data for such studies would be unreliable given the smaller numbers and the strong selection toward home-state incorporation as an alternative to Delaware. 162 https://www.tesla.com/impact. &#160; 27 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; legal fees for plaintiffs in shareholder lawsuits (as opposed to Texas which limits fees based on a multiple and lodestar method). The end result is that large innovative companies like Tesla are likely to disproportionately be targeted for litigation (and likely by weaker and higher variance claims) in Delaware than in Texas. d. There is no material difference in aggregate substantive shareholder protections associated with incorporation in either Texas or Delaware. There is a potential increase in aggregate procedural shareholder protections in Texas. &#8203; 135.&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither state&#8217;s corporate governance regime provides more substantive protection to the general shareholders of large public companies. The differences between the corporate governance rules across states are often illusory, marginal, or offsetting. As detailed above, where there are substantive differences in the corporate governance laws in the two states under consideration by the committee, those differences are marginal. For example, Texas&#8217;s prohibition on exculpating officer liability is a substantive difference providing greater shareholder litigation rights in Texas. But that is a small difference limited to direct shareholder claims against officers for the breach of their fiduciary duty of care. In the aggregate, the bundles of substantive shareholder rights in the two states are substantially equivalent. 136.&#160;&#160;&#160;Some differences that might appear to make one state more protective of shareholders are superficial, exist in name only, or have de minimis effects. These perceived differences are best viewed as neutral in analyzing the value and protection each state affords to shareholders. Thus, while the following factors might support a claim that Texas is more protective of shareholder rights, I have treated them as neutral in comparing shareholder protections: Texas&#8217;s additional imposition of a duty of obedience and Texas case law suggesting the possibility of heightened scrutiny of directors adopting takeover defenses. Similarly, I have treated the following superficial factors, which might support a claim that Delaware is more protective of shareholder rights, as neutral: differences in the way courts in Texas and Delaware articulate the fiduciary duty owed to shareholders; Texas&#8217;s silence on an intermediate scrutiny for takeover defenses; Texas&#8217;s adoption of a constituency statute explicitly allowing directors to consider &#8220;social, charitable, or environmental purposes.&#8221; 163 137.&#160;&#160;&#160;It is important to note that uncertainty on any particular area of law does not enhance substantive shareholder protections. One might be tempted to observe that indeterminacy creates optionality for shareholder plaintiffs in filing lawsuits and then (incorrectly) conclude that such optionality protects substantive shareholder rights. For example, a shareholder plaintiff in Texas can argue that all takeover defenses are subject to review under the entire fairness standard. That argument is foreclosed by precedent in Delaware. On the other side, Texas&#8217;s statutory clarity on safe harbors might foreclose some arguments that plaintiffs might make in Delaware. One might assume that this optionality provides additional shareholder protection (in Texas in the first example and in Delaware in the second example). There are two flaws in this reasoning. First, litigation optionality always runs in both directions. The more indeterminate the law is on any issue, the more arguments are open to both parties . Second, and more importantly, litigation is only protective of shareholder rights if it creates incentives for better governance behavior. After all, shareholder rights are best protected when the shareholders do not have to bring a lawsuit to realize optimal governance. Clear procedural requirements, standards of review, and safe harbors protect shareholders precisely because they encourage directors to follow those procedures without the necessity of litigation. The same is not true of vague requirements and unresolved standards of review, which leave directors who are acting in good faith unsure about how to proceed. 164 &#8203; 163 TBOC &#167;&#160;21.401(e). 164 The Delaware Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in Kahn v. M &amp; F Worldwide Corporation that clear safe harbor rules &#8220;optimally protect[] the minority stockholders in controller buyouts&#8221; rests on this exact reasoning. 88 A.3d 635, 644 (Del. 2014). The Chancery court in that case made the point a little more colorfully: Uncertainty about the answer to a question that had not been put to our Supreme Court thus left controllers with an incentive system all of us who were adolescents (or are now parents or grandparents of adolescents) can understand. Assume you have a teenager with math and English assignments due Monday morning. If you tell the teenager that she can go to the movies Saturday night if she completes her math or English homework Saturday morning, she is unlikely to do both assignments Saturday morning. She is likely to do only that which is necessary to get to go to the movies&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; i.e., complete one of the assignments&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;leaving her parents and siblings to endure her stressful last-minute scramble to finish the other Sunday night. &#160; 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 138.&#160;&#160;&#160;With regard to procedural protections, I conclude that Texas is more protective of shareholder rights than Delaware. I base this on Texas shareholders&#8217; right to demand a jury trial, Texas shareholders&#8217; guaranteed right to call special meetings, Texas&#8217;s limitation on the board&#8217;s ability create and fill director vacancies, and certain features of the demand procedure in Texas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;including the ability to make demand without conceding arguments regarding director conflicts, the ability to get discovery about the independence of the demand board, and the lower threshold for bringing a derivative suit without first bringing an action to inspect books and records. These factors outweigh the protections one might identify on the Delaware side of the comparison, such as the option of demand excusal based on futility and the depth of Delaware case law on director liability for lack of oversight (Caremark claims). 139.&#160;&#160;&#160;As noted above, Texas&#8217;s derivative litigation regime more directly achieves the desired outcome of a review by an independent board or committee. Delaware law recognizes such a review as the most protective of shareholders, and only provides demand excusal when that is not procedurally available. But its tacit concession doctrine prevents shareholders from seeking that independent review without surrendering their litigation rights if such review is not provided. Universal demand guarantees that review and allows discovery to ensure that such review occurred. e. There is no non-ratable benefit for any directors, officers, or specific shareholders associated with incorporation in either Delaware or Texas &#8203; 140.&#160;&#160;&#160;Academics and litigants have suggested that the corporate governance laws of Nevada, by forcing shareholders &#8220;to give up the benefits of the duty of loyalty,&#8221; 165 favor controlling shareholders at the expense of other shareholders. 166 In its recent opinion in Palkon v. Maffei , the Delaware Court of Chancery concluded that this outcome could produce a &#8220;non-ratable&#8221; benefit for a controlling shareholder from reincorporation in Nevada. 167 In light of that analysis, the Committee should consider whether the choice of incorporating Tesla in any state creates similar non-ratable benefits for any director, officer, or particular shareholder (including Elon Musk). In my view, the question is equally relevant for a decision to stay in Delaware as it is for a decision to reincorporate in another state. As such, I provide the analysis for both Delaware and Texas. I conclude that there is no non-ratable benefit for any director, officer, or particular shareholder associated with a decision to remain incorporated in Delaware. Nor is there any such benefit associated with a decision to reincorporate in Texas. 141.&#160;&#160;&#160; Delaware. &#160;&#160;&#160;There are no features of Delaware corporate governance law such that remaining in Delaware creates a non-ratable benefit of the sort identified in Palkon v. Maffei . As compared to Texas, Delaware law limits shareholder litigation rights in several aspects. Most notably: &#8226; Delaware incorporation coupled with an exclusive forum selection provision eliminates shareholder rights to a jury trial. &#8203; &#8226; Delaware incorporation imposes burdens on shareholders in bringing derivative actions by eliminating their ability to make demand without conceding director independence, reducing their ability to get discovery about the independence of the demand board, and imposing a requirement of pre-filing books and records inspection on derivative plaintiffs. &#8203; 142. One might argue that each of these impositions creates non-ratable benefits for directors from deciding to remain in Delaware. Conventional wisdom is that plaintiffs do better with jury trials. While this view has not been confirmed, survey evidence does show that plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers tend to prefer jury trials to bench trials. 168 One could argue, then, that director defendants might benefit from a system that eliminates the right of a plaintiff to demand a jury. Such a benefit would, however, be likely to fall under the same procedural umbrella as exclusive forum provisions about which the Delaware Court of Chancery in Palkon v. Maffei concluded the following: &#8203; In re MFW Shareholders Litig., 67 A.3d 496, 500-01 (Del. Ch. 2013). 165 See Palkon , 2024 WL 67820, Verified Complaint at par. 6. 166 See above at notes 61-62. 167 Palkon, 2024 WL 678204 at *19. 168 Shari Seidman Diamond, Reasons for the Disappearing Jury Trial: Perspectives from Attorneys and Judges , 81 La. L. Rev. 120, 138-39 (2020). There is a robust body of legal scholarship arguing that civil jury trials provide special protections to litigants in other contexts. &#160; 29 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The bylaw only changes the forum, not the law or the fiduciaries&#8217; litigation exposure. To the extent that plaintiffs might be able to secure greater recoveries in other forums, that is not due to differences in substantive law, but rather the increased volatility that results when courts apply law with which they are less familiar. 169 143.&#160;&#160;&#160;The same reasoning would apply to jury trials. The difference is not one related to substantive law. 144.&#160;&#160;&#160;The altered rights with regard to derivative litigation are a closer call. Delaware&#8217;s forced concession that accompanies demand and the curtailed discovery with regard to director independence could be viewed as non-ratable benefits to any directors who might later be defendants in derivative actions. The counter argument is that these are non-substantive rights affecting litigation procedures without changing underlying duties that directors owe or materially altering the directors&#8217; litigation exposure. 170 And, as a practical matter, it is extremely unlikely that any Delaware court would find that Delaware&#8217;s derivative litigation requirements create a non-ratable benefit for directors who fear future lawsuits. To do so would open a floodgate suggesting a fiduciary duty among all corporations in Delaware to consider reincorporating elsewhere. 145.&#160;&#160;&#160; Texas. &#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, there are no features of Texas corporate governance law that create non-ratable benefits for any directors, officers, or specific shareholders. Texas corporate law does not have any feature potentially reducing liability similar to the sort identified in Palkon v. Maffei . There is some uncertainty in Texas case law about the exact procedures and mechanisms for enforcing shareholder rights in some contexts, such as controlling shareholder litigation. But the controlling precedent makes clear the Texas courts&#8217; intent to protect minority shareholder rights through various causes of action. The uncertainty appears to be only in the exact forms and procedural mechanism that will control those causes of action. Such uncertainty does not eliminate any liability of directors, officers, or controlling shareholders such that they would receive a non-ratable benefit by reincorporating into Texas. 146.&#160;&#160;&#160;One might argue that Texas&#8217;s universal demand requirement imposes a burden on derivative litigation that results in non-ratable benefits to any directors who might later be defendants in derivative actions. This argument is likely to fail. Just like Delaware&#8217;s forced concession rule and demand-discovery limitations, the universal demand requirement is best viewed as a non-substantive procedural matter that does not change the directors&#8217; underlying duties or materially alter their litigation exposure. 171 147.&#160;&#160;&#160;As noted above, the effect of a universal demand requirement is that suits will be reviewed by an independent committee of the board of directors. Importantly, this is the same effect that occurs under Delaware law when a company expands its board of directors to include additional independent directors to review conflicted transactions or demand requests. As with universal demand, the addition of independent directors guaranties independent review and eliminates the plaintiffs&#8217; ability to proceed with litigation. The Delaware Court of Chancery has identified such an approach as appropriate &#8220;to remove the taint&#8221; of self-interest and noted that its appropriateness would be &#8220;obvious to &#8230; sophisticated lawyers.&#8221; 172 148.&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, it is extremely unlikely that any Delaware court would find that any state&#8217;s particular derivative litigation requirements create a non-ratable benefit for directors who fear future lawsuits. Delaware has a unique demand regime and the Model Business Corporations Act and at least 23 states have adopted universal demand regimes. For a Delaware court to declare that universal demand creates a non-ratable benefit for directors would be to imply a conflict in almost every decision to reincorporate outside of Delaware. &#8203; Anthony J.

If the board of directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed &#160; G-9 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section&#160;213 of the DGCL and this Section&#160;2.11 at the adjourned meeting. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60&#160;days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 2.12&#160;&#160;&#160;PROXIES Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three&#160;years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section&#160;212 of the DGCL. A written proxy may be in the form of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the person. Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the board of directors. 2.13&#160;&#160;&#160;LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10&#160;days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10&#160;days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date. The stockholder list shall be arranged in alphabetical order and show the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10&#160;days prior to the meeting (i)&#160;on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)&#160;during ordinary business hours, at the corporation&#8217;s principal place of business. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. 2.14&#160;&#160;&#160;INSPECTORS OF ELECTION Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1)&#160;or three (3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder&#8217;s proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed and designated shall (i)&#160;ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each share, (ii)&#160;determine the shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii)&#160;count all votes and ballots, (iv)&#160;determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v)&#160;certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such inspector or inspectors&#8217; count of all votes and ballots. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the corporation, the inspector or inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. If there &#160; G-10 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#160; are three (3)&#160;inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. 2.15&#160;&#160;&#160;PROXY ACCESS (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;Whenever the board of directors solicits proxies with respect to the election of directors at an annual meeting, subject to the provisions of this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation shall include in its proxy statement for such annual meeting, in addition to any persons nominated for election by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the &#8220; Stockholder Nominee &#8221;) to the board of directors by an Eligible Stockholder (as defined in Section&#160;2.15(iv)) that expressly elects at the time of providing the notice required by this Section&#160;2.15 to have such nominee included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15. For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, the &#8220; Required Information &#8221; that the corporation will include in its proxy statement is (A)&#160;the information provided to the secretary of the corporation concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that is required to be disclosed in the corporation&#8217;s proxy statement pursuant to Section&#160;14 of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (B)&#160;if the Eligible Stockholder so elects, a Supporting Statement (as defined in Section&#160;2.15(viii)). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section&#160;2.15 shall limit the corporation&#8217;s ability to solicit against any Stockholder Nominee or include in its proxy materials the corporation&#8217;s own statements or other information relating to any Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, including any information provided to the corporation pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15. Subject to the provisions of this Section&#160;2.15, the name of any Stockholder Nominee included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy statement for an annual meeting shall also be set forth on the form of proxy distributed by the corporation in connection with such annual meeting. (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by an Eligible Stockholder pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, the Eligible Stockholder must have given timely notice of such nomination (the &#8220; Notice of Proxy Access Nomination &#8221;) in proper written form to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must be delivered to or be mailed and received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 120&#160;days nor more than 150&#160;days prior to the first anniversary of the date that the corporation first distributed its proxy statement to stockholders for the immediately preceding annual meeting. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Notice of Proxy Access Nomination pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15. (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;The maximum number of Stockholder Nominees nominated by all Eligible Stockholders that will be included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting shall not exceed the greater of (A)&#160;two or (B)&#160;20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Notice of Proxy Access Nomination may be delivered pursuant to and in accordance with this Section&#160;2.15 (the &#8220; Final Proxy Access Nomination Date &#8221;) or, if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below 20% (such greater number, as it may be adjusted pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, the &#8220; Permitted Number &#8221;). In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the board of directors after the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date but before the date of the annual meeting and the board of directors resolves to reduce the size of the board of directors in connection therewith, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. For purposes of determining when the Permitted Number has been reached, each of the following persons shall be counted as one of the Stockholder Nominees: (A)&#160;any individual nominated by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 whose nomination is subsequently withdrawn, (B)&#160;any individual nominated by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 whom the board of directors decides to nominate for election to the board of directors and (C)&#160;any director in office as of the Final Proxy Access Nomination Date who was included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials as a Stockholder Nominee for either of the two preceding annual meetings (including any individual counted as a Stockholder Nominee pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (B)) and whom the board of directors decides to nominate for re-election to the board of directors. Any Eligible Stockholder submitting more than one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 shall rank such Stockholder Nominees based on the order in which the Eligible Stockholder desires such Stockholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials in the event that the total number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 exceeds the Permitted &#160; G-11 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Number. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 exceeds the Permitted Number, the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section&#160;2.15 from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of capital stock of the corporation each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in its Notice of Proxy Access Nomination. If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section&#160;2.15 from each Eligible Stockholder has been selected, then the next highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Section&#160;2.15 from each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials, and this process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation shall not be required to include any Stockholder Nominees in its proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 for any meeting of stockholders for which the secretary of the corporation receives notice (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) that a stockholder intends to nominate one or more persons for election to the board of directors pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees set forth in Section&#160;2.4. (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;An &#8220; Eligible Stockholder &#8221; is a stockholder or group of no more than 20 stockholders (counting as one stockholder, for this purpose, any two or more funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group (as defined below)) that (A)&#160;has owned (as defined in Section&#160;2.15(v)) continuously for at least three&#160;years (the &#8220; Minimum Holding Period &#8221;) a number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that represents at least 3% of the corporation&#8217;s outstanding capital stock as of the date the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation in accordance with this Section&#160;2.15 (the &#8220; Required Shares &#8221;), (B)&#160;continues to own the Required Shares through the date of the annual meeting and (C)&#160;satisfies all other requirements of, and complies with all applicable procedures set forth in, this Section&#160;2.15. A &#8220; Qualifying Fund&#160;Group &#8221; is a group of two or more funds that are (A)&#160;under common management and investment control, (B)&#160;under common management and funded primarily by the same employer or (C)&#160;a &#8220;group of investment companies&#8221; as such term is defined in Section&#160;13(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Whenever the Eligible Stockholder consists of a group of stockholders (including a group of funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group), (A)&#160;each provision in this Section&#160;2.15 that requires the Eligible Stockholder to provide any written statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments or to meet any other conditions shall be deemed to require each stockholder (including each individual fund) that is a member of such group to provide such statements, representations, undertakings, agreements or other instruments and to meet such other conditions (except that the members of such group may aggregate the shares that each member has owned continuously for the Minimum Holding Period in order to meet the 3% ownership requirement of the &#8220;Required Shares&#8221; definition) and (B)a breach of any obligation, agreement or representation under this Section&#160;2.15 by any member of such group shall be deemed a breach by the Eligible Stockholder. No person may be a member of more than one group of stockholders constituting an Eligible Stockholder with respect to any annual meeting. (v)&#160;&#160;&#160;For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, an Eligible Stockholder shall be deemed to &#8220; own &#8221; only those outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation as to which the stockholder possesses both (A)&#160;the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (B)&#160;the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit from and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A)&#160;and (B)&#160;shall not include any shares (1)&#160;sold by such stockholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2)&#160;borrowed by such stockholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or (3)&#160;subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar instrument or agreement entered into by such stockholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares of outstanding capital stock of the corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (x)&#160;reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and/or (y)&#160;hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree any gain or loss realized or realizable from maintaining the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or affiliate. For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, a stockholder shall &#8220;own&#8221; shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder&#8217;s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any &#160; G-12 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; period in which (A)&#160;the stockholder has loaned such shares; provided that the stockholder has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days&#8217; notice and includes in its Notice of Proxy Access Nomination an agreement that it (1)&#160;will promptly recall such loaned shares upon being notified that any of its Stockholder Nominees will be included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials and (2)&#160;will continue to hold such recalled shares through the date of the annual meeting or (B)&#160;the stockholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is revocable at any time by the stockholder. The terms &#8220;owned,&#8221; &#8220;owning&#8221; and other variations of the word &#8220;own&#8221; shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation are &#8220;owned&#8221; for these purposes shall be determined by the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof). For purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, the term &#8220; affiliate &#8221; or &#8220; affiliates &#8221; shall have the meaning ascribed thereto under the General Rules and Regulations under the 1934 Act. (vi)&#160;&#160;&#160;To be in proper written form for purposes of this Section&#160;2.15, the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination must include or be accompanied by the following: (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;a written statement by the Eligible Stockholder certifying as to the number of shares it owns and has owned continuously for the Minimum Holding Period, and the Eligible Stockholder&#8217;s agreement to provide (1)&#160;within five business days following the later of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed, a written statement by the Eligible Stockholder certifying as to the number of shares it owns and has owned continuously through the record date and (2)&#160;immediate notice if the Eligible Stockholder ceases to own any of the Required Shares prior to the date of the annual meeting;

(e)&#160;&#160;&#160;a representation that the Eligible Stockholder (1)&#160;will continue to hold the Required Shares through the date of the annual meeting, (2)&#160;acquired the Required Shares in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control at the corporation, and does not presently have such intent, (3)&#160;has not nominated and will not nominate for election to the board of directors at the annual meeting any person other than the Stockholder Nominee(s) it is nominating pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, (4)&#160;has not engaged and will not engage in, and has not and will not be a &#8220;participant&#8221;

(g)&#160;&#160;&#160;the written representation and agreement from each Stockholder Nominee that such person (1)&#160;is not and will not become a party to (x)&#160;any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a &#8220; Voting Commitment &#8221;) that has not been disclosed to the corporation in such representation and agreement or (y)&#160;any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with such person&#8217;s ability to comply, if elected as a director of the corporation, with such person&#8217;s fiduciary duties under applicable law; (2)&#160;is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed to the corporation in such representation and agreement;

and (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;in the case of a nomination by a group of stockholders together constituting an Eligible Stockholder in which two or more funds that are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group are counted as one stockholder for purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder, documentation reasonably satisfactory to the corporation that demonstrates that the funds are part of the same Qualifying Fund&#160;Group. (vii)&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to the information required pursuant to Section&#160;2.15(vi) or any other provision of these bylaws, (A)&#160;the corporation may require any proposed Stockholder Nominee to furnish any other information (1)&#160;that may reasonably be requested by the corporation to determine whether the Stockholder Nominee would be independent under the rules and listing standards of the principal United States securities exchanges upon which the capital stock of the corporation is listed or traded, any applicable rules of the SEC or any publicly disclosed standards used by the board of directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the corporation&#8217;s directors (collectively, the &#8220; Independence Standards &#8221;), (2)&#160;that could be material to a reasonable stockholder&#8217;s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such Stockholder Nominee or (3)&#160;that may reasonably be requested by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such Stockholder Nominee to be included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 or to serve as a director of the corporation, and (B)&#160;the corporation may require the Eligible Stockholder to furnish any other information that may reasonably be requested by the corporation to verify the Eligible Stockholder&#8217;s continuous ownership of the Required Shares for the Minimum Holding Period. (viii)&#160;&#160;&#160;The Eligible Stockholder may, at its option, provide to the secretary of the corporation, at the time the Notice of Proxy Access Nomination is provided, a written statement, not to exceed 500 words, in support &#160; G-14 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; of the candidacy of the Stockholder Nominee(s) (a &#8220; Supporting Statement &#8221;). Only one Supporting Statement may be submitted by an Eligible Stockholder (including any group of stockholders together constituting an Eligible Stockholder) in support of its Stockholder Nominee(s). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Supporting Statement (or portion thereof) that it, in good faith, believes would violate any applicable law or regulation. (ix)&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that any information or communications provided by an Eligible Stockholder or a Stockholder Nominee to the corporation or its stockholders ceases to be true and correct in all material respects or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, such Eligible Stockholder or Stockholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the secretary of the corporation of any such defect in such previously provided information and of the information that is required to correct any such defect; it being understood that providing such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the remedies available to the corporation relating to any such defect (including the right to omit a Stockholder Nominee from its proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15).

(x)&#160;&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&#160;2.15, the corporation shall not be required to include in its proxy materials, pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, any Stockholder Nominee (A)&#160;who would not be an independent director under the Independence Standards, (B)&#160;whose election as a member of the board of directors would cause the corporation to be in violation of these bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, the rules and listing standards of the principal United States securities exchanges upon which the capital stock of the corporation is listed or traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation, (C)&#160;who is or has been, within the past three&#160;years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section&#160;8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, (D)&#160;who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past 10&#160;years, (E)&#160;who is subject to any order of the type specified in Rule&#160;506(d) of Regulation&#160;D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (F)&#160;who shall have provided any information to the corporation or its stockholders that was untrue in any material respect or that omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (xi)&#160;&#160;&#160;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if (A)&#160;a Stockholder Nominee and/or the applicable Eligible Stockholder breaches any of its agreements or representations or fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Section&#160;2.15 or (B)&#160;a Stockholder Nominee otherwise becomes ineligible for inclusion in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 or dies, becomes disabled or otherwise becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting, in each case as determined by the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the chairman of the annual meeting, (1)&#160;the corporation may omit or, to the extent feasible, remove the information concerning such Stockholder Nominee and the related Supporting Statement from its proxy materials and/or otherwise communicate to its stockholders that such Stockholder Nominee will not be eligible for election at the annual meeting, (2)&#160;the corporation shall not be required to include in its proxy materials any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the applicable Eligible Stockholder or any other Eligible Stockholder and (3)&#160;the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or the chairman of the annual meeting shall declare such nomination to be invalid and such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. In addition, if the Eligible Stockholder (or a representative thereof) does not appear at the annual meeting to present any nomination pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15, such nomination shall be declared invalid and disregarded as provided in clause (3)&#160;above. (xii)&#160;&#160;&#160;Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the corporation&#8217;s proxy materials for a particular annual meeting but either (A)&#160;withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting, or (B)&#160;does not receive at least 25% of the votes cast in favor of such Stockholder Nominee&#8217;s election, will be ineligible to be a Stockholder Nominee pursuant to this Section&#160;2.15 for the next two annual meetings. &#160; G-15 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence shall not prevent any stockholder from nominating any person to the board of directors pursuant to and in accordance with Section&#160;2.4. Other than Rule&#160;14a-19 under the 1934 Act, this Section&#160;2.15 provides the exclusive method for a stockholder to include nominees for election to the board of directors in the corporation&#8217;s proxy statement. ARTICLE III&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;DIRECTORS 3.1&#160;&#160;&#160;POWERS The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in the DGCL or the certificate of incorporation. 3.2&#160;&#160;&#160;NUMBER OF DIRECTORS The board of directors shall consist of one or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. Unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time solely by resolution of the board of directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director&#8217;s term of office expires. 3.3&#160;&#160;&#160;ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS Except as provided in Section&#160;3.4 of these bylaws, each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until such director&#8217;s successor is elected and qualified or until such director&#8217;s earlier death, resignation or removal. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. The certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. 3.4&#160;&#160;&#160;RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation; provided, however , that if such notice is given by electronic transmission, such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the director. A resignation is effective when the resignation is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. Acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. A resignation which is conditioned upon the director failing to receive a specified vote for reelection as a director may provide that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, when one or more directors resign from the board of directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective.

If the directors are divided into classes, a person so elected by the directors then in office to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board of directors (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the voting stock at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section&#160;211 of the DGCL as far as applicable. 3.5&#160;&#160;&#160;PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE The board of directors may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware. &#160; G-16 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.6&#160;&#160;&#160;REGULAR MEETINGS Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board of directors. 3.7&#160;&#160;&#160;SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairperson of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president, the secretary or a majority of the authorized number of directors, at such times and places as he or she or they shall designate.

If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. The vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 7.2&#160;&#160;&#160;NOTICE BY ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if: (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice. However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: (i)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A)&#160;such posting and (B)&#160;the giving of such separate notice; and (iv)&#160;&#160;&#160;if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. An &#8220; electronic transmission &#8221; means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. &#160; G-23 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; 7.3&#160;&#160;&#160;NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS Except as otherwise prohibited under the DGCL, without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under the provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60&#160;days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice, shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice. 7.4&#160;&#160;&#160;NOTICE TO PERSON WITH WHOM COMMUNICATION IS UNLAWFUL Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful. 7.5&#160;&#160;&#160;WAIVER OF NOTICE Whenever notice is required to be given to stockholders, directors or other persons under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;cash; or (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program, whether through a broker or otherwise, implemented by the Company in connection with the Option. &#160; H-10 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 7.&#160;&#160;&#160; Adjustments; Dissolution of Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control . 7.1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Adjustments . 7.1.1.&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Agreement (and in a manner that will not provide Participant with any greater benefit or potential benefits than intended to be made available under the Agreement, other than as may be necessary solely to reflect changes resulting from any such aforementioned event), will adjust the number, class, and exercise price of shares covered by the Option. 7.1.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by this Section&#160;7.1 be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section&#160;409A of the Code) and accounting (so as not to trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements. 7.2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Dissolution or Liquidation .&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. 7.3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Merger or Change in Control .&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Option will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation, provided that the Administrator may not accelerate the vesting of any portion of the Option, and any portion of the Option that is unvested as of the effective time of a Change in Control will terminate automatically upon such effective time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, upon a Change in Control, any vested and unexercised portion of the Option will be exercisable until the Expiration Date of the Option. For the purposes of this Section&#160;7.3, the Option will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Option confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option, for each Share subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything in this Section&#160;7.3 to the contrary, the Option will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any performance goals under this Agreement without the Participant&#8217;s consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation&#8217;s post-Change in Control corporate structure or in accordance with Section&#160;7.1 will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Option assumption. 8.&#160;&#160;&#160; Leave of Absence .&#160;&#160;&#160;Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of the Option will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. 9.&#160;&#160;&#160; Tax Matters . 9.1.&#160;&#160;&#160; Tax Obligations .&#160;&#160;&#160;Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company, the ultimate liability for any Tax Obligations is and remains Participant&#8217;s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company. Participant further acknowledges that the Company (A)&#160;makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends or other distributions, and (B)&#160;does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option &#160; H-11 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; to reduce or eliminate Participant&#8217;s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject to Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant acknowledges that the Company may be required to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required Tax Obligations hereunder at the time of the applicable taxable event, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares. 9.2.&#160;&#160;&#160; Tax Withholdings .&#160;&#160;&#160;Pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may specify from time to time, the Company shall withhold the amount required to be withheld for the payment of Tax Obligations. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit Participant to satisfy such Tax Obligations, in whole or in part (without limitation), if permissible by Applicable Laws, by (i)&#160;paying cash, or (ii)&#160;selling a sufficient number of such Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the minimum amount that is necessary to meet the withholding requirement for such Tax Obligations (or such greater amount as Participant may elect if permitted by the Administrator, if such greater amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences). 9.3.&#160;&#160;&#160; Code Section&#160;409A .&#160;&#160;&#160;Under Code Section&#160;409A, a stock right (such as the Option) granted with a per Share exercise price that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) to be less than the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant (a &#8220;Discount Option&#8221;) may be considered &#8220;deferred compensation&#8221; and subject the holder of the Discount Option to adverse tax consequences. Participant agrees that if the IRS determines that the Option was granted with a per Share exercise price that was less than the fair market value of a Share on its date of grant, Participant will be solely responsible for Participant&#8217;s costs related to such a determination. In no event will the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company have any liability or obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless Participant for any taxes, interest, or penalties that may be imposed, or other costs incurred, as a result of Section&#160;409A or any state law equivalent. 9.4.&#160;&#160;&#160; Tax Consequences .&#160;&#160;&#160;Participant has reviewed with Participant&#8217;s own tax advisors the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to such matters, Participant relies solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents, written or oral. Participant understands that Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Participant&#8217;s own Tax Obligations and any other tax-related liabilities that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 10.&#160;&#160;&#160; Rights as Stockholder .&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares. 11.&#160;&#160;&#160; No Guarantee of Continued Service .&#160;&#160;&#160;PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING PROVISIONS HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY (AMONG OTHER THINGS) CONTINUING AS THE CHIEF COMPANY EXECUTIVE AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THE OPTION OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER. PARTICIPANT FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING PROVISIONS SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS THE CHIEF COMPANY EXECUTIVE FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND WILL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH PARTICIPANT&#8217;S RIGHT OR THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY (OR THE PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY EMPLOYING OR RETAINING PARTICIPANT) TO TERMINATE PARTICIPANT&#8217;S RELATIONSHIP AS THE CHIEF COMPANY EXECUTIVE OR AS A SERVICE PROVIDER OF THE COMPANY OR ANY PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE. &#160; H-12 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 12.&#160;&#160;&#160; Forfeiture Events .&#160;&#160;&#160;The Administrator shall require, in all appropriate circumstances, forfeiture or repayment with respect to this Option, where: (a)&#160;the vesting of the Option, or any portion of the Option, was predicated upon achieving certain financial results that subsequently were the subject of a financial restatement of the Company&#8217;s financial statements previously filed with the SEC (such restated financial results, the &#8220; Restated Financial Results &#8221;); and (b)&#160;a lesser portion of the Option would have vested based upon the restated financial results. In each such instance, (i)&#160;Participant shall forfeit the vested portion of the Option that would not have vested based on the Restated Financial Results (the &#8220; Forfeited Portion &#8221;); provided that (ii)&#160;to the extent that Participant has exercised any Shares subject to the Forfeited Portion (the &#8220; Purchased Shares &#8221;), the Purchased Shares shall be forfeited to the Company; and provided further, that (iii)&#160;to the extent Participant transferred or disposed of in any manner any Purchased Shares, Participant shall pay to the Company the gross amount of the proceeds resulting from the transfer or other disposition of such Purchased Shares, in a single cash lump sum no later than thirty (30) days following written notice by the Company. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, any forfeiture or repayment required under this Section&#160;12 shall be net of any payments made to Company to exercise this Option, as applicable, and shall be satisfied (A)&#160;first via forfeiture of any vested and outstanding portion of the Option in accordance with clause (i)&#160;of this Section, (B)&#160;next via the forfeiture, of any Shares exercised under the Option Participant holds, in accordance with clause (ii)&#160;of this Section, as applicable, and (C)&#160;lastly by requiring repayment pursuant to clause (iii)&#160;of this Section, as applicable. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary under this Agreement, the Option shall be subject to any clawback policy of the Company currently in effect or that may be established and/or amended from time to time that applies to this Option (the &#8220; Clawback Policy &#8221;), provided that the Clawback Policy does not discriminate solely against Participant except as required by Applicable Laws, and provided further that if there is a conflict between the terms of this Option and the Clawback Policy, the more stringent terms, as determined by the Administrator in good faith, shall apply. The Administrator may require Participant to forfeit, return or reimburse the Company all or a portion of the Option and any amounts paid thereunder pursuant to the terms of the Clawback Policy or as necessary or appropriate to comply with Applicable Laws. 13.&#160;&#160;&#160; Address for Notices .&#160;&#160;&#160;Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement will be addressed to the Company, in care of its General Counsel at Tesla, Inc., 3500 Deer Creek Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing. 14.&#160;&#160;&#160; Non-Transferability of Option .&#160;&#160;&#160;This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Participant only by Participant. 15.&#160;&#160;&#160; Successors and Assigns .&#160;&#160;&#160;The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement to single or multiple assignees, and this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on transfer herein set forth, this Agreement shall be binding upon Participant and Participant&#8217;s heirs, legatees, legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. The rights and obligations of Participant under this Agreement may be assigned only with the prior written consent of the Company. 16.&#160;&#160;&#160; Additional Conditions to Issuance of Stock .&#160;&#160;&#160;If at any time the Company will determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration, qualification or rule compliance of the Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state, federal or non-U.S. law, the tax code and related regulations or under the rulings or regulations of the SEC or any other governmental regulatory body or the clearance, consent or approval of the SEC or any other governmental regulatory authority (together, the &#8220; Issuance Requirements &#8221;) is necessary or desirable as a condition to the purchase by, or issuance of Shares to, Participant (or Participant&#8217;s estate) hereunder, such purchase or issuance will not occur unless and until such Issuance Requirements will have been completed, effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of the Option unless the exercise of the Option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and, to the extent the Company determines to be appropriate, will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, the Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares hereunder prior to the lapse of such reasonable period of time following the date of exercise of the Option as the Administrator may establish from time to time for reasons of administrative convenience. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet the Issuance Requirements. Assuming such satisfaction of the Issuance Requirements, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares will be considered transferred to Participant on the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. The inability of the Company to meet the Issuance Requirements deemed by the Company&#8217;s counsel to be necessary &#160; H-13 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; or advisable for the issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such Issuance Requirements will not have been met. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the person exercising the Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required. 17.&#160;&#160;&#160; Administrator Authority .&#160;&#160;&#160;The Administrator will have the power and authority to construe and interpret this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Agreement as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Shares subject to the Option have vested and whether any Change in Control or any Acquisition has occurred). No acceleration of vesting of any portion of this Option will be permitted on a discretionary basis without the approval of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Administrator in good faith will be final and binding upon Participant, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Administrator will be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to this Agreement. 18.&#160;&#160;&#160; Electronic Delivery .&#160;&#160;&#160;The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Options awarded under this Agreement or future options that may be awarded by the Company by electronic means or request Participant&#8217;s consent to participate in any equity-based compensation plan or program maintained by the Company by electronic means. Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to participate in such plan or program through any on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company. 19.&#160;&#160;&#160; Captions .&#160;&#160;&#160;Captions provided herein are for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Agreement. 20.&#160;&#160;&#160; Agreement Severable .&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event that any provision in this Agreement will be held invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed to have any effect on, the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 21.&#160;&#160;&#160; Modifications to the Agreement .&#160;&#160;&#160;This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties on the subjects covered. Participant expressly warrants that he or she is not accepting this Agreement in reliance on any promises, representations, or inducements other than those contained herein. Modifications to this Agreement can be made only in an express written contract executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company reserves the right to revise this Agreement as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion and without the consent of Participant, to comply with Code Section&#160;409A or otherwise to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Code Section&#160;409A in connection with this Option. 22.&#160;&#160;&#160; No Waiver .&#160;&#160;&#160;Either party&#8217;s failure to enforce any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing each and every other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties herein are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party&#8217;s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances. 23.&#160;&#160;&#160; No Advice Regarding Grant .&#160;&#160;&#160;The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding this Agreement, or Participant&#8217;s acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares.

Was the richest person in the world overpaid? The stockholder plaintiff in this derivative lawsuit says so. He claims that Tesla, Inc.&#8217;s directors breached their fiduciary duties by awarding Elon Musk a performance-based equity-compensation plan. The plan offers Musk the opportunity to secure 12 total tranches of options, each representing 1% of Tesla&#8217;s total outstanding shares as of January&#160;21, 2018. For a tranche to vest, Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization must increase by $50&#160;billion and Tesla must achieve either an adjusted EBITDA target or a revenue target in four consecutive fiscal quarters. With a $55.8&#160;billion maximum value and $2.6&#160;billion grant date fair value, the plan is the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets by multiple orders of magnitude&#8212; &#8203; 250 times larger than the contemporaneous median peer compensation plan and over 33 times larger than the plan&#8217;s &#160; I-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; closest comparison, which was Musk&#8217;s prior compensation plan. This post-trial decision enters judgment for the plaintiff, finding that the compensation plan is subject to review under the entire fairness standard, the defendants bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden. A board of director&#8217;s decision on how much to pay a company&#8217;s chief executive officer&#160;is the quintessential business determination subject to great judicial deference.&#160;But&#160;Delaware&#160;law recognizes unique risks inherent in a corporation&#8217;s transactions&#160;with&#160;its&#160;controlling stockholder. Given those risks, under Delaware law, the&#160;presumptive standard&#160;of review for conflicted-controller transactions is entire fairness.&#160;To invoke&#160;the&#160;entire fairness standard, the plaintiff argues that Musk&#8217;s compensation plan was a conflicted-controller transaction. The plaintiff thus forces the question: Does Musk control Tesla? Delaware courts have been presented with this question thrice before, when more adroit judges found ways to avoid definitively resolving it. 1 This decision dares to &#8220;boldly go where no man has gone before,&#8221; 2 or at least where no Delaware court has tread. The collection of features characterizing Musk&#8217;s relationship with Tesla and its directors gave him enormous influence over Tesla. In addition to his 21.9% equity stake, Musk was the paradigmatic &#8220;Superstar CEO,&#8221; 3 who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO, Chair, and founder), enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla, and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan. At least as to this transaction, Musk controlled Tesla. The primary consequence of this finding is that the defendants bore the burden of proving at trial that the compensation plan was entirely fair. Delaware law allows defendants to shift the burden of proof under the entire fairness standard where the transaction was&#160;approved by a fully informed vote of the majority of the minority stockholders. And&#160;here,&#160;Tesla conditioned the compensation plan on a majority-of-the-minority vote. But the defendants were unable to prove that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the proxy statement inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process. The defendants were thus left with the unenviable task of proving the fairness of the largest potential compensation plan in the history of public markets. If any set of attorneys could have achieved victory in these unlikely circumstances, it was the talented defense attorneys here. But the task proved too tall an order. The concept of fairness calls for a holistic analysis that takes into consideration two basic issues: process and price. The process leading to the approval of Musk&#8217;s compensation plan was deeply flawed. Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla&#8217;s behalf. He had a 15-year relationship with the compensation committee chair, Ira Ehrenpreis. The other compensation committee member placed on the working group, Antonio Gracias, had business relationships with Musk dating back over 20&#160;years, as well as the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk&#8217;s family on a regular basis. The working group included management members who were beholden to Musk, such as General Counsel Todd Maron who was Musk&#8217;s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition. In fact, Maron was a primary go-between Musk and the committee, and it is unclear on whose side Maron viewed himself. Yet many of the documents cited by the defendants as proof of a fair process were drafted by Maron. Given the collection of people tasked with negotiating on Tesla&#8217;s behalf, it is unsurprising that there was no meaningful negotiation over any of the terms of the plan. Ehrenpreis testified that he did not view the negotiation as an adversarial process. He said: &#8220;We were not on different sides of things.&#8221; Maron explained that he viewed the process as &#8220;cooperative&#8221; with Musk. Gracias admitted that there was no &#8220;positional negotiation.&#8221; This testimony came as close to admitting a controlled mindset as it gets. And consistent with this specific-to-Musk approach, the committee avoided using objective benchmarking data that would have revealed the unprecedented nature of the compensation plan. In credit to these witnesses, their testimony was truthful. They did not take a position &#8220;on the other side&#8221; of Musk. It was a cooperative venture. There were no positional negotiations.

Rev. 1353 (2023) [hereinafter &#8220; Superstar CEOs &#8221;]. &#160; I-2 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; and that proposal supplied the terms considered by the compensation committee and the board until Musk unilaterally lowered his ask six&#160;months later. Musk did not seem to care much about the other details. They got ironed out. In this litigation, the defendants touted as concessions certain features of the compensation plan&#8212;a five-year holding period, an M&amp;A adjustment, and a 12-tranche structure that required Tesla to increase market capitalization by $100&#160;billion more than Musk had initially proposed to maximize compensation under the plan. But the holding&#160;period was adopted in part to increase the discount on the publicly disclosed&#160;grant&#160;price, the&#160;M&amp;A adjustment was industry standard, and the 12-tranche&#160;structure&#160;was&#160;reached in an effort to translate Musk&#8217;s fully-diluted-share proposal to the board&#8217;s preferred total-outstanding-shares metric. It is not accurate to refer to these terms as concessions. The defendants also point to the duration of the process (nine&#160;months) and the number of board and committee meetings (ten) as evidence that the process was thorough and extensive. The defendants&#8217; statistics, however, elide the lack of substantive work. Time spent only matters when well spent. Plus, most of the work on the compensation plan occurred during small segments of those nine&#160;months and under significant time pressure imposed by Musk. Musk dictated the timing of the process, making last-minute changes to the timeline or altering substantive terms immediately prior to six out of the ten board or compensation committee meetings during which the plan was discussed. And that is just the process. The price was no better. In defense of the historically unprecedented compensation plan, the defendants urged the court to compare what Tesla &#8220;gave&#8221; against what Tesla &#8220;got.&#8221; This structure set up the defendants&#8217; argument that the compensation plan was &#8220;all upside&#8221; for the stockholders. The defendants asserted that the board&#8217;s primary objective with the compensation plan was to position Tesla to achieve transformative growth, and that Tesla accomplished this by securing Musk&#8217;s continued leadership. The defendants offered Musk an opportunity to increase his Tesla ownership by about 6% (from about 21.9% to at most 28.3%) if, and only if, he increased Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization from approximately $50&#160;billion to $650&#160;billion, while also hitting the operational milestones tied to Tesla&#8217;s top-line (revenue) or bottom-line (adjusted EBITDA) growth. According to the defendants, the deal was &#8220;6% for $600&#160;billion of growth in stockholder value.&#8221; At a high level, the &#8220;6% for $600&#160;billion&#8221; argument has a lot of appeal. But that appeal quickly fades when one remembers that Musk owned 21.9% of Tesla when the board approved his compensation plan. This ownership stake gave him every incentive to push Tesla to levels of transformative growth&#8212;Musk stood to gain over $10&#160;billion for every $50&#160;billion in market capitalization increase. Musk had no intention of leaving Tesla, and he made that clear at the outset of the process and throughout this litigation. Moreover, the compensation plan was not conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term. Swept up by the rhetoric of &#8220;all upside,&#8221; or perhaps starry eyed by Musk&#8217;s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8&#160;billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals? This question looms large in the price analysis, making each of the defendants&#8217; efforts to prove fair price seem trivial. The defendants proved that Musk was uniquely motivated by ambitious goals and that Tesla desperately needed Musk to succeed in its next stage of development, but these facts do not justify the largest compensation plan in the history of public markets. The defendants argued the milestones that Musk had to meet to receive equity under the package were ambitious and difficult to achieve, but they failed to prove this point. The defendants maintained that the plan is an exceptional deal when compared to private equity compensation plans, but they did not explain why anyone would compare a public company&#8217;s compensation plan with a private-equity compensation plan. The defendants insisted that the plan worked in that it delivered to stockholders all that was promised, but they made no effort to prove causation. They also made no effort to explain the rationale behind giving Musk 1% per tranche, as opposed to some lesser portion of the increased value. None of these arguments add up to a fair price. In the final analysis, Musk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit. The process arrived at an unfair price. And through this litigation, the plaintiff requests a recall. The plaintiff asks the court to rescind Musk&#8217;s compensation plan. The plaintiff&#8217;s lead argument is that the court must rescind the compensation plan due to disclosure deficiencies because the plan was conditioned on stockholder approval. This argument, although elegant in its simplicity, is overly rigid and wrong. The plaintiff offers no legal authority for why rescission must automatically follow from an uninformed vote. Generally, a court of equity enjoys broad discretion in fashioning remedies for fiduciary breach, and that general principle applies here. &#160; I-3 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Although rescission does not automatically result from the disclosure deficiencies, it&#160;is nevertheless an available remedy. The Delaware Supreme Court has referred to&#160;recission&#160;&#160;as&#160;the &#8220;preferrable&#8221; &#8203;(but not the exclusive) 4 remedy for breaches of fiduciary&#160;duty&#160;when&#160;rescission can restore the parties to the position they occupied before the challenged transaction. Rescission can achieve that result in this case, where no third-party interests are implicated, and the entire compensation plan sits unexercised and undisturbed. In these circumstances, the preferred remedy is the best one. The plaintiff is entitled to rescission. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND &#8203; Trial took place over five days. The record comprises 1,704 trial exhibits, live testimony from nine fact and four expert witnesses, video testimony from three fact witnesses, deposition testimony from 23 fact and five expert witnesses, and 255&#160;stipulations of fact. These are the facts as the court finds them after trial. 5 A. Tesla And Its Visionary Leader &#8203; Tesla is a vertically integrated clean-energy company. 6 Tesla and its employees &#8220;design,&#160;develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles&#160;and&#160;energy&#160;generation and storage systems.&#8221; 7 As of December&#160;31, 2021, Tesla and its subsidiaries had nearly 100,000 full-time employees worldwide, 8 and its market capitalization was over $1 trillion. 9 Tesla&#8217;s success came relatively recently and, by all accounts, was made possible by Musk. In 2004, Musk led Tesla&#8217;s Series&#160;A financing round, investing $6.5&#160;million. 10 He would invest considerably more before the company went public, take on the role of chairman of Tesla&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) (from April&#160;2004 to November&#160;2018), and, ultimately, become Tesla&#8217;s CEO (since October&#160;2008). 11 Musk possesses the ability to &#8220;dr[aw] others into his vision of the possible&#8221; and &#8220;inspir[e] . . . his workers to achieve the improbable.&#8221; 12 And although Musk was not at the helm of Tesla at its inception, he became the driving visionary responsible for Tesla&#8217;s growth.

The Master Plan &#8203; At the time of Musk&#8217;s initial investment, Tesla was a small-scale startup producing&#160;small quantities of a single vehicle: the Tesla &#8220;Roadster,&#8221; a high-end, battery-powered sports car. 14 By 2006, however, Tesla had broadened its goals. That year, then-chairman Musk published on Tesla&#8217;s blog &#8220;The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan&#8221; 15 (a.k.a., the &#8220;Master Plan&#8221;), which provided a roadmap for Tesla&#8217;s future. Distilled, Musk&#8217;s vision was to start by building the Roadster sports car, to use &#8220;that money to build an affordable car,&#8221; to use &#8220;that money to build an even more affordable car,&#8221; and to &#8220;provide zero emission electric power generation options&#8221; while accomplishing these production milestones. 16 The plan advanced what Musk described as Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;overarching purpose&#8221;&#8212;to move toward a sustainable energy economy, or, as he wrote at the time, to &#8220;expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.&#8221; 17 The Master Plan was bold. Although it might seem difficult to believe now, back then, the market for electric vehicles was unproven. Electric-vehicle technology was &#8220;described as impossible.&#8221; 18 Even traditional automotive startups faced an &#8220;incredibly challenging&#8221; environment in which many failed. 19 In fact, no new domestic car company since Chrysler in the 1920s had achieved financial success. 20 Given the risks, Musk himself viewed the probability of Tesla completing the Master Plan as &#8220;extremely unlikely.&#8221; 21 To even Musk&#8217;s surprise, the Master Plan came to fruition. In abbreviated form, the events played out like this: In 2006, Tesla announced that it would begin to sell the Signature 100 Roadster for approximately $100,000. 22 By August&#160;2007, Tesla had pre-sold 570 Roadsters, 23 which became available in 2008, 24 the same year that Musk became Tesla&#8217;s CEO. 25 Tesla went public in January&#160;2010, raising $226.1&#160;million. 26 In June&#160;2012, Tesla launched the Model S, delivering 2,650 vehicles by year&#8217;s end. 27 Model S sales increased to approximately 22,000 in 2013, 32,000 in 2014, and 50,000 in 2015. 28 Over this period, Tesla developed stationary energy storage products for commercial and residential use, which it began selling in 2013. 29 In 2014, Tesla announced its intent to build its first battery &#8220;Gigafactory&#8221; and work with suppliers to integrate battery precursor material. 30 The factory went live in 2015. 31 In September&#160;2015, Tesla launched the Model X, a midsize SUV crossover. 32 &#8203; 14 Murphy Opening Expert Rep. at 11&#8722;12. 15 JX-48.

The Master Plan, Part&#160;Deux &#8203; By 2016, Tesla had reached the final phase of the Master Plan, 33 and Musk began contemplating the next chapter of Tesla&#8217;s development. In July&#160;2016, he published a new strategic document: &#8220;Master Plan, Part&#160;Deux&#8221; (a.k.a., &#8220;Part&#160;Deux&#8221;). 34 That year, Tesla unveiled a long-range, compact sedan called the &#8220;Model 3.&#8221; 35 Tesla projected that it would begin mass production of the Model 3 in 2017. That endeavor proved the crucible for Tesla. As the company disclosed on March&#160;1, 2017: &#8220;Future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell the Model 3 vehicle . . . .&#8221; 36 Tesla announced another ambitious deadline, stating that its goal was &#8220;to achieve volume production and deliveries of this vehicle in the second half of 2017.&#8221; 37 No one thought Tesla could mass produce the Model 3. 38 Musk stated in Part&#160;Deux that, &#8220;[a]s of 2016, the number of American car companies that haven&#8217;t gone bankrupt is a grand total of two: Ford and Tesla.&#8221; 39 Tesla had come close to bankruptcy in its early&#160;years. 40 And as of March&#160;2017, approximately 20% of Tesla&#8217;s total outstanding shares were sold short, making it the most shorted company in U.S. capital markets at that time. 41 Everyone was betting against Tesla and the man at its helm. 3. Musk&#8217;s Backstory And Motivations &#8203; Musk is no stranger to a challenge, having led the life of a serial entrepreneur. 42 He&#160;and&#160;his brother, Kimbal Musk, 43 launched Musk&#8217;s first start-up in 1995. 44 Musk&#160;later&#160;co-founded an electronic payment system called X.com, which would&#160;be&#160;acquired&#160;and&#160;renamed PayPal. 45 He also founded: in 2002, a rocket development&#160;and&#160;launch&#160;company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (&#8220;SpaceX&#8221;); 46 in 2015, an artificial intelligence research organization, OpenAI Inc.; 47 in 2016, a neurotechnology company, Neuralink Corp.; 48 and, in 2017, a private tunnel-boring company, The Boring Company. 49 &#8203; 33 See JX-335 at 4&#8722;5 (3/1/17 Form 10-K). 34 JX-274. 35 JX-335 at 4. 36 Id. at 17. 37 Id. 38 Trial Tr. at 450:17&#8211;21 (Ahuja); see, e.g. , JX-329 at 1 (2/23/17 Morgan Stanley report dated February&#160;23, 2017, expecting &#8220;no more than a small/modest amount of customer deliveries&#8221; in 2018). 39 JX-274 at 1. 40 Trial Tr. at 17:2&#8722;6 (Ehrenpreis). 41 See JX-995. 42 See Murphy Opening Expert Rep. at 10&#8722;11, 112; see also Trial Tr. at 495:23&#8722;496:11 (Ahuja) (&#8220;Elon is a unique individual who is extremely motivated by super-difficult challenges. . . .

Musk&#160;fears that artificial intelligence could either reduce humanity to &#8220;the equivalent of&#160;a&#160;house cat&#8221; 53 or wipe out the human race entirely. 54 Musk views space colonization as a means to save humanity from this existential threat. 55 Musk seeks to make life &#8220;multiplanetary&#8221; by colonizing Mars. 56 Reasonable minds can debate the virtues and consequences of longtermist beliefs like those held by Musk, but they are not on trial. 57 What is relevant here is that Musk genuinely holds those beliefs. Colonizing Mars is an expensive endeavor. 58 Musk believes he has a moral obligation to direct his wealth toward that goal, 59 and Musk views his compensation from Tesla as&#160;a&#160;means of bankrolling that mission. 60 Musk sees working at Tesla as worthy of his time only if that work generates &#8220;additional economic resources . . . that could . . . be applied to making life multi-planetary.&#8221; 61 &#8203; 50 PTO &#182; 62. 51 Trial Tr. at 568:16&#8722;569:9, 661:7&#8722;15 (Musk); JX-408 at 13.

Musk&#8217;s Prior Compensation Plans &#8203; Prior to the challenged transaction, Musk received two compensation plans from Tesla&#8212;one in 2009 and one in 2012. Both were equity linked. The first included a performance-based component. The second was entirely performance based. 1. The 2009 Grant &#8203; On December&#160;4, 2009, the Board approved Musk&#8217;s first compensation plan (the &#8220;2009 Grant&#8221;). 62 The 2009 Grant comprised two parts, each of which offered Musk stock options to purchase 4% of Tesla&#8217;s fully diluted shares as measured at the grant date. 63 The first part of the 2009 Grant vested automatically in tranches, with 1/4th vesting immediately and 1/48th vesting each month over the following three&#160;years, assuming that Musk continued to work at Tesla. 64 The second part of the 2009 Grant was performance based, offering Musk an additional 4% of Tesla&#8217;s fully diluted shares prior to the grant date for achieving each of the following: &#8220;successful completion of the Model S Engineering Prototype&#8221;; &#8220;successful completion of the Model S Vehicle Prototype&#8221;; &#8220;completion of the first Model&#160;S Production Vehicle&#8221;; and &#8220;completion of the 10,000th Model S Production Vehicle.&#8221; 65 The 2009 Grant required that Musk meet these milestones within four&#160;years; otherwise, he forfeited his right to the unvested portions. 66 Tesla began delivering its next electric car model, the Model S, in June&#160;2012 and Musk achieved all the 2009 Grant&#8217;s performance milestones by December&#160;31, 2013. 67 2. The 2012 Grant &#8203; Before the 2009 Grant milestones had been achieved, on August&#160;1, 2012, the Board approved a second compensation plan for Musk (the &#8220;2012 Grant&#8221;). 68 The 2012 Grant involved ten tranches, each offering options representing 0.5% of Tesla&#8217;s outstanding common stock as of August&#160;2012. 69 For a tranche to vest, Tesla would have to achieve both a market capitalization milestone and an operational milestone. 70 Each tranche required Musk to increase Tesla&#8217;s&#160;market capitalization by $4&#160;billion&#8212;an increment greater than Tesla&#8217;s $3.2&#160;billion&#160;market capitalization 18 trading days before the Board approved the 2012 Grant. 71 The&#160;operational milestones required Tesla to accomplish specified product-related goals, such as developing and launching the Model X and the Model&#160;3, and reaching aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles. 72 The milestones worked in tandem. For example, one tranche would vest if Tesla achieved one of the operational milestones and a &#8203; 62 JX-68 at 2&#8722;3 (1/29/10 Form S-1 (Excerpt)). 63 Id. 64 Id.

In only five years, Tesla&#8217;s&#160;market capitalization grew by over 15x from $3.2&#160;billion to $53&#160;billion. 77 Tesla&#160;saw&#160;significant operational growth as well, designing and launching the Model&#160;S,&#160;Model&#160;X, and Model 3, and increasing its total annual vehicle production from approximately 3,000 total vehicles in 2012 78 to more than 250,000 vehicles in 2017. 79 Musk worked hard toward these goals. And he was paid extremely well. In the end, the value of Musk&#8217;s holdings increased from approximately $981&#160;million to $13&#160;billion, meaning that Musk ultimately received approximately 52x the 2012 Grant&#8217;s grant date fair value. 80 C. The Compensation Process Takes Off. &#8203; In 2017, Tesla was already nearing completion of the 2012 Grant milestones, even though the 2012 Grant had a ten-year term. This prompted a discussion that led to the compensation plan at issue in this litigation (the &#8220;2018 Grant&#8221; or the &#8220;Grant&#8221;). By this time, Musk had accumulated beneficial ownership of 21.9% of the outstanding shares of Tesla common stock through his early investments and the two prior grants. 81 1. Meet The Decision Makers. &#8203; At all relevant times, Tesla had a nine-person Board comprising Musk, Kimbal, Brad W. Buss, Robyn M. Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio J. Gracias, Steve Jurvetson, James Murdoch, and Linda Johnson Rice. 82 The Board had a standing compensation committee (the &#8220;Compensation Committee&#8221;), which was responsible for negotiating Musk&#8217;s compensation plan. 83 Ehrenpreis, Buss, Denholm, and Gracias served on the Compensation Committee, with Ehrenpreis as chair. 84 Musk and Kimbal recused themselves from most of the meetings and all of &#8203; 73 JX-135 at 77; JX-154 at 26. 74 JX-137 at 1 (stating the 2012 Grant expired on August&#160;13, 2022); JX-68 at 3. 75 JX-335 at 45. 76 PTO &#182; 206. 77 Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization was approximately $59&#160;billion as of the proxy statement&#8217;s publication (February&#160;2018) and $53&#160;billion as of the stockholder approval (March&#160;2018).

Denholm &#8203; Denholm joined the Board and the Compensation Committee in 2014. 108 Her background is in accounting and telecommunications. 109 She was recruited to the Board by Buss, who she knew professionally. 110 Musk asked Denholm to be Board chair in 2018 following a settlement with the SEC (the &#8220;SEC Settlement&#8221;) that required Musk to relinquish his chairmanship. 111 Denholm does not appear to have had any personal relationship with Musk outside of her service on the Board. Denholm derived the vast majority of her wealth from her&#160;compensation as a Tesla director. Denholm&#8217;s compensation from Tesla between 2014&#160;and 2017 was valued at about $17&#160;million when it was issued, an amount she&#160;acknowledged was material to her at the time. 112 Denholm ultimately received $280&#160;million&#160;through sales in 2021 and 2022 of just some of the Tesla options she received as part of her director compensation. 113 She described this transaction as &#8220;life-changing.&#8221; 114 Denholm testified that between 2017 and 2019, she received approximately $3&#160;million per year in her non-Tesla position. 115 Even assuming Denholm valued her Tesla compensation at a fraction of its Black-Scholes value, her Tesla compensation far exceeded the compensation she received from other sources. iv.

Murdoch &#8203; Murdoch&#8217;s professional background is in media and entertainment. 144 At the time&#160;he&#160;joined the Tesla Board, he was the CEO of 21st Century Fox. 145 Murdoch met&#160;Musk in the late 1990s, but they lost touch until Murdoch purchased a Tesla Roadster in 2006&#160;or&#160;2007. 146 The two became friends thereafter, meeting when they happened to&#160;be in&#160;the same city. 147 Before he joined the Board, Murdoch, and Musk took family vacations&#160;together to Israel, Mexico, and the Bahamas. 148 During one of these trips, which&#160;Gracias and Kimbal also attended, 149 Musk asked Kimbal to help him decide whether&#160;to add Murdoch to the Board. 150 After the trip, Gracias and Musk invited Murdoch to join the Board, and he agreed. 151 Murdoch and Kimbal are also friendly, and Murdoch attended Kimbal&#8217;s wedding in 2018. 152 As of December&#160;31, 2017, Murdoch owned 10,485 Tesla shares through a family trust. 153 He bought these shares on the market before anyone approached him to become a director. 154 Murdoch now runs a private-investment company, which invested approximately $50&#160;million in SpaceX in 2019 and 2020. 155 Murdoch also personally invested approximately $20&#160;million in SpaceX in 2019. 156 Murdoch received total compensation of approximately $35,000 in cash for his service as a Tesla director in 2017 and 2018. 157 &#8203; 144 Trial Tr. at 815:1&#8722;24 (Murdoch). 145 Id. at 816:4&#8722;8 (Murdoch). 146 Id. at 817:21&#8722;818:19 (Murdoch). 147 Id. at 819:2&#8722;16 (Murdoch). 148 Id. at 820:20&#8722;821:2, 847:5&#8722;849:15 (Murdoch). 149 Id. at 821:3&#8722;13 (Murdoch). 150 Id. at 1080:13&#8722;21 (Kimbal). 151 Id. at 821:21&#8722;822:21 (Murdoch). There are some minor conflicting details in the story of Murdoch&#8217;s addition to the Board. Gracias testified that he was the first to suggest adding Murdoch to the Board during a dinner with Murdoch in New York. Id. at 780:23&#8722;781:1 (Gracias); Gracias Dep. Tr. at 109:25&#8722;110:11. Gracias further testified that he did not speak to Musk about Murdoch joining the Board prior to this dinner. Gracias Dep. Tr. at 109:25&#8722;110:11. It is not clear from Gracias&#8217;s testimony whether this dinner with Murdoch occurred before or after the Bahamas trip. Murdoch testified that Gracias suggested him joining the Board during a lunch (not a dinner) in New York that occurred after the Bahamas trip. Trial Tr. at 821:21&#8722;822:17 (Murdoch). Murdoch&#8217;s lunch and Gracias&#8217;s dinner are presumably the same event (they ate), which took place after the Bahamas trip. But Kimbal testified that Musk asked him to help decide whether Murdoch should join the Board while they were on the Bahamas trip, before the New York meal. Id. at 1080:13&#8722;21 (Kimbal). This suggests two possibilities: one of these three witnesses has confused or misunderstood a detail, or Musk and Gracias independently decided to consider adding Murdoch as a Board member (Musk did not testify about this). In either case, it appears more likely than not that Musk supported Murdoch being added to the Board early in the process. 152 Id. at 850:19&#8722;24 (Murdoch). 153 PTO &#182; 123. 154 Trial Tr. at 827:12&#8722;828:17 (Murdoch). 155 PTO &#182;&#182; 124&#8722;25. 156 Id. &#182; 126. 157 JX-1210 at 20 (3/2/20 James Murdoch&#8217;s Responses and Objections to Interrogatory Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, and 11&#8211;39 from Plaintiff&#8217;s First Set of Interrogatories). &#160; I-14 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; ii. Johnson Rice &#8203; Johnson Rice joined the Board on Gracias&#8217;s recommendation. 158 She and Gracias were friends and ran in the same social circle in Chicago. 159 Johnson Rice&#8217;s sole employer before and during her time at Tesla was a family business, Johnson Publishing Company, which published the magazines Ebony and Jet . 160 She has also served on a number of other boards. 161 Johnson Rice declined to stand for re-election in 2019. 162 Although she received Tesla options as compensation for her work as a director, they expired without being exercised. 163 2. Musk Proposes Terms Of A Compensation Plan. &#8203; The first mention in the record of what would become the 2018 Grant is a text from Ehrenpreis to Musk sent on April&#160;8, 2017&#8212;one day after Tesla&#8217;s Compensation Committee&#160;certified vesting of the 2012 Grant&#8217;s sixth tranche. 164 Ehrenpreis asked Musk to discuss &#8220;a few comp related issues.&#8221; 165 They spoke by phone on April&#160;9. 166 Ehrenpreis testified that he had reached out to Musk to see if he was &#8220;ready to recommit&#8221; 167 and &#8220;to figure out . . . was his head in a place that he wanted to recommit over a longer duration to Tesla[?]&#8221; 168 Musk put forward terms of a new compensation plan during the April&#160;9 call. 169 He envisioned a purely performance-based compensation plan, structured like the 2012 Grant but with more challenging market capitalization milestones 170 and proposed 15 milestones of $50&#160;billion in market capitalization&#8212;a total possible award of 15% of Tesla&#8217;s outstanding shares. 171 &#8203; 158 Gracias Dep.

The draft states: On April&#160;9, 2017, . . . Ira Ehrenpreis, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, and Mr.&#160;Musk discussed the possibility of a new performance award that would have an incentive structure similar to the 2012 Performance Award but with even more challenging performance hurdles. Mr.&#160;Musk expressed interest in such an arrangement and suggested a compensation structure that would incentivize management to grow Tesla into one of the most valuable companies in the world. During this meeting, Mr.&#160;Musk suggesting performance milestones that would trigger stock option awards of 1&#160;% of&#160;the Company&#8217;s current total outstanding shares based&#160;on&#160;incremental $50&#160;billion increases in market capitalization,&#160;such that if Tesla grew by $750&#160;billion, a maximum possible award would amount to 15% of the Company&#8217;s current total outstanding shares. Mr.&#160;Musk indicated that such an award structure would align his incentives with those of stockholders and incentivize him to continue leading the management of the Company over the long-term. Mr.&#160;Ehrenpreis indicated that the Compensation Committee would consider Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s perspectives as part of its analysis. 175 &#8203; 172 JX-1700 at 12; JX-1510 at 27 (cumulative market capitalization of Tesla was approximately $56&#160;billion as of January&#160;10, 2018); JX-757 at 2 (12/31/17 Ford Form&#160;10-K) (aggregate market value of common stock was approximately $42.8&#160;billion as of December&#160;31, 2017); JX-1104 at 1 (2/6/19 GM Form 10-K) (aggregate market value of voting stock was approximately $55.5&#160;billion as of June&#160;30, 2018); see Trial Tr. at 1268:2&#8211;20 (Murphy) (&#8220;You know, with the 2012 plan everybody liked basically we started off by saying we got to double the market cap for you to get anything. Well, now the market cap had grown to 50&#160;billion and it was up to 59&#160;billion by the time they actually approved the plan. But this idea, 50&#160;billion, that&#8217;s a nice round number. I think at the end of 2017, Ford was worth about 49&#160;billion. I think that GM was worth about 58&#160;billion. So this is: Every time we&#8217;ll get another Ford or a GM.

Neither Musk nor Ehrenpreis took contemporaneous notes or otherwise memorialized their April&#160;9 discussion. By the time of discovery and then trial in this action, Musk had only vague memories of the discussion, and Ehrenpreis had no memory of it at all. 177 It is unclear who prepared the draft proxy statement, but Maron, Tesla&#8217;s General Counsel, was responsible for it. Maron testified he spoke to Ehrenpreis within hours of the April&#160;9 call and reviewed the draft. 178 &#8203; 176 See JX-1597 at 9 (1/8/17 Draft Schedule&#160;14A Proxy); JX-1598 at 3 (1/7/18 draft language for Schedule&#160;14A Proxy); JX-1599 at 14 (1/10/18 Draft Schedule&#160;14A Proxy); see also JX-878 at 9&#8211;12 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement) (background section of the final proxy omitting any mention of the April&#160;9 conversation).

But his relationship with Musk raises concerns as to other aspects of the process during which Maron advised the Board and Compensation Committee. Maron joined Tesla as Deputy General Counsel in September&#160;2013, and was promoted to General Counsel in September&#160;2014, reporting directly to Musk. 179 Before joining Tesla, Maron was Musk&#8217;s divorce attorney. 180 Maron neither socialized with Musk nor considered himself a friend of Musk when he worked at Tesla, but he owed his career to and had genuine affection for Musk. 181 Both in his deposition and at trial, Maron held back tears when asked about his departure from Tesla in January&#160;2019, describing it as &#8220;the most difficult decision[]&#8221; he had made to date. 182 After speaking to Ehrenpreis on April&#160;9, Maron enlisted other Tesla employees to help him model Musk&#8217;s proposal. All told, 13 in-house Tesla executives worked on the 2018 Grant. 183 The key executive in addition to Maron was Ahuja, Tesla&#8217;s CFO. 184 At the outset of his involvement, Ahuja recommended one substantive change to the structure&#8212;pairing the market capitalization milestones with operational milestones. 185 He recommended this change for accounting purposes. Maron relayed the change to Ehrenpreis, who questioned whether operational milestones were necessary. 186 Maron explained that &#8220;there&#8217;s an important account[ing] reason&#8221; for having operational milestones. 187 Maron&#8217;s team began analyzing Musk&#8217;s initial proposal on April&#160;10, roping in Tesla&#8217;s legal counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati (&#8220;Wilson Sonsini&#8221;) 188 and lining up compensation consultants. Maron proposed retaining Compensia, Inc., a compensation consulting firm that Tesla had engaged in connection with the 2009 and 2012 Grants, 189 but he also provided four other options for Ehrenpreis to consider. 190 &#8203; 179 PTO &#182;&#182;170&#8211;71; Maron Dep.

Musk States That He Is Committed To Tesla For Life. &#8203; Little progress was made on Musk&#8217;s new compensation plan through May&#160;2017. During a May&#160;3 earnings call, an analyst asked about Musk&#8217;s &#8220;view of staying actively in place with Tesla longer into the future[.]&#8221; 191 Musk responded that he should not be &#8220;CEO forever.&#8221; 192 He further indicated that he was going to reevaluate his position after Tesla achieved volume production of the Model 3. 193 The plaintiff argues that Musk&#8217;s statement about not being &#8220;CEO forever&#8221; was intended to pressure Tesla in negotiations over Musk&#8217;s compensation plan, but the record does not support that conclusion. Musk clarified his statement later in the May&#160;3 earnings call, saying: Well, maybe I wasn&#8217;t clear. I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life. Hopefully, stopping before I get too old&#8212;or too crazy, I don&#8217;t know. But essentially for as long as I can positively contribute to Tesla, I intend to be&#8212;to have a significant involvement with Tesla. 194 In other words, Musk had every intention of remaining &#8220;significant[ly] involved&#8221;&#160;in&#160;some leadership role at Tesla, even though he did not envision himself being&#160;&#8220;CEO forever.&#8221; Musk repeated this assertion at trial, stating unequivocally that&#160;he&#160;would have remained at Tesla even if stockholders had rejected a new compensation plan because he was &#8220;heavily invested in Tesla, both financially and emotionally, and viewed&#160;Tesla as part of his family.&#8221; 195 Trial witnesses similarly testified&#160;that they never&#160;heard&#160;Musk say he had any plans to quit Tesla. 196 And even though Musk did not&#160;intend&#160;&#160;to&#160;stay CEO forever, he had no immediate plans to resign from that position. Corroborating that fact is lack of any succession plans during the relevant period. That is, before 2021, neither Musk nor Tesla had identified a potential successor for the role of Tesla CEO. 197 &#8203; 191 JX-390 at 20. 192 Id. at 20&#8211;21. 193 JX-185 at 12 (&#8220;I think I was&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yes, certainly be CEO for like, say, 4 or 5&#160;years and then it&#8217;s sort of TBD after that.

The First (And Forgettable) Board Discussion &#8203; By June&#160;5, 2017, Tesla had met all ten CEO market capitalization milestones for the 2012 Grant and had only three tranches of operational milestones left to achieve. 198 The Board first discussed the prospect of a new compensation plan for Musk during a June&#160;6, 2017 Board meeting. Musk chaired the meeting. 199 The Board&#8217;s conversation during the June&#160;6 meeting concerning Musk&#8217;s compensation was brief and, apparently, forgettable. During that meeting, Ehrenpreis&#160;updated the Board on the near fulfillment of the 2012 Grant milestones and&#160;stated that &#8220;plans were underway&#160;to design the next compensation program&#8221; for Musk. 200 The minutes of that&#160;meeting are three pages long, and the discussion of a new&#160;compensation plan was&#160;limited&#160;&#160;to&#160;a sentence. 201 At least one director who served on the Compensation Committee, Denholm, did not recall the June&#160;6 Board discussion at all. 202 She testified at trial that any discussion of a new compensation plan during the June&#160;6 Board meeting must not have been substantive. 203 5. Musk Accelerates The Process. &#8203; On June&#160;18, 2017, Maron emailed the Compensation Committee stating: &#8220;We would like to . . . discuss Elon&#8217;s next stock grant.&#8221; 204 This sort of outreach from Maron was common during the process. Although he was counsel to Tesla, he would reach out and prompt action by the Compensation Committee to benefit Musk (the &#8220;we&#8221; in the prior quote). A few days prior, on June&#160;15, 2017, Maron&#8217;s team had prepared an aggressive timeline for approving a compensation plan. The timeline scheduled the Compensation&#160;Committee and Board to approve the plan by July&#160;17 or by July&#160;24 at the&#160;latest. 205 The initial June&#160;15&#160;plan contemplated only two Compensation Committee&#160;meetings prior to final&#160;approval&#160;and&#160;allotted the committee just over a month&#160;to do its job. 206 A later&#160;June&#160;26&#160;version of the&#160;timeline was even more rushed, proposing only one Compensation Committee meeting (with an additional meeting if necessary) and giving the committee less than three weeks to complete its task. 207 That timeline envisioned that on July&#160;7, the Compensation Committee would &#8220;[g]ain agreement on proposed approach, award size and metrics/goals&#8221; and &#8220;[g]ain preliminary approval of grant agreement[.]&#8221; 208 The timeline reflected a reckless approach to a fiduciary process, given that the Compensation Committee had not yet discussed any substantive terms nor met concerning the Grant. Despite the break-neck speed contemplated by the timeline, Maron reported to counsel on June&#160;18 that Ehrenpreis was &#8220;aligned on the plan and timing.&#8221; 209 &#8203; 198 JX-404. 199 PTO &#182; 211; JX-407 at 1 (6/6/17 Board meeting minutes). 200 JX-407 at 2. 201 Id. 202 Denholm Dep. Tr. at 214:14&#8211;19 (&#8220;Q. Just so we&#8217;re clear, focus on June&#160;18th, the Todd Maron email, was that the first time you heard or learned about a potential new compensation plan for Mr.&#160;Musk? A. Yes. I believe so, yes.&#8221;). 203 Trial Tr. at 357:19&#8211;359:14 (Denholm) (stating that the first substantive discussions regarding the 2018 Plan took place on June&#160;23, 2017). 204 JX-420 at 1. 205 JX-423 (6/19/17 email from Matt Tolland to Maron re &#8220;Re: Privileged&#160;- Comp Comm Process&#8221;). 206 Id. 207 JX-456 at 2 (6/26/17 email from Phoung Phillips to Ira Ehrenpreis and Todd Maron re: &#8220;Tesla | Executive Compensation Timeline&#8221;). 208 Id. 209 JX-423 at 1. &#160; I-20 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; After Musk asked to discuss his compensation plan, the Maron-led team was supercharged. They conducted initial calls with five potential compensation consultants&#160;and&#160;selected three for Maron and Ehrenpreis to interview. 210 During the initial&#160;calls, the consultants were informed of Musk&#8217;s initial proposal and the aggressive timeline leading to a late-July approval. 211 Maron and Ehrenpreis updated Musk about the process on June&#160;20, 2017. 212 6. The First Compensation Committee Discussion &#8203; The Compensation Committee discussed Musk&#8217;s compensation plan for the first time on June&#160;23, 2017. 213 The committee formally resolved to retain Wilson Sonsini and Compensia as legal advisor and compensation consultant, respectively. 214 A few days later, Tesla retained Jon Burg at Aon Hewitt Radford (&#8220;Radford&#8221;) to value the 2018 Grant in light of the market-based milestones and to advise on the accounting treatment of the 2018 Grant in light of the performance-based milestones. 215 During the meeting, Ehrenpreis stated that the Compensation Committee&#8217;s aim&#160;was&#160;to&#160;create a new compensation plan similar to the 2012 Grant. The committee then set out the goals for the compensation plan in broad strokes. The minutes of the meeting describe that discussion as follows: The Committee discussed how Mr.&#160;Musk had been and would likely remain a key drive of the Company success and its prospects for growth, and that, accordingly, it would be in Tesla&#8217;s interest, and in the interest of its stockholders, to structure a compensation package that would keep Mr.&#160;Musk as the Company&#8217;s fully engaged CEO. The Committee also discussed the fact that unlike most other Chief Executive Officers Mr.&#160;Musk manages multiple successful large companies. The Committee discussed the importance of keeping Mr.&#160;Musk focused and deeply involved in the Company&#8217;s business, and the corresponding need to formulate a compensation package that would best ensure that Mr.&#160;Musk focuses his innovation, strategy and leadership on the Company and its mission. 216 The minutes do not reflect any discussion by the committee concerning the effect of Musk&#8217;s pre-existing 21.9% equity stake on these goals. &#8203; 210 JX-424 at 1 (6/19/17 email from Phillips to Maron stating, &#8220;[w]e are just doing prep calls with these other folks (so they are slightly prepared when speaking to Ira). Also, Yun and I are hoping to take 5 down to 3 teams so we don&#8217;t waste Ira&#8217;s time. Do you want to be included in the preliminary meetings&#160;- we realized it takes about 30 minutes to explain what we want and we want to see if they even understand what we are asking before we present them in front of you and Ira.&#8221;); see also JX-432 at 1 (noting the three calls with the compensation consultants). 211 See, e.g. , JX-434 at 4 (Brown&#8217;s handwritten notes of June&#160;19 and 20 calls stating under the heading &#8220;Goals . . .

Tr. at 155:3&#8211;156:18 (confirming &#8220;check-ins&#8221; with Musk). 213 The topic did not come up during their meeting held on June&#160;5, although that was the day before the Board was informed that &#8220;plans are underway.&#8221; JX-405 (6/5/17 Compensation Committee meeting minutes) (no mention of Musk&#8217;s package); JX-407 6/6/17 Board meeting minutes) (first mention of plans for the 2018 Grant); see also JX-420 (6/18/17 email from Maron to Compensation Committee proposing June&#160;23 meeting to discuss Musk compensation). 214 See JX-439 at 2; PTO &#182; 214. 215 PTO &#182;151; JX-455 (6/26/17 Radford engagement authorization form). 216 JX-439 at 1. &#160; I-21 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The committee was not presented with any proposed terms for a compensation plan, and it did not consider any. This was the case even though, behind the scenes, Ehrenpreis and Musk had discussed Musk&#8217;s initial proposal, which Musk&#8217;s team had already modeled. 217 Although the committee had no idea what the terms of the plan might be, they were told to be prepared to approve it in July. 218 Brown thought the timeline was unwise. 219 Brown called Ehrenpreis to ask for more time to work on the matter, 220 but Ehrenpreis responded that &#8220;this is the timeline we are working with.&#8221; 221 A member of Maron&#8217;s team would later repeat that message, telling both Brown and Burg that &#8220;we are running up against a short deadline and we have to make sure this keep [sic] moving.&#8221; 222 The message was clear&#8212;move at full tilt. Other than Brown, there is no evidence that anyone questioned the timeline. 7. The First Working Group Meeting &#8203; After the June&#160;23 Compensation Committee meeting, Ehrenpreis formed a &#8220;Working Group.&#8221; The group consisted of Maron and at least two in-house attorneys who reported to him (Phillip Chang and Phuong Phillips), Ahuja, Brown, Burg, and attorneys from Wilson Sonsini. 223 Ehrenpreis and Gracias were in the Working Group, but the Compensation Committee decided that the two members with less extensive ties to Musk&#8212;Denholm and Buss&#8212; &#8203; were &#8220;optional&#8221; attendees. 224 &#8203; 217 Specifically, on June&#160;23, Tesla&#8217;s Deputy General Counsel Phil Rothenberg sent an Excel spreadsheet titled &#8220;Elon Grant 2017&#8221; to Kenneth Moore, another Tesla employee.&#160;JX-445 at 3&#8211;4. The spreadsheet models a 15-tranche structure with operational&#160;milestones. The model also includes a &#8220;Performance Milestone&#8221; column with&#160;each row marked &#8220;tbd.&#8221; There are some quirks with the terms reflected in the June&#160;23 spreadsheet, which make it clear that the spreadsheet was an early model that&#160;needed to be refined, but to mention them briefly: Each tranche triggers as Tesla&#8217;s&#160;stock price rises from $300 to $4,800 at $300 increments per tranche over 15 tranches, each of which gives Musk the right to purchase 1.6&#160;million shares at $300 per&#160;share. The grant value of each tranche is calculated by multiplying 1.6&#160;million by the differential between the market price of Tesla stock and the $300 exercise price. The result is $480&#160;million for tranche one (at a market price of $600 per share), $980&#160;million for tranche two (at a market price of $ 900 per share), and so on. Adding up all 15 tranches this way yields $57.6&#160;billion. The $57.6&#160;billion figure, however, is not the total possible award that Musk could reach under this proposal. Triggering all 15 tranches would result in a total grant value of $108&#160;billion. 218 JX-1592 at 9 (6/23/17 email from Chang to Ehrenpreis) (listing approval date in July); JX-437 at 7 (same). Trial Tr. at 130:7&#8211;13 (Ehrenpreis) (&#8220;Q. It&#8217;s also true, though, isn&#8217;t it, that at the June&#160;23rd compensation committee meeting, the committee wasn&#8217;t shown any of the specific metrics that had been working&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that the group had been working on, like 1&#160;percent tranches or $50&#160;billion market caps? A.

Phillips proposed the agenda, 225 and Brown prepared a slide deck with a high-level overview of the suggested terms of Musk&#8217;s&#160;new equity plan. 226 In relevant part, the presentation included: a few slides summarizing the 2012 Grant; 227 a slide titled &#8220;Preliminary Concept,&#8221; reflecting the 15-tranche combined&#160;market and operational goals structure; 228 and three slides titled &#8220;Key Program Terms: Alternatives and Considerations,&#8221; which identified terms of the compensation plan under the title &#8220;Preliminary Alternatives&#8221; and considerations relevant to each term under the title &#8220;Considerations/Decision Points.&#8221; 229 The presentation identified the following question for discussion: &#8220;Will both operational and company valuation goals be used?&#8221; 230 By framing the structure as a question, the presentation suggests that it was an open issue. Brown&#8217;s notes on a June&#160;26 draft version of this presentation, however, reflect that the issue had in fact been resolved. 231 He wrote that: &#8220;there will be 15 goals of each type[,]&#8221; referring to both market capitalization and operational goals, and &#8220;the market cap goals are increments of $50B, for a total of $750B of incremental market cap growth for all 15 tranches (yes, there [sic] numbers are what they are thinking!)[.]&#8221; 232 In part, therefore, the presentation was a vehicle for getting the Compensation Committee members up to speed on the work done behind the scenes prior to that time. After the June&#160;30 meeting, the Working Group stood poised to move forward. Chang&#160;emailed members of the group about developing operational milestones, including&#160;&#160;a&#160;structure in which each market capitalization milestone would also require&#160;&#160;an&#160;increase of&#160;$15&#160;billion in GAAP revenue. 233 Chang stated that Tesla should &#8220;expect to achieve a milestone roughly once every 12 to 15&#160;months over the next 3&#160;years.&#8221; 234 8. Musk Decelerates The Process. &#8203; The Working Group met again on July&#160;6, the day before the next Compensation Committee meeting. After this meeting, Maron informed Chang, Ahuja, and others that &#8220;we&#8217;re now going on a slower track with the CEO grant. We&#8217;re now looking to issue it in August or September instead of within the next couple of weeks.&#8221; 235 Maron professed ignorance as to why the timeline decelerated. 236 Chang and Phillips too lacked any recollection. 237 Ehrenpreis testified that &#8220;it was way too complex to do under what was originally described as a preliminary timeline&#8221; but did not&#160;recall additional details. 238 Brown testified that he received pushback when he asked&#160;to extend the timeline, so he was not the impetus for the delay. 239 Maron would not have made the determination &#8203; 225 JX-473. 226 JX-475. 227 Id. at 3, 10. 228 Id. at 4. 229 Id. at 5&#8211;7. 230 JX-464 at 7.

The reality is that Maron answered to and spoke for Musk in this context. It was Musk who either asked to slow things down or stopped pushing to get them done so quickly. 240 Phillips circulated &#8220;the proposed new timeline for Elon&#8217;s equity grant&#8221; to the Working Group on the evening of July&#160;6. 241 The initial timeline contemplated preliminary approval by the Compensation Committee on July&#160;7 and final approval by the committee and Board approval by July&#160;24. The revised timeline pushed final approval by the committee and Board out to September&#160;8 and September&#160;19, respectively. 242 9. The First Compensation Committee Discussion Of The Substantive Terms &#8203; The July&#160;7 Compensation Committee went forward as scheduled, but the agenda was revised given the new timeline. The revised agenda included &#8220;a short presentation re the CEO grant&#8221; from Brown. 243 This was the first meeting where the committee would be presented with terms of a compensation plan. In addition to the $50&#160;billion market capitalization milestones that Musk had proposed, Brown&#8217;s presentation covered alternatives&#8212;a flat $25&#160;billion increase or graduated milestones beginning at $10&#160;billion and increasing to $50&#160;billion. 244 These different market capitalization approaches corresponded to different award sizes, ranging from 7.5% of total outstanding shares to Musk&#8217;s proposed 15%. 245 Although the presentation identified alternatives to Musk&#8217;s proposal, the presentation included a valuation only for Musk&#8217;s proposal. 246 The presentation was therefore biased toward Musk&#8217;s proposal, although this was the first meeting at which the committee had considered any terms. In addition to the market capitalization and operational milestones, the presentation identified other potential grant features, including the following: &#8226; A &#8220;Clawback Provision.&#8221; 247 Around April&#160;2015, the Board adopted new Corporate Governance Guidelines (the &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;) providing that Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;executive officers [are] subject to a clawback policy relating to the repayment of certain incentives if there is a restatement of our financial statements.&#8217;&#8221; 248 The presentation contained the following question: &#8220;Is the current clawback provision sufficient protection for the Company?&#8221; 249 There is no evidence that the committee discussed this question or ever demanded a more protective Clawback Provision. The final version of the Grant included a Clawback Provision based on the Guidelines. 250 &#8203; &#8203; 240 Musk denied aspects of this finding. See Musk Dep. Tr. at 172:19&#8211;174:1 (denying that he was &#8220;pushing for&#8221; the grant to &#8220;happen quickly&#8221; in early July&#160;2017, and stating that he was &#8220;generally erring on the side of . . . [going] slowly[,]&#8221; and did not &#8220;recall the exact reason&#8221; why the process slowed down in early July). But his recollection of relevant events was generally spotty. 241 JX-495. 242 JX-423 at 2&#8211;3; JX-456 at 2; JX-495 at 6&#8211;7. 243 JX-503 at 1. 244 JX-510 at 1, 12. 245 Id. at 13. 246 Id. at 24. 247 JX-475 at 7.

The presentation noted that &#8220;post-exercise hold periods decrease the grant/accounting value&#8221; of the stock as follows: &#8220;2 year = -15%; 3&#160;years = -18%; and 5&#160;years = -22%.&#8221; 253 &#8203; Benchmarking analyses were on the advisors&#8217; minds. Prior to the first Working Group&#160;meeting, Phuong suggested an agenda item addressing &#8220;[b]enchmark companies&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;risks associated with such grant.&#8221; 254 And Brown&#8217;s presentation for the July&#160;7&#160;Compensation Committee meeting contained an appendix listing the &#8220;Largest CEO&#160;Pay Packages in 2016&#8221;; summaries of other executive compensation plans at SolarCity,&#160;Nike, Avago Technologies, and Apple; Radford&#8217;s $3.1&#160;billion valuation of a grant&#160;featuring $50&#160;billion market capitalization milestones and awarding 15% of total&#160;outstanding shares; and Radford&#8217;s additional preliminary models based on different&#160;market capitalization approaches. 255 But the appendix data does not constitute&#160;&#160;a&#160;traditional benchmarking study, 256 and it is unclear whether the committee discussed this information or the &#8220;risks associated with such grant&#8221; in any event. 10. Stockholder Outreach &#8203; During the July&#160;7 meeting, the Compensation Committee tasked Ehrenpreis and Maron with contacting Tesla&#8217;s largest institutional stockholders to discuss Musk&#8217;s new compensation plan. 257 Maron&#8217;s team worked with outside counsel to prepare talking points to use during the calls. 258 They ultimately spoke to 15 stockholders between July&#160;7, 2017, and August&#160;1, 2017. 259 Maron&#8217;s subordinates joined these calls and took notes. 260 As scripted, Ehrenpreis was to: introduce himself and Maron and identify his objectives as Compensation Committee chair (to &#8220;keep executives engaged and performing&#160;their best&#8221;); sing Musk&#8217;s praises (&#8220;I think we can all agree that he&#8217;s&#160;an&#160;extraordinary leader and continues to accomplish incredible things for Tesla and its&#160;stockholders&#8221;); remind the stockholders of the &#8220;[i]ncredible success of the 2012 Grant&#8221;;&#160;and explain that they are considering a new compensation structure for Musk and that &#8220;[o]bviously, the goals of the new program will be similar to the 2012 grant[.]&#8221; 261 In this litigation, the defendants report that the stockholders to whom Ehrenpreis and Maron spoke &#8220;were pleased with the 2012 Plan&#8217;s results and supported a similar approach for a new compensation plan,&#8221; 262 and that &#8203; 251 JX-464 at 7 (&#8220;If market cap/enterprise value used, how to account for the impact of financing or acquisition activities, where market cap increases may not translate to stock price increases?

First, the script reads like a loaded questionnaire intended to solicit positive stockholder feedback and not a method for gaining objective stockholder perspectives on a potential new plan. There is nothing inherently wrong with the script; it simply undermines the evidentiary weight of the resulting communications. Second, what the stockholders said in response to these inquiries is hearsay and untested by the adversarial process, including cross examination. 264 11. The Working Group Develops Operational Milestones. &#8203; The Working Group next met on July&#160;17. 265 One of the objectives for the meeting&#160;was&#160;to establish a metric for operational milestones. Brown prepared a presentation for the meeting that listed the following potential operational metrics: &#8220;EBITDA; operating income; free cash flow; gross margin; strategic/execution goals&#8221; &#8203;(such as introducing a new model or producing a certain number of&#160;units, as in the 2012 Grant); and &#8220;Return Metrics (ROA, ROIC, ROE),&#8221; with each option paired with a handful of &#8220;advantages&#8221; and &#8220;disadvantages.&#8221; 266 Ahuja had developed the strategic milestones for the 2012 Grant, and he took responsibility for developing the operational milestones for the 2018 Grant. 267 On July&#160;19,&#160;Burg sent Ahuja and other members of the Working Group an analysis of the historical market capitalization-to-revenue ratio of large U.S. companies. 268 Ahuja used&#160;this data to propose starting with a 6.5x revenue-to-market-capitalization-milestone ratio, which&#160;could be used to determine the initial revenue milestones&#8212;$7.5&#160;billion&#160;additional&#160;revenue for each $50&#160;billion in market capitalization. The revenue milestones then declined to 4x for the final tranches at increments of $12.5&#160;billion for each $50&#160;billion market capitalization increment. 269 On July&#160;23, Ahuja suggested four EBITDA milestones in addition to the 15 revenue-based milestones: $4&#160;billion, $8&#160;billion, $12&#160;billion, and $16&#160;billion. 270 Ahuja projected that Tesla &#8220;should be able to get to $12B EBITDA in the next 4&#8211;5&#160;years depending on volumes . . . and margin assumptions[.]&#8221; 271 &#8203; 263 Id. at 30. 264 See JX-522 at (notes on Jennison call); JX-546 at 1 (notes on Fidelity call); JX-551 at 1 (notes on Baillie Gifford call); JX-552 at 1 (notes on Baron call); JX-531 at 5 (slide featuring comments from T.

Of these options, Ahuja and Maron preliminarily expressed in advance of the meeting that they favored revenue. JX-526 at 1&#8211;3 (7/10/17 emails between Ahuja, Maron, and Chang re: Operational Metrics). Consistent with this preference, the presentation makes a case for revenue, describing it as &#8220;the most objective financial metric&#8221; and noting that the only listed downsides could be mitigated with other, already-discussed plan features. JX-530 at 5 (&#8220;Disadvantages . . . [1.] Requires adjustments for acquisition activities (e.g., goal increases for acquired companies)[;] [2.] Ignores profitability and may incentivize price cutting/lower margins; however, this concern mitigated if paired with long-term market cap goals[.]&#8221;). All of the other metrics are accompanied by multiple downsides, and none of the downsides for the non-revenue metrics included explanations of how those downsides could be mitigated or obviated by other plan features.

As discussed infra , however, there is a lot of competing testimony on the reliability of Tesla&#8217;s projections. &#160; I-26 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The agenda for the July&#160;17 Working Group Meeting included discussion of an M&amp;A Adjustment and a Hold Period. 272 Brown prepared a detailed slide on the M&amp;A Adjustment, but there are no contemporaneous communications reflecting discussion of the adjustment beyond that slide. 273 As to the Hold Period, the presentation noted that the Guidelines required a six-month post-vesting Hold Period. 274 The next day, Phillips emailed Burg and Brown&#160;a&#160;question from Ehrenpreis about &#8220;creative options&#8221; they could employ to &#8220;solve&#160;for getting a bigger discount&#8221; on the publicly reported grant date fair value, 275 such as extending the Hold Period to five&#160;years (the &#8220;Five-Year Hold Period&#8221;). 276 Burg provided holding periods ranging from one to ten&#160;years and types of options with corresponding discounts. 277 After the July&#160;17 meeting, the Working Group began planning for an August&#160;1, 2017 Compensation Committee meeting. 278 The agenda for the meeting included an update for the full Board (excluding Musk and Kimbal) on the structure under discussion for the compensation plan and on stockholder feedback on the structure. 279 Maron sent an email to the full Board on July&#160;27, summarizing the process to date and asking everyone to attend upcoming Compensation Committee meetings. 280 12. Musk Hits The Brakes. &#8203; Late July&#160;2017 proved a busy time for Tesla, which delivered the first Model 3 on July&#160;29. This triggered the eighth milestone in Musk&#8217;s 2012 Grant. 281 It also prompted Musk to, once again, reset the Compensation Committee&#8217;s timeline. In Maron&#8217;s view, given the struggles with the Model 3 launch, Musk&#8217;s desired to extend the timeline either because he was unsure whether to commit to Tesla (which Musk denied) or simply did not want to focus on compensation during a busy time. 282 Whatever the reason, Musk hit the brakes on the process. On June&#160;30, two days before the planned Compensation Committee meeting, Musk sent Maron a brief email asking to put the discussion of his compensation &#8220;on hold for a few weeks[.]&#8221; 283 Maron replied that he would &#8220;rather keep cranking on it . . . because there&#8217;s a fair amount to it that we&#8217;ve been working on with the board and there&#8217;s lead time involved.&#8221; 284 Musk agreed to let Maron proceed, stating that he &#8220;[j]ust want[ed] to make sure Tesla interests come first.&#8221; 285 Musk reminded Maron that &#8220;[t]he added comp is just so that I can put as much as possible towards minimizing existential risk by putting the money towards Mars if I am successful in leading Tesla to be one of the world&#8217;s most valuable companies. This is kinda crazy, but it is true.&#8221; 286 &#8203; 272 JX-530 at 3 (7/17/17 Working Group discussion document). 273 Id. at 10. 274 Id. at 8. 275 JX-535 at 1&#8211;2 (7/18/17 email from Phillips to Radford and Compensia asking them to compute what the discount would be if &#8220;Elon had to hold all exercised shares for 5&#160;years?&#8221;). 276 Id. 277 JX-544 at 1&#8211;2 (7/21/17 email from Burg to Compensia, Chang, Ahuja, and other Tesla team members re: &#8220;Update to Slide Per Ira&#8217;s Request&#8221;). 278 JX-554 at 1. 279 Id. 280 JX-559 (7/27/17 email from Maron to Gracias, et al. re &#8220;CEO Comp planning&#8221;). 281 JX-563 (7/30/17 email from Gracias to Maron re: &#8220;Tesla UWC - Milestone Achievement&#8221;). 282 Maron Dep.

The Process Goes Off Course. &#8203; By August&#160;2017, Musk remained hyper-focused on Model 3 production, which was proving slow and painful. 287 As Musk described at trial, &#8220;[t]he sheer amount of pain required to achieve that goal, there are no words to express.&#8221; 288 This aspect of Musk&#8217;s testimony was totally credible. Although Musk agreed to allow Maron to &#8220;keep cranking,&#8221; progress on Musk&#8217;s compensation plan had slowed to a halt. 289 From August through September, there was some discussion of Musk&#8217;s compensation plan but no action, and there were no meaningful discussions of the 2018 Grant in October. 290 The highlights of this interregnum are discussed in brief below. &#8203; 287 JX-615 at 4 (9/5/17 email from Musk describing &#8220;[t]he slow progress&#8221; as &#8220;extremely alarming,&#8221; demanding production of 1,000 Model 3 vehicles in the final week of September, stating &#8220;[c]ome hell or high water that 1000 unit number is going to f***ing happen if I have to help build them myself. . . .

I am hoping we can get on a call tomorrow with this small group to discuss next steps, proposed timeline and slides,&#8221; although it does not appear that any call took place); JX-604 at 1 (8/27/17 email from Ahuja to Working Group members stating &#8220;[i]t was decided to defer [] action by a few&#160;months&#8221;). 290 Materials for the October&#160;5 Compensation Committee meeting, for instance, make no mention of the 2018 Grant. See JX-650. &#160; I-28 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The Compensation Committee held a telephonic meeting on August&#160;1, and Compensia made a presentation during that meeting that summarized the committee&#8217;s progress to date. 291 The most notable aspect of this meeting concerned the following &#8220;key&#160;question&#8221; that went undiscussed: &#8220;Is additional compensation for the CEO required&#160;given his current ownership and its potential appreciation with Company performance?&#8221; 292 Musk had made his initial proposal in April&#160;2017, and the original&#160;timeline had the process wrapping up by July&#160;2017, but this was the first time that&#160;this&#160;&#8220;key&#160;question&#8221; had been posed&#8212;did Musk require additional compensation? The most curious thing about this question is that there is no evidence that any director deliberated over it, and it did not appear in any other Board or committee materials. 293 The next event of interest occurred on September&#160;8, when Ehrenpreis and Denholm spoke to Musk to discuss his compensation plan. 294 Once again, the most notable aspect of this conversation concerns a question that went undiscussed. The agenda for the September&#160;8 call identified the following topic for discussion: &#8220;Should some type of commitment be included as part of comp structure?&#8221; 295 Trial testimony revealed that no&#160;one&#160;raised this issue with Musk. 296 Ehrenpreis recalled discussing Musk&#8217;s dedication to&#160;Tesla&#160;generally. 297 And Maron&#8217;s summary of the call reflects that the participants&#160;discussed&#160;the &#8220;opportunity costs&#8221; of Musk devoting time to Tesla. 298 Although Musk didn&#8217;t &#8220;have a good recollection of [the September&#160;8] call,&#8221; 299 he was confident that they did not discuss a time or attention commitment &#8220;vis-&#224;-vis [Musk&#8217;s] other interests.&#8221; 300 Musk said &#8220;that would be silly.&#8221; 301 &#8203; 291 JX-566 at 10&#8211;15 (8/1/17 slide deck for Compensation Committee meeting, with a slide titled: &#8220;For Reference: Preliminary Work to Date&#8221;). 292 Id. at 7&#8211;8. 293 The presentation also: reflected Musk&#8217;s proposed 15-tranche structure; described the operational milestones as &#8220;TBD&#8221;; and included questions about a Clawback Provision (&#8220;Should there be an expanded clawback provision, or is the current provision from the Corporate Governance Guidelines adequate?&#8221;), an M&amp;A Adjustment (&#8220;How should corporate transactions and potential changes in control be addressed?&#8221;), and a Hold Period (&#8220;What limitations should there be on the form of exercise, and should extended post-exercise holding period(s) for earned shares be established?&#8221;).

Ehrenpreis reported on the committee&#8217;s progress 302 and the September&#160;8 conversation with Musk. 303 Brown gave a presentation covering much of the same ground as the August&#160;1 presentation. Brown valued the 15% market capitalization option at a $2&#8211;3&#160;billion grant date fair value. 304 According to the meeting minutes, &#8220;[t]he Board expressed its general support for the overall structure of&#8221; the Grant, meaning the 15-tranche structure. 305 The Board favored &#8220;a long-term stock option grant . . . with performance-based vesting, primarily keyed to the market capitalization of the Company[.]&#8221; 306 The Board noted that &#8220;Musk was driven by large goals[,]&#8221; and &#8220;viewed the discussed targets as achievable given the potential of the Company and believed that Mr.&#160;Musk would as well.&#8221; 307 Before this period of inactivity, the only milestones that had been discussed were the $50&#160;billion market capitalization milestones. Operational milestones remained &#8220;TBD,&#8221; 308 but Ahuja gave some thought to them in August and September. There was a Working Group meeting on August&#160;3, 309 and after that time, discussions focused on adjusted EBITDA. 310 It is unclear who made the decision to focus on that metric. On August&#160;17, Ahuja asked one of his employees for &#8220;operational metrics [that] will line up with 15 increments of $50B in market cap.&#8221; 311 Ahuja envisioned 15 adjusted EBITDA milestones &#8220;ranging from $2B to $25B&#8221; and requested comparisons to historic&#160;EBITDA/market capitalization correlations for Apple, Amazon, and Google. 312 After pulling the data, members of Ahuja&#8217;s team responded that they &#8220;didn&#8217;t see immediate parallels to where we are.&#8221; 313 Ahuja requested more information on the data they gathered concerning &#8220;% Adjusted EBITDA/Revenue and Market Cap to Adjusted EBITDA multiple.&#8221; 314 The day after the September&#160;19 Board meeting, Ahuja reached out to his team for help developing &#8220;10 Adjusted EBITDA based metrics that end at a revenue of about $150B and market cap of about $800B using % and multiples which start high and progressively become lower.&#8221; 315 He explained that &#8220;[t]he thinking is that we will develop EBITDA &#8203; 302 PTO &#182; 225; JX-631 (9/19/17 special Board meeting minutes); JX-629 at 3 (9/18/17 email from Maron to the Board attaching a document stating, &#8220;[d]ecisions to be made at this meeting: 1.

The Process Restarts. &#8203; By the end of October, Tesla&#8217;s production difficulties seemed to be easing. A &#8220;Quarterly Update Letter&#8221; signed by Musk and Ahuja for the Board&#8217;s audit committee (the &#8220;Audit Committee&#8221;) at its October&#160;31, 2017 meeting was generally optimistic. It stated that the &#8220;production rate will soon enter the steep portion of the manufacturing S-curve,&#8221; which would create &#8220;non-linear production growth&#8221; in the following weeks. 320 With Tesla&#8217;s production stabilizing, Musk turned his attention back to his compensation plan. 1. Musk Lowers His Ask. &#8203; In the early hours of November&#160;9, Musk sent Maron an email stating that he wanted to &#8220;move forward with [his compensation plan] now, but in a reduced manner from before.&#8221; 321 Musk testified that by &#8220;reduced,&#8221; he meant something less than 15% of total outstanding shares. 322 It is unclear why Musk decided to lower his ask. It is possible that he was just trying to single-handedly calibrate the compensation package to terms that were more reasonable. Later that morning, Musk told Maron that he would &#8220;like to take board action as soon as possible if they feel comfortable and then it would go to shareholders.&#8221; 323 Musk stated: I think the amount should be reduced to a 10% increment in my Tesla ownership if I can get us to a $550B valuation, but that should be a fully diluted 10%, factoring in that it dilutes me too. So if it hypothetical [sic] was awarded to me now and I own (probably) ~20% fully diluted, then I would have ~30%. Of course there will be future dilution due to employee grants and equity raises, so probably this is more like 25% or so in 10&#160;years when it has some chance of being fully awarded. 324 The implication of Musk&#8217;s proposal to use a 10% fully diluted figure at 1% per tranche is that he now sought a ten-tranche structure. Moments later, Musk sent Maron another email stating: Given that this will all go to causes that at least aspirationally maximize the probability of a good future for humanity, plus all Tesla shareholders will be super happy, I think this will be received well. It should come across as an ultra bullish view of the future, given that this comp package is worth nothing if &#8216;all&#8217; I do is almost double Tesla&#8217;s market cap. 325 &#8203; 316 Id. 317 JX-641 at 1. 318 Id. at 4; JX-642; JX-643. 319 JX-641 at 1; see also JX-642 (9/21/17 Spreadsheet of Milestones, Sheet Two, Columns F, N). 320 JX-1540 at 84 (10/31/17 Audit Committee meeting materials). 321 JX-664. 322 Trial Tr. at 676:18&#8211;677:1 (Musk). 323 JX-664. 324 Id. 325 Id. &#160; I-31 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Ehrenpreis relayed Musk&#8217;s revised proposal to the Board at a special meeting on November&#160;16, 2017. 326 In advance of that meeting, Chang sent Ehrenpreis a list of talking points, stating the &#8220;[n]umbers we are talking about are now lower than before . . . 10 tranches to $550&#160;billion; 1% per tranche[.]&#8221; 327 2. Some Turbulence &#8203; Meanwhile, on November&#160;13, Jurvetson began a leave of absence. 328 At the time, Jurvetson had been a managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson (&#8220;DFJ&#8221;), a venture capital firm with investments in Tesla and other Musk-related businesses. 329 Following a scandal, Jurvetson was removed from DFJ. This became a &#8220;PR problem&#8221; for Tesla. 330 Jurvetson returned to the Board in April&#160;2019 but left again in September&#160;2020. 331 On November&#160;14, Musk emailed Maron again, asking to &#8220;pause for a week or two&#8221; on his compensation plan as it would be &#8220;terrible timing.&#8221; 332 At trial, Musk did not recall the nature of the problem. He is a smart person, though, and it is possible that he thought it was better to avoid releasing controversial news on the heels of controversial news. 333 3. Musk Further &#8220;Negotiates Against Himself.&#8221; &#8203; Musk&#8217;s November&#160;9 proposal had the unintended consequence of raising Musk&#8217;s demand. According to Chang, Musk&#8217;s demand to increase his current&#160;percentage of fully diluted shares (approximately 18.9%) by ten&#160;percentage points (to approximately 28.9%) would require an award of 28,959,496 shares, which equaled approximately 17.23% of total outstanding shares as of November&#160;2017. 334 Musk&#8217;s November&#160;9 request, therefore, turned out to be larger than his initial proposal, contrary to Musk&#8217;s desire for a &#8220;reduced&#8221; amount. 335 Maron sent Chang&#8217;s calculations to Musk on November&#160;29. 336 Maron presented to Musk both (i)&#160;the total amount of shares Musk would receive based on his November&#160;9 request for an additional 10% on a fully diluted basis (28,959,456 shares); and (ii)&#160;the total amount of shares Musk would receive based on his March&#160;2017 request for an award of 15% of total outstanding, non-diluted shares (25,217,325 shares). 337 Musk responded on December&#160;1 telling Maron: &#8220;That is more than intended. Let&#8217;s go with 10% of the current FDS number, so 20.915M.&#8221; 338 Musk arrived at this number by multiplying Tesla&#8217;s FDS (fully diluted share) total as of November&#160;2017 by 10%, or by factoring in dilution on a pre-grant basis. &#8203; 326 JX-669 (11/16/17 special Board meeting minutes). 327 JX-670 (11/15/17 email from Chang to Ehrenpreis in advance of a Board meeting the following day). 328 PTO &#182; 133.

He said that the December&#160;1 proposal &#8220;was, I guess, me negotiating against myself.&#8221; 339 4. A Surge Of Activity &#8203; The parties crammed a lot of work into a few days in December. During a five-day period that month, the Compensation Committee met twice (on December&#160;8 and 10), 340 and the Board met once (December&#160;12). 341 There was a renewed sense of urgency after the December&#160;8 meeting, as reflected by email chatter on December&#160;10 and 11&#160;among high-ranking Tesla employees enlisted to work on the Grant. 342 During the December&#160;10 meeting, the Compensation Committee approved a 12-tranche Grant structure and a set of operational milestones. Ehrenpreis reported that Musk &#8220;appeared prepared to accept&#8221; the structure, which the minutes described at the &#8220;lower end of the previously contemplated range of 12% of the total outstanding shares.&#8221; 343 The December&#160;12 meeting minutes also identify other terms under consideration. a. The 12%/12-Tranche Structure &#8203; All pre-November&#160;9 discussions had assumed 15 tranches, in line with Musk&#8217;s proposals. 344 And on November&#160;9, Musk proposed ten tranches measured by fully diluted shares. On December&#160;10, however, the Compensation Committee approved a 12-tranche structure, which was presented to the Board two days later. The parties dispute the evolution of the 12-tranche structure. According to Ehrenpreis, the 12-tranche structure was intended to counter Musk&#8217;s offer for a fully diluted 10% and its corollary ten-tranche structure. 345 This may appear counterintuitive, because 12% of total outstanding shares equals approximately 10% fully diluted&#8212;thus, making it seem like there was no real upside to using the 12% figure. The difference, however, is that adding two more tranches on top of Musk&#8217;s suggested ten tranches required Tesla to hit the $50&#160;billion market capitalization target two more times to generate an additional $100&#160;billion in &#8203; 339 Musk Dep Tr. at 263:2&#8211;4. 340 JX-697 (12/8/17 Compensation Committee meeting minutes); PTO &#182; 229 (noting the Compensation Committee met on 12/10/17). 341 JX-729 (12/12/17 special Board meeting minutes). 342 JX-717 at 1 (12/10/17 email noting the &#8220;importance and the timing on getting&#8221; an analysis of the stock-based compensation effects of the grant &#8220;out quickly&#8221; because of a valuation deadline the next day); id.&#160; (12/11/17 email marked as &#8220;high&#8221; importance stating, &#8220;[w]e are back on with a vengeance (apologies in advance). . . . I am just now digesting myself&#8221;); JX-718 at 1 (12/11/17 email stating that &#8220;[o]ur CEO grant[] is back and on a fast track now&#8221;). 343 JX-729 at 1. 344 See JX-1598 at 3 (15 tranches, 1% of total outstanding shares each); JX-434 at 3 (15&#160;tranches, 1% of total outstanding shares each); JX-445 (15 tranches, 1% of total outstanding shares each); JX-464 at 5&#8211;7; (15 tranches, 1% of total outstanding shares each); JX-486 at 1 (15 tranches, 1% of total outstanding shares each); JX-510 at 12 (15&#160;tranches, varying total outstanding shares awards each); JX-530 at 9, 13 (15 tranches, varying total outstanding shares awards each); JX- 566 at 11, 14 (15 tranches, varying total outstanding shares awards each); JX-640 at 3 (15 tranches); JX-632 at 4 (15 tranches, varying total outstanding shares awards each). One Compensia presentation from September&#160;19 provides &#8220;5 to 10&#8221; tranches as a possible range, but this is clearly an error as the rest of the presentation, including the slide where this range appears, assumes an award with 15 tranches. See JX-628 at 6. Ehrenpreis&#8217;s testimony that &#8220;5 to 10 . . . was the range of the number of tranches that was being considered at that time&#8221; is not credible, and he acknowledged on redirect that the rest of the presentation envisioned 15 tranches. Trial Tr. at 51:18&#8211;24, 214:20&#8211;215:6 (Ehrenpreis). 345 Trial Tr. at 58:15&#8211;59:11 (Ehrenpreis) (&#8220;And essentially&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and getting him to agree to the total outstanding share framework, we added two more vesting tranches, which would have required, for him to achieve the equivalent in number of shares, $100&#160;billion market cap more.&#8221;). &#160; I-33 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; market capitalization. 346 So, the 12-tranche structure made it harder for Musk to achieve the maximum payout of the Grant. Musk testified that the shift from fully diluted to total outstanding shares was one of &#8220;two areas . . . where the board pushed significantly, which I conceded[.]&#8221; 347 This testimony, however, finds no support in the contemporaneous record. Although there are benefits of a 12-tranche structure to minority stockholders, the move to 12% and 12 tranches was driven by the Board&#8217;s preference to base the Grant on total outstanding shares rather than fully diluted shares. The issue first arose during the November&#160;16 Board meeting. There, the Board discussed a move from Musk&#8217;s proposed fully diluted shares to the Board&#8217;s preferred total outstanding shares. 348 The Board viewed total outstanding shares as a simpler metric and had used it when issuing the 2012 Grant. 349 On December&#160;10, the Compensation Committee held a special meeting to discuss the Grant. 350 There are no minutes for the December&#160;10 meeting. Chang attended and took notes, which he circulated by email later that evening. 351 His notes state: Todd Introduction/led discussion re review of terms o We seem to be at the right place as far as size: 10% of FDS (~12% of TOS) o #of tranches? Simplicity of 10 10 means that the end goal is smaller Agreed to 12 tranches of 1% each. 352 Translating the above, the Board agreed to the size demanded by Musk but preferred to base it on total outstanding shares, consistent with their discussion during the November&#160;16 meeting. With his meeting notes, Chang indicated that he would &#8220;send another email shortly with the grant size numbers.&#8221; 353 A few minutes later, he sent an email to the same people attaching a spreadsheet and stating the following: Contemplated size of grant is here. Details attached. This is based on 12% of total outstanding shares (TOS as of 11/8, should update to close to grant, but this should still get us very close). Grant size would be 20,173,860 shares. &#8226; &#8201;12% of TOS &#8203; 346 Where each tranche is 1%, and there is a $50&#160;billion market capitalization target per tranche, adding two tranches increases the total market capitalization goal by $50&#160;billion&#160;x 2 = $100&#160;billion. 347 Id. at 584:9&#8211;19 (Musk). The other area was the Five-Year Hold Period, discussed below. 348 JX-669 (noting the Board &#8220;expressed a general preference&#8221; for a non-diluted award and a structure of &#8220;1% of current total outstanding shares as the award for each vesting tranche&#8221; accompanied by $50&#160;billion market capitalization increases and a &#8220;matching operational milestone&#8221;). 349 Maron Dep. Tr. at 407:17&#8211;25 (stating that the Board used total outstanding shares, instead of fully diluted shares, because &#8220;it was a simpler approach&#8221;); JX-135 at 77 (showing 2012 Grant using total outstanding shares as well). The 2009 Grant used a diluted approach. JX-68 at 2&#8211;3. 350 PTO &#182; 229. 351 JX-701. 352 Id. &#160;&#160;&#160;There is some indication that the 12-tranche structure was being considered prior to this meeting. On December&#160;6, Ahuja circulated a spreadsheet concerning operational milestones to Chang and Maron. That spreadsheet reflected a 12-tranche structure, suggesting that Ahuja, Chang, and Maron had discussed this possibility prior to that time. JX-688. 353 JX-701. &#160; I-34 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; &#8226; &#8201;9.8% of FDS 354 On December&#160;11, Ahuja emailed Chang and Tesla&#8217;s corporate controller to confirm that the 2018 Grant would award 20,173,860 shares (12% of total outstanding or 9.8% of fully diluted) over 12 tranches. 355 On December&#160;12, Ehrenpreis told the Board that Musk was prepared to accept this Grant size. 356 There is no discussion in any of the minutes or notes of the November&#160;16, or December&#160;8, 10, or 12 meetings indicating that the Board desired 12 tranches because it was better for the minority stockholders. To the contrary, the only explanation in the record for the 12-tranche structure is that the Board preferred to measure the Grant by total outstanding shares for simplicity&#8217;s sake. There is also no evidence that the Board pushed for the 12%/12-tranche structure. Maron did not recall the Board pushing or Musk conceding anything. He testified that although &#8220;the size of the overall plan&#8221; was one of the features that was &#8220;different than I think were initially thought of by Elon . . . I don&#8217;t want to say that it was necessarily over his objection.&#8221; 357 Reinforcing the similarity between Musk&#8217;s 10% fully diluted ask and the Board&#8217;s 12% total outstanding offer, Musk confused the two at trial, mistakenly testifying that the Grant awarded &#8220;10&#160;percent.&#8221; 358 b. The Operational Milestones &#8203; During the November&#160;16 Board meeting, the Board &#8220;discussed the structure of the operational milestones,&#8221; came to a consensus to use both sales and profits metrics, and &#8220;directed the Compensation Committee and management to develop operational milestones&#8221; using revenue and EBITDA. 359 Ahuja and his team took up the mantle. On December&#160;7 and 8, Ahuja developed a number of alternatives using a comparatively low 10% EBITDA/revenue margin. 360 By December&#160;10, Ahuja had refined the model to three options for six, eight, or 12 of each of revenue and adjusted EBITDA milestones, all at a 10% EBITDA/ &#8203; revenue margin. 361 Recall that, in September&#160;2017, Tesla sought to develop achievable operational milestones and analyzed information regarding the adjusted EBITDA/revenue ratios certain peers ( e.g. , Amazon (8%), Apple (34%), and Google (42%)). 362 The 10% EBITDA/revenue ratio modeled by Ahuja, therefore, was comparatively low and thus easier to achieve. 363 Tesla ultimately based the Grant&#8217;s EBITDA milestones on an 8% EBITDA/revenue margin, 364 making them even easier to achieve. 365 &#8203; 354 JX-702. 355 JX-715. 356 JX-729 (12/12/17 special Board meeting minutes). 357 Maron Dep Tr. at 428:20&#8211;430:3. 358 Trial Tr. at 581:13&#8211;582:6 (Musk) (&#8220;Q.

He &#8220;started with&#8221; the $50&#160;billion market capitalization milestones and backed into the revenue and EBITDA targets. 366 Chang&#160;similarly explained that the operational and market capitalization milestones &#8220;have to be somewhat aligned. It has to make sense to be able to be achieved around the same time or what you think is the same time.&#8221; 367 So to establish the operational milestones, the Working Group asked: &#8220;at this valuation what would . . . revenue and EBITDA look like . . . ?&#8221; 368 During the December&#160;12 meeting, the Board also reviewed Tesla&#8217;s then-current operating plan and projections. 369 Ahuja developed, and Musk approved, the projections in December prior to the meeting (the &#8220;December&#160;2017 Projections&#8221;). 370 The one-year projections underlying the operating plan forecasted $27.4B in total revenue and $4.3B in adjusted EBITDA by late 2018, and thus predicted achievement of three milestones in 2018 alone. 371 The three-year long-run projections (&#8220;LRP&#8221;) underlying that plan reflected that, by 2019 and 2020, Tesla would achieve seven and eleven operational milestones, respectively. 372 The following chart reflects the corollaries: &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Revenue &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Adjusted EBITDA &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 2017 3-Yr LRP &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; The Grant &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 2017 3-Yr LRP &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; FY2018 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $27.5B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $20B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $1.5B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $3.8B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; FY2019 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $41.9B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $35B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $3B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $8.1B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; FY2020 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $69.6B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $55B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $4.5B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $14.4B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $75B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $6B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $100B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $8B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $125B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $10B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $150B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $12B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $175B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $14B &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; F.

The Leadership Requirement &#8203; The December&#160;13 Term Sheet reflected agreement on a &#8220;Leadership Requirement,&#8221; conditioning vesting under the Grant on Musk being &#8220;CEO or Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer[.]&#8221; 374 The 2012 Grant contained a stricter Leadership Requirement, which conditioned vesting on Musk remaining CEO. 375 The Board materials for the September&#160;19 meeting&#160;reflect that the Board considered a Leadership Requirement similar to that in&#160;the&#160;2012 Grant. 376 At some point between September&#160;19 and December&#160;13, the Board&#160;relaxed its request to allow vesting if Musk was not CEO but was Executive&#160;Chairman and Chief Product Officer. 377 There is no indication how or when the decision was made, whether it was raised with Musk, or when the term was finalized, but it appears in the final Grant. At trial, Gracias explained that the more lenient Leadership Requirement reflected the Board&#8217;s belief that Musk&#8217;s &#8220;most valuable function[]&#8221; was as the &#8220;chief product officer,&#8221; not as the CEO. 378 There is no evidence that the Board ever discussed or negotiated this with Musk. 2. The M&amp;A Adjustment &#8203; The December&#160;13 Term Sheet reflected the Board&#8217;s intent to include an M&amp;A Adjustment in the Grant. 379 The 2018 Grant included an M&amp;A Adjustment, which had been under discussion since at least the June&#160;23 Compensation Committee meeting. 380 In its final form, the M&amp;A Adjustment excluded from the market capitalization milestone acquisitions with a purchase price over $1&#160;billion, and the revenue and adjusted EBITDA milestones excluded amounts attributable to acquisitions providing more than $500&#160;million or $100&#160;million of each, respectively. 381 At trial, Ehrenpreis described this as a negotiated term, testifying that Musk wanted &#8220;the M&amp;A adjustments just to apply to a single milestone at the point of M&amp;A, and we&#160;ultimately got those adjustments to apply across the entire basis of the&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;of all the milestones.&#8221; 382 Ehrenpreis was referring to a January&#160;16 demand from Musk to Maron that the M&amp;A Adjustment threshold be 5% of the then-current market capitalization rather than a flat $5&#160;billion. 383 Musk also told Maron that adjusting the revenue and adjusted EBITDA milestones would be too complicated and unnecessary. 384 Musk, however, would eventually come around to the M&amp;A Adjustment as proposed by the Board and even suggested stricter terms. After speaking to Ahuja, on January&#160;16, Maron proposed a threshold that would exclude acquisition-based market capitalization growth amounting to the lesser of (i)&#160;5% market capitalization at the time of &#8203; 374 Id. at 4&#8211;5. 375 JX-137 at 1 (2012 Grant). 376 Id. ; JX-633 at 9 (&#8220;Based on the 2012 Award, should the Company continue to require Mr.&#160;Musk to be CEO in order to continue vesting under the new award?&#8221;). 377 JX-878 at 52 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). 378 Trial Tr. at 726:4&#8211;15 (Gracias). 379 JX-743 at 4&#8211;5. 380 JX-475 at 6. 381 JX-878 at 19 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). 382 Trial Tr. at 227:9&#8211;13 (Ehrenpreis); see id. at 63:5&#8211;15 (Ehrenpreis) (&#8220;We further negotiated the idea of creating adjustments to both the revenue and EBITDA and market cap numbers if there was M&amp;A that caused &#8212; if, through acquisition, either the market cap or those financial metrics increased.

The Hold Period &#8203; The December&#160;13 Term Sheet reflected that the duration of the Hold Period was an open issue. 389 The December&#160;13 Term Sheet stated that the Hold Period was &#8220;likely to be 5&#160;years,&#8221; but it was still uncertain. 390 The 2018 Grant included the Five-Year Hold Period. At trial, Ehrenpreis described the Five-Year Hold Period as a negotiated term. 391 Musk similarly testified that the Board &#8220;pushed&#8221; for this term, which was his &#8220;biggest concern, because it would mean that either [he] would need to run the company for another five&#160;years after the stock vested or [he] would need to find someone who would run the company well enough to not cause the valuation to subsequently decline significantly. . . . A lot can happen in five&#160;years.&#8221; 392 But there is nothing in the record reflecting any actual negotiation with Musk over this term. The only explanation in the record for a five-year period came in July, when Ehrenpreis raised the possibility as a &#8220;creative option[]&#8221; for &#8220;getting a bigger discount[]&#8221; on the publicly disclosed value of the Grant. 393 4.

He then applied a 10.52% illiquidity discount based on the Five-Year Hold Period, arriving at a final value of $2,377,077,626. 398 Burg and Ahuja&#8217;s team continued to refine this valuation in the following weeks by tweaking assumptions, including the holding period and dilution rate. 399 Burg provided an updated valuation letter on January&#160;19. 400 This letter included a slightly higher final valuation of $2,575,342,854 (again taking into account the holding period illiquidity discount) compared to the December&#160;22 valuation of $2,377,077,626. 401 Another updated letter, dated January&#160;21, provided a still higher final valuation of $2,615,190,052, resulting from intervening increases in the total number of shares, a higher stock price, and slight changes to other assumptions. 402 G. The Board Approves The Grant. &#8203; On January&#160;21, 2018, the Board held a special meeting to approve the 2018 Grant. 403 Musk and Kimbal recused themselves and Jurvetson was on leave. 404 The other six directors&#8212;Ehrenpreis, Denholm, Gracias, Buss, Murdoch, and Johnson Rice&#8212;unanimously approved the 2018 Grant. 405 &#8203; 395 See id. at 5, 11 (describing the Monte Carlo simulation method and showing formula). 396 Id. at 12. 397 See id. at 4&#8211;5. 398 Id. at 6&#8211;9. 399 See JX-767 at 1&#8211;4; JX-772 at 1&#8211;2. 400 JX-785 at 1&#8211;2. 401 Compare JX-785 at 10, with , JX-752 at 6&#8211;9. 402 JX-792 at 7; JX-799 at 3. 403 See PTO &#182;&#182; 231&#8211;33. 404 JX-791 at 1 (1/21/18 special Board meeting minutes). 405 Id. at 1&#8211;2. &#160; I-39 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; In its final form, the 2018 Grant is divided into 12 vesting tranches. 406 Each tranche&#160;vests upon satisfaction of one market capitalization milestone and achievement of&#160;one operational milestone. 407 The 12 market capitalization milestones increase in&#160;$50&#160;billion increments, beginning at $100&#160;billion and ending at $650&#160;billion. 408 The&#160;2018&#160;Grant&#160;has&#160;&#160;16&#160;operational milestones: eight based on revenue and eight&#160;based&#160;on&#160;adjusted&#160;EBITDA. 409 &#160;For each tranche to vest, the achievement of any one of the operational milestones can be paired with achievement of any one of the market capitalization milestones. 410 The increments of the operational milestones are shown in the table below. 411 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Revenue-Based Operational Milestones (in billions) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Adjusted EBITDA-Based Operational Milestones (in billions) &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 1 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $20.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $1.5 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 2 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $35.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $3.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 3 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $55.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $4.5 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 4 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $75.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $6.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 5 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $100.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $8.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 6 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $125.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $10.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 7 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $150.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $12.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 8 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $175.0 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $14.0 &#8203; &#8203; To complete each tranche, the Grant requires that Tesla achieve one market capitalization milestone and one operational milestone. 412 Each completed tranche earns Musk options to purchase 1% of Tesla&#8217;s common stock outstanding as of January&#160;19, 2018. Before a five-for-one stock split in 2020 and a three-for-one stock split in 2022, this 1% was equivalent to 1,688,670 shares. 413 If fully vested, the 2018 Grant would therefore grant Musk options to purchase 20,264,042 (pre-split) shares. 414 The strike price of these options was $350.02, the closing price of Tesla&#8217;s common stock on January&#160;19, 2018. 415 Adjusting for Tesla&#8217;s two stock splits, the strike price was $23.33. 416 &#8203; 406 PTO &#182; 238. 407 Id. 408 See id. &#182; 241.

The Stockholders Approve The Grant. &#8203; Board approval was not the finish line, because the Board conditioned the 2018 Grant on approval by a majority vote of disinterested stockholders. 418 1. The Proxy Statement &#8203; Tesla announced the 2018 Grant to the public and filed a preliminary proxy statement on January&#160;23, 2018. 419 Tesla filed its definitive proxy statement (the &#8220;Proxy&#8221;) on February&#160;8, which notified stockholders of a vote to approve the 2018 Grant on March&#160;21, 2018. 420 The Proxy included statements at issue in this litigation. It described all Compensation&#160;Committee members as &#8220;independent directors,&#8221; despite Gracias&#8217;s close relationship with Musk. 421 The Proxy did not disclose the financial or personal connections between the members of the Compensation Committee and Musk. The Proxy did not disclose the April&#160;9 conversation between Musk and Ehrenpreis, during which Musk established the key terms of the 2018 Grant. A discussion of this conversation appeared in at least four earlier drafts of the Proxy. 422 In its final form, the Proxy states: With the 2012 Performance Award nearing completion, the Board engaged in more than six&#160;months of active and ongoing discussions regarding a new compensation program for Mr.&#160;Musk, ultimately concluding in its decision to grant the CEO Performance Award. These discussions first took place among the members of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the &#8216; Compensation Committee &#8217;), all of whom are independent directors, and then with the Board&#8217;s other independent directors, including its two newest independent directors, Linda Johnson Rice and James Murdoch. 423 The Proxy stated that: &#8220;each of the requirements underlying the performance milestones was selected to be very difficult to achieve&#8221;; 424 the Board &#8220;based this new award&#160;on stretch goals&#8221;; 425 the Grant&#8217;s milestones were &#8220;ambitious&#8221; and &#8220;challenging&#8221;; 426 &#160;&#8220;[l]ike&#160;the Revenue milestones described above, the Adjusted EBITDA milestones are designed to be challenging&#8221;; 427 and &#8220;[t]he Board considers the Market Capitalization Milestones to be challenging hurdles.&#8221; 428 The Proxy disclosed that, when setting the milestones, &#8220;the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla&#8217;s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth &#8203; 417 JX-878 at 52 (stating that the Grant expires on January&#160;20, 2028); JX-137 at 1. 418 PTO &#182; 233; JX-791 at 4&#8211;5. 419 PTO &#182; 234. 420 Id. &#182; 235; see also JX-878 at 29. 421 JX-878 at 10.

During July&#160;2017, Tesla updated its internal three-year financial projections (&#8220;July&#160;2017 Projections&#8221;). 431 The&#160;July&#160;2017 Projections reflected that the S-curve&#8217;s exponential growth phase was&#160;imminent. 432 Tesla shared the July&#160;2017 Projections, which the Audit Committee&#160;approved, 433 with S&amp;P&#160;and Moody&#8217;s in connection with a debt offering. 434 The 2017 Projections showed revenue growth of $69.6B and adjusted EBITDA growth of $14.4B in 2020. 435 Under the July&#160;2017 Projections, Tesla would achieve three of the revenue milestones and all of the adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2020. The Proxy did not disclose this. Ahuja developed and Musk approved a new operating plan and projections in December&#8212;the December&#160;2017 Projections. 436 As discussed above, the Board reviewed those projections on December&#160;12. 437 The one-year projections underlying the operating plan forecasted $27.4B in revenue and $4.3B in EBITDA by late 2018, and thus predicted achievement of three milestones in 2018 alone. 438 The longer three-year projections underlying that plan reflected that by 2019 and 2020, Tesla would achieve seven and eleven operational milestones, respectively. 439 The Proxy did not disclose this. After Tesla issued the Proxy, but before the stockholder vote, Ahuja presented the Board with a three-year operating plan (the &#8220;March&#160;2018 Projections&#8221;), which Tesla later shared with Moody&#8217;s. 440 Musk reviewed and approved the March&#160;2018 Projections before they were presented to the Board. 441 The March&#160;2018 Projections were more pessimistic than previous projections but still predicted achievement of one revenue and two adjusted EBITDA milestones by March&#160;31, 2019, and further two revenue and four adjusted EBITDA milestones by the end of 2020. 442 As discussed below, Tesla would issue a supplemental disclosure with this information, but not until after the stockholder vote. &#8203; 429 Id. at 18. 430 Trial Tr. at 481:14&#8211;481:24 (Ahuja). 431 JX-529 at 2.

The Public Reaction &#8203; Tesla tracked support and opposition to the 2018 Grant among stockholders and engaged in outreach. 443 The two largest proxy advisors, ISS and Glass Lewis, both recommended voting against the 2018 Grant. 444 Glass Lewis expressed concern with the size and potential dilutive effect of the grant, noting that &#8220;any relative comparison of the grant&#8217;s size would be akin to stacking nickels against dollars[]&#8221;and that &#8220;the lower tiers of the goals are relatively much more attainable given the time periods in question, potentially allowing for sizable payments without commensurately exceptional achievement.&#8221; 445 ISS described the grant value as &#8220;staggering&#8221; and concluded that even the &#8220;challenging&#8221; and &#8220;far-reaching performance goals do not justify the extraordinary grant magnitude[.]&#8221; 446 In an internal email, ISS noted that it &#8220;steered clear of getting too deep into this[]&#8221; because &#8220;making that argument essentially puts us in the situation of saying Tesla&#8217;s board is not strong enough to stand up to Musk[.]&#8221; 447 &#8203; 443 See JX-901 at 3&#8211;7. 444 JX-987 at 6 (3/21/18 ISS proxy analysis &amp; benchmark policy voting recommendations); JX-931 at 7 (3/6/18 Glass Lewis proxy paper on Tesla). 445 JX-931 at 5, 7. 446 JX-987 at 3, 6.

They are not welcome.&#8221; 457 It appears that a non-Musk employee at Tesla called that stockholder after the vote. 458 3. The Stockholder Vote &#8203; The stockholders approved the Grant at a special stockholder meeting on March&#160;21, 2018, with 73% of votes cast at the meeting (excluding Musk&#8217;s and Kimbal&#8217;s ownership) in favor. 459 I. Subsequent Events &#8203; Events relevant to evaluating the fairness of the Grant occurred after stockholders approved the Grant. Namely, Tesla disclosed that several Grant milestones were greater than 70% probable of achievement, nearly all the tranches vested, Musk got in trouble with the SEC, named himself Technoking, and acquired Twitter, Inc. 1.

They were used to drive and motivate rather than plan, and Tesla frequently missed its projections. 466 They reflected what Tesla would need to do to reach aggressive goals set by Musk. 467 Tesla based the March disclosures on the March&#160;2018 Projections. Ahuja described the March&#160;2018 Projections as &#8220;extremely aggressive and challenging&#8221; based on &#8220;stretch goals&#8221; and &#8220;very large . . . risks[.] 468 Yet Tesla disclosed that &#8220;the following performance milestones were considered probable of achievement: total revenue of $20.0&#160;billion; adjusted EBITDA of $1.5&#160;billion; and adjusted EBITDA of $3.0&#160;billion.&#8221; 469 The March&#160;31 10-Q&#160;included the usual disclaimer, stating that &#8220;[t]he probability of meeting an operational milestone is based on a subjective assessment of our future financial projections.&#8221; 470 According to Ahuja, this disclosure meant that &#8220;the three operational milestones . . . are 70&#160;percent probable of achievement in the late 2018 and 2019 time frame.&#8221; 471 Ahuja characterized the probability assessment as an inherently &#8220;conservative approach&#8221; from an accounting perspective. 472 Still, it is not clear how Tesla management reconciled their views that the milestones were both &#8220;risky&#8221; and a &#8220;stretch&#8221; yet simultaneously more than 70% likely to occur. Regardless, management stuck to its guns. On April&#160;3, Ahuja told his team that &#8220;to be consistent in our methodology of using the operating plan of record, we should assume that the second EBITDA milestone has greater than 70% chance of vesting by 6/30/2019.&#8221; 473 And an Audit Committee presentation dated April&#160;27, 2018 indicated that, based on the March&#160;2018 Projections, Tesla considered the $20&#160;billion revenue milestone and the $1.5&#160;billion adjusted EBITDA milestone more than 70% likely by December&#160;31, 2018, and the $3&#160;billion adjusted &#8203; 461 See JX-990 at 1; JX-1004 at 1; JX-1019 at 2; JX-1011 (3/31/18 Form 10-Q for Q1). 462 JX-1011 at 27. 463 JX-1019 at 2; Trial Tr. at 743:11-23 (Gracias) (&#8220;[T]here&#8217;s only one plan. . . .

The SEC Settlement &#8203; On September&#160;29, 2018, the SEC announced that it had reached a settlement with Musk over fraud charges stemming from a tweet he sent in August&#160;2018. 480 As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to pay a penalty of $20&#160;million, resign as Chair of the Tesla Board, submit communications relating to the company for pre-approval subject to procedures implemented by Tesla, and not &#8220;make . . . any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the complaint is without factual basis[.]&#8221; 481 Tesla also agreed to add two new independent directors and create a permanent committee of independent directors charged with overseeing implementation of the settlement, controls regarding Tesla&#8217;s public statements, and the &#8220;review and resolution of human resources issues or conflict of interest issues&#8221; involving Tesla&#8217;s management. 482 On April&#160;30, 2019, the final judgment enshrining the SEC Settlement was amended to clarify that Musk must &#8220;obtain the pre-approval of an experienced securities lawyer employed by the company (&#8216;Securities Counsel&#8217;) of any written communication that contains information regarding&#8221; a long list of topics, including Tesla&#8217;s finances, its non-public projections, and &#8220;events regarding the Company&#8217;s securities.&#8221; 483 &#8203; 474 JX-1023 at 6. 475 JX-1031 at 27 (5/7/18 Form 10-Q for Q1). 476 Trial Tr. at 479:6&#8211;21 (Ahuja). 477 PTO &#182;&#182; 265&#8211;71. 478 Id. &#182;&#182; 272&#8211;75. 479 Id. &#182; 276. 480 JX-1070 at 1 (9/29/18 SEC Press Release: Elon Musk Settles SEC Fraud Charges; Tesla Charged With and Resolves Securities Law Charge).

Then Came Twitter &#8203; On April&#160;25, 2022, Twitter, Inc. and Musk announced the execution of a merger agreement in which Musk would acquire Twitter. 502 Musk subsequently sought to terminate the merger agreement, and Twitter sued for specific enforcement. 503 The amount of time Musk spent on the Twitter acquisition was undoubtedly a concern at Tesla. Also, in the Twitter litigation, Musk filed a pleading affirming that no one at Tesla is authorized to view his Tesla email accounts without his consent, except to the extent legally required. 504 Musk ultimately acquired Twitter and named himself &#8220;chief twit,&#8221; a role analogous to CEO. 505 Musk also testified that he asked approximately 50 Tesla engineers to &#8220;volunteer&#8221; to help him evaluate Twitter&#8217;s engineering team. 506 No one on the Board called Musk to tell him not to do this. 507 In the weeks prior to trial, Musk spent the &#8220;lion&#8217;s share&#8221; of his time at Twitter. 508 J. This Litigation &#8203; Plaintiff Richard Tornetta (&#8220;Plaintiff&#8221;), a Tesla stockholder, filed his complaint on June&#160;5, 2018. 509 His original complaint asserted four counts: Count I for breach of fiduciary duty against Musk in his capacity as a then-controlling stockholder; Count II for breach of fiduciary duty against Musk, Kimbal, Gracias, Jurvetson, Ehrenpreis, Buss, Denholm, Murdoch, and Johnson Rice as directors (together, &#8220;Defendants&#8221;); Count III for unjust enrichment against Musk; and Count IV for waste. 510 Counts I and II were asserted as both direct and derivative claims. Counts&#160;III and IV were asserted as derivative claims. 511 Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court denied the motion as to Counts I through III, dismissing only the waste claim. 512 For purposes of the motion to dismiss, Defendants conceded that Musk controlled Tesla. 513 Defendants argued that the stockholder vote approving the Grant qualified as a ratifying vote justifying business judgment deference under Section&#160;216 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#8220;DGCL&#8221;). 514 &#8203; 500 Id. at 25:13&#8211;22. 501 Trial Tr. at 599:4&#8211;10 (Musk); but see id. at 1085:1&#8211;7 (Kimbal) (&#8220;Question: Have you heard the word &#8216;Technoking&#8217; before?

Rossette 519 and thus eliminated the legal basis for the dual-natured Counts I and II. 520 Brookfield determined that fiduciary duty claims alleging overpayment or dilution of voting power are categorically derivative, rather than dual-natured, even when asserted against a controlling stockholder. 521 As a result of Brookfield , Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend his complaint on September&#160;30, 2021. 522 The proposed amended complaint asserted the same claims as the original complaint, but asserted Counts&#160;I and II as entirely derivative rather than dual-natured. 523 The next day, Plaintiff and Defendants Kimbal and Jurvetson cross-moved for summary judgment. 524 Plaintiff argued that the 2018 Grant was invalid because it was conditioned on stockholder approval, but that the Proxy failed to disclose material information. For instance, Plaintiff argued that Tesla failed to disclose how achievable Tesla&#160;management thought the milestones were, or to fully appraise stockholders of&#160;the&#160;close&#160;professional and personal relationships Ehrenpreis and Gracias each had with Musk. 525 Kimbal and Jurvetson moved for summary judgment on all Counts on the grounds that they had minimal or non-existent roles in the 2018 Grant process. 526 While these motions were pending, on October&#160;27, 2021, the parties stipulated to decertify the class, dismiss the direct claim components of Counts I and II, and to voluntarily dismiss all claims against Kimbal and Jurvetson with prejudice. 527 The stipulation preserved Plaintiff&#8217;s motion for leave to file the amended complaint to change the action from a direct to a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule&#160;23.1. 528 Collectively, those moves averted the Gentile issue at the heart of the original complaint. The court granted the stipulation on October&#160;27, 2021. 529 The remaining Defendants sought summary judgment on November&#160;19, 2021, advancing a ratification theory on the basis that Tesla stockholders received all material information ahead of the vote. 530 &#8203; 515 Id. at 807&#8211;09. 516 Id. at 810&#8211;12. 517 Id. at 812&#8211;13. 518 Dkt. 94. 519 906 A.2d 91 (Del. 2006). 520 261 A.3d 1251. 521 Id. at 1275. 522 Dkt. 161. 523 Dkt. 161, Ex.

The court requested supplemental briefing in a letter to counsel dated February&#160;22. 539 The parties completed supplemental briefing on April&#160;11. 540 II. LEGAL ANALYSIS &#8203; Plaintiff claims that awarding the Grant constituted a breach of fiduciary duty. 541 He argues that the entire fairness standard governs for two independent reasons&#8212;because the Grant was a conflicted-controller transaction and, separately, because the Grant was approved by a majority conflicted Board. He further argues that Defendants failed to demonstrate that the Grant was fair, and that the court should invalidate and rescind the Grant either in its entirety or in part. Defendants dispute that the entire fairness standard applies and argue that, if entire fairness applies, Plaintiff bears the burden of proof because the stockholder vote was fully informed. This analysis proceeds in four parts. The court first addresses the gating issue&#8212;the standard of review&#8212;and concludes that entire fairness applies because Musk exercised control over the Grant. The court next addresses Defendants&#8217; argument that the stockholder vote shifted the burden under the entire fairness standard to Plaintiff, concluding that Defendants retain the burden because the stockholder vote was not fully informed. The court then evaluates the Grant under the entire fairness standard, concluding that Defendants failed to prove that the Grant was entirely fair. The court last turns to the remedy, concluding that Plaintiff is entitled to rescission of the Grant in its entirety. &#8203; 531 Dkt. 199. 532 Dkt. 206. 533 Dkt. 207. 534 See id. at 2. 535 Dkt. 209. 536 Dkt. 219.

The letter specified the following topics for supplemental briefing: (i)&#160;whether a material omission in the Proxy invalidates the Grant; (ii)&#160;whether focusing on the give-get exchange within an entire fairness fair price analysis is an accurate framing of the inquiry, as Defendants asserted; (iii)&#160;whether disclosures about the Grant development process are unlikely to be material here because the key economic terms were fully disclosed; and (iv)&#160;any responses to the amicus brief filed by Professor Charles M. Elson to aid the court in understanding the origin and purpose of equity-linked compensation and how it relates to the Grant here.

Br.&#8221;). 541 Plaintiff asserts a derivative claim and, typically, litigation of a derivative claim would begin with an assessment of whether the plaintiff met the demand requirement. Demand futility is a gating issue that must be raised (and, in this jurist&#8217;s view, should only be raised) at the pleading stage. See generally In re McDonald&#8217;s Corp. S&#8217;holder Deriv. Litig., 291 A.3d 652, 699&#8211;700 (Del. Ch. 2023) (&#8220;The defendants generally should expect one bite at the demand-futility apple.&#8221;). In this case, however, Defendants did not argue demand futility at the pleading stage due to this court&#8217;s decision in another action involving Tesla. See SolarCity I , 2018 WL 1560293, at *17&#8211;19 (holding that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that demand was excused with respect to a majority of the Tesla Board). &#160; I-50 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; A. The Entire Fairness Standard Applies Because Musk Is A Controller. &#8203; When determining whether corporate fiduciaries have breached their duties, a court applying Delaware law evaluates the fiduciaries&#8217; conduct through a standard of review. 542 Delaware law has three levels of transactional standards of review: business judgment, enhanced scrutiny, and entire fairness. 543 Plaintiff argues that Delaware&#8217;s most onerous standard of review, entire fairness, applies because the Grant was a conflicted-controller transaction. 544 Alternatively, Plaintiff argues that entire fairness applies because half of the directors who approved the Grant lacked independence from Musk. 545 Plaintiff wins on the first argument&#8212; &#8203; Musk is a controller. Because Plaintiff wins on the first argument, the court does not address the second argument. 546 Delaware law imposes fiduciary duties on those who control a corporation. 547 Why? Because fiduciary duties exist in part to minimize agency costs caused by the divide between economic ownership and legal control. 548 Delaware law vests control over a corporation in a board of directors and imposes attendant fiduciary obligations on the board as a consequence. 549 When a controller displaces or neutralizes a board&#8217;s power to direct corporate action, then the controller assumes fiduciary obligations. 550 The most straightforward way for a plaintiff to demonstrate control is to show that a defendant holds a mathematical majority of the corporation&#8217;s voting power. 551 This is so because the DGCL requires stockholder approval of transformational transactions. 552 The DGCL also permits stockholder action by written consent, through which a majority stockholder can remove directors and fill vacancies. 553 &#8220;A stockholder who owns a mathematical majority of the corporation&#8217;s voting power,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;has the ability to exercise affirmative control&#8221; &#8203; 542 See Chen v. Howard-Anderson , 87 A.3d 648, 666 (Del. Ch. 2014); In re Trados Inc. S&#8217;holder Litig. , 73 A.3d 17, 35&#8211;36 (Del. Ch. 2013). 543 Chen , 87 A.3d at 666 (quoting Reis v.

Although a showing of &#8220;general control&#8221; is sufficient to establish fiduciary status, a plaintiff can establish fiduciary status by demonstrating that the defendant controlled the particular transaction at issue, referred to as &#8220;transaction-specific&#8221; control. 558 To establish general control, a plaintiff must show &#8220;that a defendant or group of defendants exercised sufficient influence &#8216;that they, as a practical matter, are no differently situated than if they had majority voting control.&#8217;&#8221; 559 &#8220;One means of doing so is to show that the defendant, &#8216;as a practical matter, possesses a combination of stock voting power and managerial authority that enables him to control the corporation, if he so wishes.&#8217;&#8221; 560 The analysis of effective control looks to a stockholders&#8217; ability to exert influence as a stockholder, in the boardroom, and outside of the boardroom through managerial roles. Breaking these categories down to &#8220;indicia of effective control,&#8221; the factors include: &#8226; &#8220;ownership of a significant equity stake (albeit less than a majority),&#8221; &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;the right to designate directors (albeit less than a majority),&#8221; &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;decisional rules in governing documents that enhance the power of a minority stockholder or board-level position,&#8221; and &#8203; &#8226; &#8220;the ability to exercise outsized influence in the board room, such as through high-status roles like CEO, Chairman, or founder.&#8221; 561 &#8203; To establish transaction-specific control, a plaintiff must show that the stockholder &#8220;exercise[d] actual control over the board of directors during the course of a particular transaction[.]&#8221; 562 This analysis often focuses on relationships &#8220;with key managers or advisors who play a critical role in presenting options, providing information, and making recommendations[.]&#8221; 563 It can also address &#8220;the exercise of contractual rights to channel the corporation into a particular outcome by blocking or restricting other paths,&#8221; and &#8220;commercial relationships,&#8221; although those factors are less relevant here. 564 Ultimately, &#8220;[i]t is impossible to identify or foresee all of the possible sources of influence that could contribute to a finding of actual control over a particular decision.&#8221; 565 Both general control and transaction-specific control call for a holistic evaluation of&#160;sources of influence. &#8220;Rarely (if ever) will any one source of influence or indication&#160;of&#160;control, standing alone, be sufficient to make the &#8203; absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary&#8221;); Rosenthal v.

To streamline the sprawling set of issues presented, this analysis addresses whether Musk held transaction-specific control with respect to the Grant. Because &#8220;[b]roader indicia of effective control also play a role in evaluating whether a defendant exercised actual control over a decision[,]&#8221; 570 the sources of influence identified by Plaintiff in support of a finding of general control factor into the transaction-specific analysis. Plaintiff&#8217;s argument that Musk controls Tesla might conjure a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu . That is because Delaware courts have confronted this precise issue before in a prior lawsuit challenging Tesla&#8217;s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity when Musk was SolarCity&#8217;s largest stockholder and board chair. Although the SolarCity case resulted in three opinions, none of them included a finding concerning Musk&#8217;s status as a controller. In the first, Vice&#160;Chancellor Slights denied the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss where it was reasonably conceivable that Musk controlled Tesla. 571 On a motion to dismiss, however, a court must assume the truth of the plaintiff&#8217;s factual allegations. Accordingly, the Vice Chancellor&#8217;s dismissal decision did not constitute a finding that Musk was a controller. Post-trial, the Vice Chancellor held that even if Musk were a controller so as to trigger entire fairness, the transaction was entirely fair. 572 For this reason, it was unnecessary to make a post-trial finding on whether Musk controlled Tesla. The Vice Chancellor&#8217;s approach dexterously relieved the Delaware Supreme Court from the burden of resolving the issue when affirming the post-trial decision. 573 This question of whether Musk controls Tesla has thus proven evasive. It is as good a time as any to run it to ground. And so, &#8220;[o]nce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.&#8221; 574 The analysis begins by discussing Musk&#8217;s stock ownership, which is a significant but not dispositive indicium of control. The analysis then turns to the factors that play a bigger role in the court&#8217;s conclusion, which are Musk&#8217;s influence over managerial decisions, decision makers, and the process. Musk wielded the maximum influence that a manager can wield over a company. His ties to three of the eight directors (Kimbal, Gracias, and Murdoch) rendered those directors beholden to him; with Musk, they comprised half of the Board (given Jurvetson&#8217;s departure). &#8203; 566 Id. at *28 (citations omitted). 567 Voigt , 2020 WL 614999, at *13. 568 Id. 569 Basho , 2018 WL 3326693, at *28. 570 Id. at *27. 571 SolarCity I , 2018 WL 1560293, at *13 (finding it reasonably conceivable that Musk controlled Tesla due to allegations concerning: Musk&#8217;s ability to influence the stockholder vote through his 21.9% ownership; Musk&#8217;s influence over the board as Tesla&#8217;s visionary, CEO, and chairman; Musk&#8217;s strong connections with members of the board and the fact that a majority of the board was interested in the transaction; and Tesla&#8217;s acknowledgment of Musk&#8217;s control in public filings). 572 SolarCity II , 2022 WL 1237185, at *2. Although the Vice Chancellor found that there were significant flaws in the process that led to the SolarCity acquisition, the court held that &#8220;any control [Musk] may have attempted to wield in connection with the Acquisition was effectively neutralized by a board focused on the bona fides of the Acquisition, with an indisputably independent director leading the way.&#8221; Id. at *33 (citation omitted). In reaching this conclusion, the Vice Chancellor emphasized that the board rebuffed multiple of Musk&#8217;s demands during the process, that Denholm &#8220;emerged as an independent, powerful and positive force during the deal process who doggedly viewed the Acquisition solely through the lens of Tesla and its stockholders,&#8221; and was an &#8220;effective buffer between&#8221; Musk and the conflicted board. Id. at *37&#8211;38. The Vice Chancellor then credited as evidence of a fair price the fully informed stockholder vote, SolarCity&#8217;s unaffected trading price, SolarCity&#8217;s cash flows, the financial advisor&#8217;s fairness opinion, and potential synergies. 573 SolarCity III , 298 A.3d at 699. 574 William Shakespeare, Henry V act 3 sc. 1, lns. 1&#8211;2. &#160; I-54 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The rest of the fiduciaries acted beholden to Musk in the process leading to the Grant, allowing Musk to dictate the timing of the process and the terms of the Grant. Ultimately, the key witnesses said it all&#8212;they were there to cooperate with Musk, not negotiate against him. This unique suite of allegations makes it undeniable that, with respect to the Grant, Musk controlled Tesla. 1. Stock Ownership &#8203; &#8220;All else equal, a relatively larger block size should make an inference of actual control more likely[]&#8221; for a few reasons discussed at length by Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster in&#160; Voigt . 575 This is due in part to quorum requirements and stockholder turnout, which give a 40% block holder the same effective power in most circumstances as the holder of a mathematical majority. 576 Meanwhile, &#8220;stockholders who oppose the blockholder&#8217;s position can only prevail by polling votes at supermajority rates.&#8221; 577 Relatedly, compared to a small blockholder, a large blockholder needs the support of fewer other investors to carry a vote. 578 Musk wields significant influence over Tesla by virtue of his stock holdings. Just prior to the Board&#8217;s approval of the Grant, Musk owned approximately 21.9% of Tesla&#8217;s outstanding common stock. 579 Applying the assumptions used in Voigt , if the holder of a 21.9% block favors a particular outcome, then the holder will win as long as holders of approximately one-in-three shares vote the same way. 580 By contrast, an opponent must garner approximately 71% of the unaffiliated shares to win. It is thus no surprise that this court has found that holders of similar or lesser percentages of stock are controlling stockholders. 581 It is also no surprise that under Section&#160;203 of the DGCL, &#8220;[a] person who is the owner of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of any corporation . . . shall be presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary.&#8221; 582 Nor is it any surprise that the original stockholder rights plan triggered at 20% ownership, or that rights plans now routinely cap ownership at 15% or less, thereby forcing a stockholder to stop short of the 20% figure. 583 At a minimum, a 21.9% holding supplies a powerful &#8220;rhetorical card[] to play in the boardroom.&#8221; 584 For Musk, his significant block operated in conjunction with a supermajority voting&#160;requirement for any amendment to Tesla&#8217;s bylaws governing stockholder meetings,&#160;directors, indemnification rights, and the supermajority voting requirement itself. 585 Assuming an 80% turn-out, Musk needed the support of less than 10% of&#160;the minority stockholders to block a bylaw amendment at a stockholder meeting. By&#160;contrast, a proponent would &#8203; 575 Voigt , 2020 WL 614999, at *17&#8211;19 (emphasis omitted). 576 Id. at *18 (&#8220;[O]nce a quorum is present, the general standard for taking action is the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote. For the election of directors, the general standard is a plurality of the shares present and entitled to vote. Meetings typically attract participation from just under 80% of the outstanding shares. At that level, the holder of a 40% block can deliver the vote needed to prevail at a meeting.&#8221; (citations omitted)). 577 Id. at *18 (citation omitted). For example, &#8220;assuming a meeting where holders with 80% of the voting power turn out, and the standard is a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote . . . if the holder of a 35% block favors a particular outcome at a meeting, then the blockholder will win as long as holders of 1-in-7 shares vote the same way.

Indeed, Musk has been able to do so two separate times. 586 Musk&#8217;s 21.9% block, therefore, gives him a sizable leg-up for stockholder votes generally and the ability to block specific categories of bylaw amendments. The block also gives him great influence in the boardroom. This undoubtedly contributes to his clout and sway. If this case involved a failed bylaw amendment subject to a supermajority vote, then Musk&#8217;s stock holdings would likely prove dispositive to the control analysis. But that is not the situation, so Musk&#8217;s stock holdings must be considered in connection with the other indicia of control. 2. Boardroom And Managerial Supremacy &#8203; &#8220;[T]he ability to exercise outsized influence in the board room[]&#8221;can contribute to a finding of control. 587 Boardroom influence can come in a variety of forms. An individual might hold &#8220;high-status roles like CEO, Chairman, or founder.&#8221; 588 Or an individual might have other key executive or managerial roles. An individual can wield influence if he can interfere with or kibosh management decisions. 589 An individual will have substantial influence if he can replace management. 590 Musk wields considerable power in the boardroom by virtue of his high-status roles and managerial supremacy. Indeed, describing Musk&#8217;s role at Tesla as &#8220;high-status&#8221; 591 would be a dramatic understatement. At relevant times, Musk occupied the most powerful&#160;trifecta of roles within a corporation&#8212;CEO, chair, and founder. He also exercised&#160;managerial authority over all aspects of Tesla and often without regard to Board authority, rendering &#8203; 586 JX-1234 at 25&#8211;26 (5/28/20 Schedule&#160;14A) (noting Tesla&#8217;s successful opposition to the 2014 and 2016 proposals to move to simple majority voting). 587 Basho , 2018 WL 3326693, at *27, n.322 (&#8220;[T]he explicit or implicit threat of retaliation will carry much more weight if it comes from a . . . defendant who controls 25% of the voting power of the company, . . . and serves as Chairman of the Board with the power to call board meetings and set the agenda.&#8221;); see also Cysive , 836 A.2d at 551&#8211;53 (incorporating defendants&#8217; status as CEO and chairman into the control analysis). 588 Basho , 2018 WL 3326683, at *27 (citations omitted); SolarCity I , 2018 WL 1560293, at&#160;*13 (considering for purposes of the control analysis &#8220;Musk&#8217;s influence over the Board as Tesla&#8217;s visionary, CEO and Chairman of the Board&#8221;); Zhongpin , 2014 WL 6735457, at&#160;*9 (denying a motion to dismiss where it was reasonably conceivable that the defendant was a controller, in part because &#8220;[t]he Company relied so heavily on him to manage its business and operations that his departure from [the Company] would have had a material adverse impact on the Company&#8221;), rev&#8217;d on other grounds sub nom. , Cornerstone , 115 A.3d 1173; Cysive , 836 A.2d at 551&#8211;53 (finding post-trial that a minority stockholder had controller status where the stockholder was the chairman and CEO &#8220;and a hands-on one, to boot[,]&#8221; was &#8220;by admission, involved in all aspects of the company&#8217;s business, was the company&#8217;s creator&#8221; and &#8220;inspirational force&#8221;).

In 2021, without first consulting with the Board, 605 Musk appointed himself &#8220;Technoking&#8221;&#8212;a position he compared to being a monarch. 606 Ehrenpreis described that decision as &#8220;Elon being Elon[,]&#8221; 607 which suggests that the behavior is not unusual for Musk. Musk testified that the title was intended as a joke, 608 but that is a problem in itself. Organizational structures, including titles, promote accountability by clarifying responsibilities. They are not a joke. &#8203; &#8226; Musk operates as if free of Board oversight, as shown by his treatment of the SEC Settlement. 609 Musk&#8217;s &#8220;self-regulat[ory] 610 process for compliance and the Board&#8217;s desultory enforcement paint a vivid picture of their inability or unwillingness to rein in Musk. 611 Even after the settlement, the Disclosure Committee did not review his tweets. 612 At trial, Denholm was not sure whether the Disclosure Committee was fulfilling its obligations under the SEC Settlement. 613 &#8203; &#8226; Musk has ignored specific Board directives, such as unilaterally pausing Tesla&#8217;s acceptance of Bitcoin after the Board approved it. 614 Other surprise announcements include Musk discussing the idea of Tesla repurchasing billions of dollars of stock during an earnings call and without Board knowledge. 615 &#8203; &#8226; Musk regularly uses Tesla resources to address projects at other companies he&#160;owns. For example, after Musk acquired Twitter, he asked approximately&#160;50&#160;Tesla engineers to &#8220;volunteer&#8221; to help him evaluate Twitter&#8217;s&#160;engineering team. 616 No one on the Board challenged this decision. 617 Murdoch testified that this was &#8220;being monitored by the [Audit Committee] and being paid for.&#8221; 618 But Murdoch was not able to even &#8220;ballpark&#8221; the number of Tesla engineers involved, even though the monitoring he described had taken place at most &#8220;a few weeks&#8221; prior to his testimony. 619 Murdoch&#8217;s testimony also showed that any monitoring by the Audit Committee, such as it was, took place after the fact. 620 Similarly, in 2020, Musk directed Tesla management to send Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;smartest micro grid designer [] with a bunch of Powerpacks to [SpaceX][.]&#8221; 621 &#8203; &#8203; 605 Id. at 1085:1&#8211;7 (Kimbal) (&#8220;Question: Have you heard the word &#8216;Technoking&#8217; before?

Based on this list alone, it could be said that Musk wields unusually expansive managerial authority, equaling or even exceeding the imperial CEOs of the 1960s. 622 One set of scholars have created a term for this sort of person&#8212;a &#8220;Superstar CEO,&#8221; defined as an &#8220;individual[] who directors, investors, and markets believe make a unique&#160;contribution to company value.&#8221; 623 As the authors explain, the reasons for believing&#160;that a CEO is uniquely valuable to the corporation might vary, and those beliefs could be wrongly held. 624 But the reasons and their accuracy are irrelevant. 625 &#8220;[W]hat matters is only that such a belief does exist.&#8221; 626 CEO superstardom is relevant to controller status because the belief in the CEO&#8217;s&#160; singular importance shifts the balance of power between management, the board,&#160;and the stockholders. When directors believe a CEO is uniquely critical to the corporation&#8217;s mission, even independent actors are likely to be unduly deferential. They&#160;believe that &#8220;letting the CEO go would be harmful to the company and that alienating&#160;the CEO might have a similar effect.&#8221; 627 They &#8220;doubt their own judgment and&#160;hesitate to&#160;question the decisions of their superstar CEO.&#8221; 628 They view CEO self-dealing as the&#160;trade-off for the CEO&#8217;s value. 629 In essence, Superstar CEO status creates a &#8220;distortion field&#8221; 630 that interferes with board oversight. As discussed later in this analysis, the distortion field can weaken mechanisms by which stockholders hold fiduciaries accountable, a risk that becomes more severe when the Superstar CEO owns a large block of shares. 631 &#8203; 622 See generally Myles L.

See Elson Amicus Br. at&#160;1&#160;(citing Waters supra note&#160;12). 631 Superstar CEOs at 1400&#8211;02. &#160; I-59 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Faith in a Superstar CEO changes the dynamics of corporate decision making. That is true for all corporate decisions, but the risk becomes more acute for issues where the Superstar CEO&#8217;s interests are directly concerned. Nowhere is that truer than the Superstar CEO&#8217;s compensation. In the face of a Superstar CEO, it is even more imperative than usual for a company to employ robust protections for minority stockholders, such as staunchly independent directors. In this case, Tesla&#8217;s fiduciaries were not staunchly independent&#8212;quite the opposite, as discussed next. 632 3. Relationships With The Board &#8203; A director lacks independence if he or she is &#8220;so beholden to an interested director that his or her discretion would be sterilized.&#8221; 633 Both past and future rewards are relevant to this analysis. 634 The inquiry is &#8220;highly fact specific&#8221; and there is &#8220;no magic formula to find control.&#8221; 635 Nine directors served on the Board at relevant times. Jurvetson can be excluded given his early departure. Of the remaining eight, Musk was one and his brother another. 636 That is one fourth of the relevant directors. The other six had varying degrees of ties to Musk. The analysis begins with the four Compensation Committee members (Ehrenpreis, Buss, Denholm, and Gracias) and then turns to Murdoch and Johnson Rice. Gracias had the most extensive business and personal dealings with Musk and Kimbal. Prior to approving the Grant, Gracias held interests worth over $1&#160;billion in Musk-controlled entities, which Gracias admitted provided him &#8220;dynastic or generational wealth.&#8221; 637 Gracias and Musk had a decades-long relationship, which included joint family&#160;vacations and attendance at family birthday parties. Gracias had a 20-year friendship with Kimbal and was an investor in Kimbal&#8217;s business ventures. Gracias also received millions in Valor investments from Musk and Kimbal, and was a director of SpaceX and SolarCity, the latter until its acquisition by Tesla. &#8203; 632 To be sure, the Superstar CEO designation lacks definitional precision. It is hard to distinguish between an executive who is valuable to a corporation and a Superstar who is singularly or uniquely valuable to a corporation. As the scholars have acknowledged, this definitional imprecision could lead to &#8220;vague standards&#8221; that &#8220;create uncertainty and encourage litigation[,]&#8221; thus diminishing the utility of the Superstar CEO label.

Law. 321, 346 (2022) (raising concerns with the theory, noting that a CEO&#8217;s value to a company standing alone does not make the CEO a controlling stockholder). For that reason, the concept should not be deployed far and wide. When deployed, doubtless there will be close cases. But not here. Musk is a dead ringer. See generally Superstar CEOs at 1354&#8211;56 (identifying Musk as the paradigmatic Superstar CEO). If nothing else, the Superstar CEO concept is valuable for its descriptive power, because it explains what took place in this case. 633 Highland Legacy Ltd. v. Singer , 2006 WL 741939, at *5 (Del. Ch. Mar. 17, 2006) (citing cases). 634 See generally Da Lin, Beyond Beholden , 44 J. Corp. L. 515, 550 (2019).

Kimbal is Musk&#8217;s brother and business partner, and he recused himself from discussion of or voting on the 2018 Grant due to this conflict. PTO &#182; 232; see JX-791 at 1. 637 Trial Tr. at 774:22&#8211;24 (Gracias). &#160; I-60 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Gracias&#8217;s business ties to Musk, standing alone, support a finding that Gracias lacked independence from Musk. 638 Similarly, Gracias&#8217;s personal relationship with Musk, standing alone, support a finding that Gracias lacked independence from Musk. 639 The combination of business and personal ties make it undeniable that Gracias lacked independence from Musk. Ehrenpreis also had extensive business and personal relationships with Musk. Prior to the Grant, Ehrenpreis held interests worth at least $75&#160;million in Musk-controlled companies other than Tesla and had invested in Kimbal&#8217;s business ventures. Ehrenpreis also had longstanding personal and professional relationships with Musk and Kimbal that Ehrenpreis admitted had a &#8220;significant influence&#8221; on his professional career. 640 Although Ehrenpreis&#8217;s relationship with Musk was not as thick as that enjoyed by Gracias, it was weighty. Given the critical role he played as chair of the Compensation Committee, it was too weighty. Even if one could debate whether these ties rendered Ehrenpreis beholden to Musk in general, his actions in connection with the Grant demonstrate that he was beholden for that purpose. &#8203; 638 See generally Sandys v.

Their most significant, potentially comprising&#160;factor is the compensation each received as a Tesla director. For Denholm, it&#160;was&#160;&#8220;life-changing.&#8221; 641 For Buss, it was a large portion of his wealth. 642 Ordinary,&#160;market-rate compensation does not compromise a director&#8217;s independence. 643 Outsized director compensation can. 644 But Plaintiff does not argue that Musk established Buss and Denholm&#8217;s compensation so as to render them beholden. 645 Instead, it is a factor that must be considered when evaluating how Denholm and Buss acted when negotiating the Grant. The remaining directors present clearer calls. Murdoch lacked independence due to&#160;personal connection with Musk. He was a long-time friend of Musk before he joined&#160;the&#160;Board and they repeatedly vacationed together with their respective families. 646 It was during one such trip that Musk, Kimbal, and Gracias recruited Murdoch to the Board. 647 Johnson Rice, by contrast, had no compromising personal or business ties to Musk. Plaintiff concedes as much. Summing it up, it is easy to conclude based on the nature of their relationships with Musk that Kimbal, Gracias, and Murdoch lacked independence from Musk. After Jurvetson&#8217;s departure, and along with Musk, that was half the Board. The rest of the Director Defendants fall along a spectrum ranging from Ehrenpreis&#8217;s extensive relationships with Musk to Johnson Rice&#8217;s lack thereof. &#8203; 641 Id. at 397:6&#8211;12 (Denholm). 642 See supra &#167;&#160;I.C.1.a.ii. 643 See generally In re Kraft Heinz Co.

SolarCity II , 2022 WL 1237185, at *37&#8211;38. And that was surely true at the time. But it was not a factual finding that carries forward for all time. Moreover, Denholm&#8217;s approach to enforcement of the SEC Settlement, including unawareness of one of its key requirements, suggests a new lackadaisical approach to her oversight obligations. See supra &#167;&#160;I.I.3. 646 Trial Tr. at 819:2&#8211;16, 820:20&#8211;821:2, 847:5&#8211;849:15 (Murdoch). 647 Id. at 780:23&#8211;781:2 (Gracias); id. at 821:3&#8211;822:21 (Murdoch); id. at 1080:13&#8211;21 (Kimbal). &#160; I-62 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; 4. The Process &#8203; When assessing independence, Delaware courts consider not only the directors&#8217; relationships with the party to whom they are allegedly beholden, but also how they acted with respect to that party. 648 Directors with strong ties to a controller may demonstrate their independence. 649 And directors without strong individual ties to a controller may fall victim to a &#8220;controlled mindset.&#8221; 650 A controlled mindset can be evidenced by the directors approaching negotiations seeming &#8220;less intent on negotiating with [the controller] and more interested in achieving the result that [the controller] wanted[.]&#8221; 651 When evaluating control allegations in the context of a challenge to a merger, Chief Justice (then-Vice Chancellor) Strine once observed: [T]he question of whether the large block holder has &#8220;control&#8221; may be relevant, and intertwined with, the question of whether the merger was approved by uncoerced, independent directors seeking solely to advance the interests of the corporation and its disinterested stockholders rather than by supine servants of an overweening master. 652 The references to &#8220;supine servants&#8221; and &#8220;an overweening master&#8221; is hyperbolic, and&#160;no doubt deliberately so to give emphasis to the difficulty of the standard. But it hits&#160;home here. There is no greater evidence of Musk&#8217;s status as a transaction-specific controller than the Board&#8217;s posture toward Musk during the process that led to the Grant.&#160;Put simply, neither the Compensation Committee nor the Board acted in the best&#160;interests of the Company when negotiating Musk&#8217;s compensation plan. In fact,&#160;there&#160;&#160;is&#160;barely any evidence of negotiations at all. Rather than negotiate against Musk with the mindset of a third party, the Compensation Committee worked alongside him, almost as an advisory body. Multiple aspects of the process reveal Musk&#8217;s control over it, including the timeline, the absence of negotiations over the magnitude of the Grant or its other terms, and the committee&#8217;s failure to conduct a benchmarking analysis. In the end, the key witnesses said it all by effectively admitting that they did not view the process as an arm&#8217;s length negotiation. a. Musk Controlled The Timing. &#8203; Defendants emphasize that nine&#160;months passed after the initial April&#160;9 call between Musk and Ehrenpreis until the Board approved the Grant. In reality, however, most of the work on the Grant occurred during small segments of that nine-month timeline and under significant time pressure imposed by Musk. Before the Board or Compensation Committee had any substantive discussion concerning the Grant, Musk&#8217;s team proposed a highly accelerated schedule that contemplated approval of the Grant within less than two&#160;months. 653 A later version of the timeline was even more rushed, proposing only one Compensation Committee meeting &#8203; 648 In re Viacom Inc. S&#8217;holders Litig. , 2020 WL 7711128, at *24 (noting that analysis of controller&#8217;s influence on special committee focuses on how the committee actually negotiated the deal rather than just how the committee was set up); In re S.

And Brown&#8217;s concerns were ignored. The process decelerated to a reasonable pace only because Musk made it so. On July&#160;6, a day before the first Compensation Committee meeting, Maron announced that the new goal was to issue a grant in August or September. 656 On July&#160;30, a day before another Compensation Committee meeting, Musk emailed Maron to put the process on hold. 657 Although Musk agreed by email to let Maron &#8220;keep cranking[,]&#8221; 658 the wheels ground to a halt for several&#160;months. By August&#160;12, Brown was telling his team there was &#8220;no need to spend any time&#8221; on a presentation relating to the 2018 Grant due to negotiations between Musk and the Board. 659 Similarly, on August&#160;27, Ahuja told members of his team &#8220;[i]t was decided to defer this action by a few&#160;months.&#8221; 660 And Ahuja&#8217;s statement on September&#160;17 that &#8220;[w]e are back on track to finalize a CEO comp package[]&#8221; turned out to be a false start. 661 There was no meaningful activity through the end of October. Defendants exaggerate how much work occurred in August and September. 662 Although the Compensation Committee did meet on August&#160;14, there is no indication that this meeting involved a substantive discussion of the Grant. 663 The committee also met on September&#160;8, but the minutes of that meeting describe the discussion of the Grant as featuring only a &#8220;brief update&#8221; and an agreement to &#8220;provide additional details to the broader Board group at the next Committee meeting.&#8221; 664 Musk restarted discussions on the Grant on the morning of November&#160;9, just before a scheduled Compensation Committee meeting, telling Maron that he would &#8220;like to take board action as soon as possible if they feel comfortable and then it would go to shareholders.&#8221; 665 This message was not relayed during the November&#160;9 meeting. 666 But Maron conveyed the urgency three days later, emailing the full Board and members of the Working Group with a request for &#8220;another meeting on the issue of CEO compensation at everyone&#8217;s first available opportunity.&#8221; 667 Musk tried to pause the process again on November&#160;14 with another email to Maron, stating: &#8220;Given recent developments, let&#8217;s pause for a week or two. This would be terrible timing[.]&#8221; 668 The Board held a special meeting to discuss the Grant on November&#160;16, during which Ehrenpreis and Maron proposed approving the plan in &#8203; 654 JX-456 at 2 (6/26/17 email from Phillips to Ehrenpreis and Maron re: &#8220;Tesla | Executive Compensation Timeline&#8221;).

Although Musk&#8217;s November&#160;14 attempt to pause work on the 2018 Grant did not stop a Board meeting in the following days, it had enough of an effect that those working on the Grant did not consider the process &#8220;back on&#8221; until well until December, which is when another period of urgency commenced. 670 To sum it up, Musk unilaterally set the timeline or made last-minute proposals to the Board prior to six out of the ten Board or Compensation Committee meetings during which the Grant was discussed. 671 Musk dictated when the game clock started and stopped, thereby artificially compressing the work into short bursts that took place when he wished to move forward. Musk&#8217;s habit of shaking things up just before meetings also made it tough for the committee and its advisors to be prepared. Musk&#8217;s persistent pattern cannot be chalked up to coincidence. Musk controlled the timing. b. There Was No Negotiation Over The Size Of The Grant. &#8203; The most striking omission from the process is the absence of any evidence of adversarial negotiations between the Board and Musk concerning the size of the Grant. Musk made an initial proposal, and that proposal was the only one seriously considered until Musk unilaterally changed it six&#160;months later. Defendants did their best to paint a different picture, but the contemporaneous evidence betrayed them. They cannot meaningfully deny that Musk made the initial proposal. Although Ehrenpreis initiated the April&#160;9 discussion, 672 Musk proposed the&#160;terms during that call. 673 Musk told Ehrenpreis that he wanted a grant with 15&#160;tranches awarding 1% of Tesla&#8217;s total outstanding shares for each market capitalization increase of $50&#160;billion. 674 This proposal set the size and structure for the Grant until November&#160;9. 675 &#8203; 669 JX-669 at 2. 670 JX-717 at 1 (12/10/17 email noting the &#8220;importance and the timing on getting&#8221; an analysis of the stock-based compensation effects of the Grant &#8220;out quickly&#8221; because of a valuation deadline the next day); JX-717 at 1 (12/ &#8203; 11/17 email marked as &#8220;high&#8221; importance stating, &#8220;[w]e are back on with a vengeance (apologies in advance). . . .

The substance of the Compensation Committee&#8217;s September&#160;8 and December&#160;8 meetings seemed to escape Musk&#8217;s meddling, but neither were particularly substantial. See JX-697 at 3.

He proposed what he believed was a &#8220;reduced&#8221; compensation plan, which would award him a fully diluted 10% increment in his Tesla ownership if he reached a $550&#160;billion market capitalization. 676 After Musk learned that this proposal would result in greater compensation than his initial proposal, he changed it again. On December&#160;1, he stated: &#8220;That is more than intended. Let&#8217;s go with 10% of the current [fully diluted share] number[.]&#8221; 677 Defendants tout the reduced proposal of December&#160;1 as a &#8220;negotiated price,&#8221; 678 but Musk was more honest. Unprompted, he described his &#8220;proposal on December&#160;1&#8221; as &#8220;me negotiating against myself.&#8221; 679 To blunt the blow of Musk&#8217;s candor, Defendants vigorously argue secondary points. For example, they contend that the Compensation Committee considered a variety of award sizes prior to Musk&#8217;s new proposal on November&#160;9. 680 They cite to the August&#160;1 Compensia presentation, which identifies alternative market capitalization increments and corresponding award sizes of 7.5% and 10%. 681 But the presentation valued the 15% award only, and there is no record of any actual discussions concerning the alternative award sizes. 682 The minutes for the November&#160;16, 2017 Board meeting suggest that there was no actual discussion concerning alternatives. 683 And when Maron received Musk&#8217;s new offer, he compared it to Musk&#8217;s original proposal and not any alternatives. 684 By July&#160;2017, Musk&#8217;s 15-tranche was locked-in as the operating assumption. The Compensation Committee did not consider alternatives. As another example, Defendants emphasize that the Grant ultimately included 12 tranches, each awarding 1% of total outstanding shares and requiring $50&#160;billion in market capitalization growth. 685 According to Defendants, this represented &#8220;an appreciation in market capitalization that was $100&#160;billion more than what Musk had proposed in exchange for the same&#160;percentage of options.&#8221; 686 Although Defendants are correct that, all else equal, requiring more market capitalization growth for the same number of shares means a better deal for stockholders, there is simply no credible evidence that the shift from ten tranches to 12 was the result of any actual negotiation with Musk. To the contrary, the record reflects that the Board preferred the simplicity of total outstanding shares. 687 Toward this &#8203; 676 JX-664 at 1. 677 JX-682 at 1. 678 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 64-65; see also Trial Tr. at 584:9&#8211;19 (Musk). 679 Trial Tr. at 696:7&#8211;697:7 (Musk). 680 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 60&#8211;61 (citing JX-566 at 14&#8211;16); id. at 33 (citing JX-566 at 14&#8211;16); Trial Tr. at 213:14&#8211;23 (Ehrenpreis). 681 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 60&#8211;61 (citing JX-566 at 14&#8211;16); id. at 33 (citing JX-566 at 14&#8211;16). 682 JX-566 at 13&#8211;16, 23&#8211;24; see JX-633 at 17&#8211;21 (9/19/17 slide deck assuming 15% of total outstanding shares and providing 7.5% and 10% chart for comparison).

Tr. at 407:17&#8211;25 (stating he believed the Board used TOS, instead of FDS, because &#8220;it was a simpler approach&#8221;). &#160; I-66 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; end, they backed into 12 tranches when translating Musk&#8217;s demand of 10% of fully diluted shares into a round&#160;percentage of total outstanding shares while maintaining the $50&#160;billion/1% per tranche approach that Musk proposed in April. 688 The testimony from Ehrenpreis that Defendants cite does not support a finding that negotiations over the 12%/12-tranches occurred. 689 Ehrenpreis simply confirmed that he generally recalled &#8220;negotiations in the late part of 2017 about the terms of the&#8221; Grant. 690 When asked &#8220;[w]hat, if anything happened to the total amount of market capitalization that would accrue to the shareholders if Mr.&#160;Musk hit all of the targets in the plan as between the time of the negotiation and then the final plan,&#8221; Ehrenpreis responded &#8220;[d]uring that period of time, the market cap milestones increased by $100&#160;billion.&#8221; 691 Although this describes what happened, it does not establish the existence of a negotiation. In a follow-up question, Ehrenpreis avoided saying that he or anyone else negotiated with Musk about the market capitalization increase, again merely describing the changes that took place. 692 Maron also stopped short of describing this aspect of the process as a negotiation. He testified that although the final terms included the &#8220;size of the overall plan . . . were all different than I think were initially thought of by Elon. . . . I don&#8217;t want to say that&#160;&#160;it&#160;&#160;was&#160;necessarily over his objection. They weren&#8217;t things he thought of. They were things that the Board thought of and that he ultimately agreed to.&#8221; 693 Aspects of this testimony ring true&#8212;Musk&#8217;s various proposals lacked the detail necessary to implement them. In short, the Compensation Committee and the Board failed to negotiate the overall size or difficulty of the Grant with Musk. c. There Was No Meaningful Negotiation Over The Other Terms Of The Grant. &#8203; The other key terms of the Grant were: the Clawback Provision, the Leadership Requirement, the Five-Year Hold Period, and the M&amp;A Adjustment. As to these terms, the only back-and-forth in the record concerned the M&amp;A Adjustment, but Musk himself conceded that this was at most a minor feature of his compensation plan that he did not care about. He stated, at the end of negotiations on this point, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we will be making big acquisitions[]&#8221; and &#8220;[t]here is no chance I will game the economics here, so I&#8217;m fine with limits that prevent that.&#8221; 694 He then proceeded to propose a stricter M&amp;A Adjustment than was on the table. 695 Defendants argue that the Five-Year Hold Period was a negotiated point and a major concession. 696 But neither the documentary record nor the witness testimony corroborates Musk&#8217;s recollection of vigorous negotiation. The closest testimony on point is to the&#160;contrary, where Maron stated &#8220;[w]hen you talk about holding periods and the M&amp;A&#160;adjustments and the size of the overall plan, these were all different than I think were initially thought of by Elon. But I don&#8217;t want to say that it was necessarily over his objection. They weren&#8217;t things that he thought of.&#8221; 697 Meanwhile, one of the biggest purported concerns expressed by the Board was their desire to keep Musk engaged in Tesla despite his significant time commitments at his other companies, which included SpaceX, The &#8203; 688 JX-743 at 4&#8211;5; see JX-701 at 1 (12/10/17 email from Chang providing contemporaneous notes of the 12/10/17 special Compensation Committee meeting) (&#8220;We seem to be at the right place as far as size: 10% of FDS (~12% of TOS)&#8221;). 689 See Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 65 (citing Trial Tr. at 225:21&#8211;227:18 (Ehrenpreis)). 690 Trial Tr. at 225:21&#8211;24 (Ehrenpreis). 691 Id . at 225:21&#8211;226:7 (Ehrenpreis). 692 See id. at 226:17&#8211;227:18 (Ehrenpreis). 693 Maron Dep.

The most obvious way would have been a requirement that Musk devote substantially all of his professional time and attention to Tesla-related matters. Another option could have been a restriction on the amount of time and attention he could devote to companies other than Tesla. 699 Still other possibilities might include a forfeiture or clawback provision if Musk failed to provide the requisite level of time and attention. 700 Yet no one proposed anything like that to Musk. Delaware law recognizes that &#8220;asking the controlling stockholder to consider alternative options can change the negotiating dynamic.&#8221; 701 Whether Musk should commit a level of time to Tesla was a planned topic of discussion for a September&#160;8 call with Denholm, Ehrenpreis, and Musk. 702 During the September&#160;8 call, however, none of the participants raised the issue. 703 According to Musk, the issue &#8220;was not raised in this compensation structure&#8221; because the idea was &#8220;silly.&#8221; 704 Maron testified that the Board did not ask for such a requirement because &#8220;[t]hat would have been like saying goodbye to Elon[.]&#8221; 705 Defendants claim Musk would have rejected such restrictions, but the court will &#8220;never know because the . . .

There Was No Benchmarking Analysis. &#8203; The Grant process lacked a traditional benchmarking analysis, which compares&#160;a&#160;proposed compensation plan to plans at comparable firms. 707 Benchmarking &#8220;provides the compensation committee with a frame of reference with respect to what other companies are doing with respect to compensation[.]&#8221; 708 Benchmarking is the foundation of a compensation advisor&#8217;s analysis. 709 The witnesses agreed that benchmarking is typical and critical. Defendants&#8217; expert, Professor Kevin Murphy, previously opined that &#8220;the market for similarly situated executives provides a critical benchmark&#8221; the &#8220;board must consider in deciding whether to pursue&#8221; an executive and &#8220;how much to offer.&#8221; 710 Plaintiff&#8217;s expert, Professor Brian D. Dunn, opined that benchmarking is a &#8220;critical aspect and requirement of an effective&#160;compensation plan process.&#8221; 711 Brown confirmed that Compensia typically&#160;provides benchmarking consisting of an identified peer group and comparable positions at peer companies. 712 Burg too recognized that providing such information is necessary for the Compensation Committee&#8217;s advisors to &#8220;fulfill their responsibilities.&#8221; 713 Nevertheless, no traditional benchmarking study was conducted in connection with the Grant. 714 Defendants proffered reasons for not performing a traditional benchmarking study, but each rang hollow. For starters, Defendants argued that the Board considered &#8220;a lot of data that all fit within the overall bucket of benchmarking&#8221; throughout the process. 715 The primary evidence is the Compensia presentation from the July&#160;7, 2017 meeting, which included information about other CEOs. 716 For example, one of the slides lists the largest CEO pay packages in 2016. But no one contends that this market data constituted a benchmarking analysis. And none of the slides involved direct comparisons to the Grant. 717 &#8203; 707 Trial Tr. at 1461:10&#8211;1462:6 (Brown) (&#8220;Q.

Brown testified that he had a &#8220;really good idea&#8221; of what would happen if Compensia performed a traditional benchmarking study, and that &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t going to be useful information for the committee&#8221; because the Grant was so divorced from the market for comparable executives. 721 In a similar vein, Defendants argue that benchmarking was not needed because the 2018 Plan was &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; in that &#8220;no other CEO had been willing to condition his compensation on such audacious milestones,&#8221; especially at a time when a company was struggling. 722 They contend: &#8220;Traditional benchmarking is inapt if the companies, executives, and plans are not comparable.&#8221; 723 That is a hard sell. As CEO, Musk&#8217;s job was the same as every other public company CEO: improve earnings and create value. A benchmarking study would have shown the&#160;committee what other companies paid for executives to perform that same task.&#160;Moreover, the extraordinary nature of the Grant should have made benchmarking more critical, not less. Benchmarking would have informed the decision makers of the magnitude of difference between the Grant and market comparables. 724 e. The Key Negotiators Said It All. &#8203; In the end, the defense witnesses said it all. Ehrenpreis and Gracias took the lead on the Grant for the Compensation Committee (recall that attendance at Working Group meetings was &#8220;optional&#8221; for Denholm and Buss). 725 Maron was one of the primary go-betweens. 726 When asked to describe the process, none viewed the process as an arm&#8217;s length negotiation. Each viewed it is as a form of collaboration with Musk. Ehrenpreis testified that &#8220;during the entire process, there were check-ins with Elon. We were not on different sides of things. We were trying to make sure if we were going to go through this exercise that he was on board.&#8221; 727 &#8203; 718 Trial Tr. at 1462:5&#8211;1463:7 (Brown). 719 Id. at 1477:19&#8211;1478:6 (Brown). 720 Id. at 983:3&#8211;985:1, 990:3&#8211;992:7 (Dunn); id. at 1477:14&#8211;1478:12 (Brown) (confirming Compensia could have&#8212; &#8203; but did not&#8212;benchmark); PDX-2 at 5&#8211;6. 721 Trial Tr. at 1462:5&#8211;1463:1 (Brown); see also id. at 786:12&#8211;21, 787:5&#8211;10 (Gracias); id. at 347:3&#8211;10, 350:7&#8211;11, 351:2&#8211;7, 362:10&#8211;13 (Denholm); Denholm Dep.

These plans are about incenting behavior. Behavior is a feeling. It comes from inside the mind. And so we focus on what&#8217;s fair and what feels fair to people and what&#8217;s fair to the shareholders, what&#8217;s fair to us as investors, what&#8217;s fair to the executives. That&#8217;s how we think about it. We never engage in these positional negotiations , I want 10, you want 3, let&#8217;s yell about it. That&#8217;s not how we do things, not how anyone does things. 728 That is, in lieu of objective market data and arm&#8217;s length negotiation, the Compensation Committee opted for subjective feelings&#8212;&#8220;what feels fair.&#8221; The committee did not take &#8220;positional negotiations&#8221; against Musk. 729 Maron described the process similarly: &#8220;It was a cooperative, collaborative process. It wasn&#8217;t acrimonious. So when I say there wasn&#8217;t a conflict of interest, I think I&#8217;m thinking in my own mind was there an actual active conflict between the two parties; and I don&#8217;t think that there was. I think it was a cooperative collaborative process.&#8221; 730 To deal with a conflict, one must first recognize a conflict. &#8220;Conflict blindness and its lesser cousin, conflict denial, have long afflicted the financially sophisticated.&#8221; 731 Maron could not perceive the conflict, much less help deal with it. The testimony from the key witnesses is perhaps as close to an admission of a controlled mindset as a stockholder-plaintiff will ever get. 732 The Compensation Committee and Musk were not on different sides. They did not acknowledge the existence of a conflict. It was a cooperative and collaborative process. 733 &#8203; 728 Trial Tr. at 808:16&#8211;809:14 (Gracias) (emphasis added). 729 Id. ; see also Gracias Dep Tr. at 244:25&#8211;245:20 (&#8220;I did not have a positional negotiation with [Musk] about, hey, we want to give you one [tranche], and you want two and let&#8217;s go negotiate back and forth. . . .

A. That is not how I think about it, no.&#160;Q.&#160;Can you explain to me how you think about it? A. I think about compensation packages generally as what is fair to the executive and what is fair to the company. I don&#8217;t think about it as trying to get the very smallest thing possible ever.

Peru , 52 A.3d at 798 (&#8220;[F]rom inception, the Special Committee fell victim to a controlled mindset and allowed [the controller] to dictate the terms and structure of the [transaction].&#8221;). 733 Defendants concede that &#8220;[t]he Directors worked with Musk &#8216;in a collaborative, cooperative way to get to the end point.&#8217;&#8221; Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 66 (quoting Trial Tr. at 243:15&#8211;244:3 (Maron)). They justify that soft approach by reasoning that &#8220;the board has to have an ongoing relationship with the CEO,&#8221; and &#8220;it would be atypical for compensation negotiations between a board and a CEO to be adversarial.&#8221; Id. In essence, they argue that, because the Grant was for a sitting CEO, the Board was justified in conducting a process short of &#8220;an effective proxy for arms-length bargaining, such that a fair outcome equivalent to a market-tested deal resulted.&#8221; Loral , 2008 WL 4293781, at *22&#160;(citations omitted). The court recognizes that negotiations over CEO compensation give rise to strange dynamics because the parties need to work collaboratively after the negotiations have ceased, but that is true in many negotiations and in virtually every salary negotiation. There is a huge gap between being respectful and civil versus cooperating with the CEO to give him exactly what he wants. Even assuming that some level of cooperation and collaboration is called for, what took place here went beyond it. And this was also not the place for it. When considering the largest compensation plan in the history of the public markets, the directors needed to do more than accommodate the CEO. &#160; I-71 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; B. Defendants Bore The Burden Of Proving That The Grant Was Entirely Fair. &#8203; Because Musk exercised transaction-specific control over the Grant, entire fairness is the standard of review, and Defendants presumptively bear the burden of proof. 734 In Kahn v. Lynch Communication Systems, Inc. , 735 the Delaware Supreme Court &#8220;held that when the entire fairness standard applies, the defendants may shift the burden of persuasion by one of two means: first, they may show that the transaction was approved by a well-functioning committee of independent directors; or second, they may show that the transaction was approved by an informed vote of a majority of the minority shareholders.&#8221; 736 There was no well-functioning committee of independent directors here for the reasons discussed above. Thus, Defendants&#8217; only hope for burden shifting is to show that the stockholder vote was fully informed. For this purpose, Defendants bear the burden of proving that the vote was fully informed. 737 To show that the stockholder vote was fully informed, Defendants must establish that &#8220;stockholders were apprised of &#8216;all material information&#8217; related to that transaction.&#8221; 738 An omitted fact is material only where &#8220;there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.&#8221; 739 In other words, to be material, an omitted fact must have &#8220;significantly altered the &#8216;total mix&#8217; of information made available.&#8221; 740 Further, &#8220;once defendants travel[] down the road of partial disclosure of the history leading up to the [transaction] and use[d] the vague language described, they ha[ve] an obligation to provide the stockholders with an accurate, full, and fair characterization of those historic events.&#8221; 741 In assessing materiality, courts must balance &#8220;the benefits of additional disclosures against the risk that insignificant information may dilute potentially valuable information.&#8221; 742 Plaintiff advanced many arguments for why the stockholder vote was not fully informed. 743 Two are clear winners. The record establishes that the Proxy failed to disclose the Compensation Committee members&#8217; potential conflicts and omitted material information concerning the process. Defendants sought to prove otherwise, and they generally contend that the stockholder vote was fully informed because the most important facts about the Grant&#8212; &#8203; the economic terms&#8212;were disclosed. 744 But Defendants failed to carry their burden. &#8203; 734 Ams.

The Conflict Disclosures &#8203; A director&#8217;s conflict with a transactional counterparty is material information that should be disclosed. 745 In fact, a director&#8217;s potential conflict with a transactional counterparty is material information that should be disclosed. 746 The Proxy failed to disclose any of the Compensation Committee members&#8217; actual or potential conflicts with respect to Musk. 747 In fact, the Proxy repeatedly described the members of the Compensation Committee as independent, stating: &#8220;The[] [Grant] discussions first took place among the members of the Compensation Committee . . . all of whom are independent directors ;&#8221; 748 and &#8220;[t]he independent members of the Board , led by the members of the Compensation Committee, spent more than six&#160;months designing [the Grant].&#8221; 749 The Proxy&#8217;s introductory letter is &#8220;[f]rom the Independent Members of Tesla&#8217;s Board of Directors ,&#8221; and the first four signatories are Compensation Committee members Gracias, Ehrenpreis, Denholm, and Buss. 750 Notably, Gracias signed as &#8220;Lead Independent Director.&#8221; 751 The description of the Compensation Committee members as &#8220;independent&#8221; was decidedly untrue as to Gracias and proved untrue as to the remaining committee members. At a minimum, Musk&#8217;s relationships with Ehrenpreis and Gracias gave rise to potential conflicts that should have been disclosed. 752 Ultimately, all of the directors acted under a controlled mindset, calling into question the disclosure as to each of them. Defendants sought to prove that they disclosed the information at issue, both in the Proxy and elsewhere. 753 The Proxy disclosed the Tesla director compensation policy, which is one potential source of conflict. 754 Defendants also showed that they disclosed some potential sources of conflict in other public filings, such as Buss&#8217;s tenure at SolarCity and Ehrenpreis&#8217;s and Gracias&#8217;s investments in SpaceX. 755 But those disclosures make no mention of important factors affecting independence, including Gracias&#8217;s and Ehrenpreis&#8217;s personal and other business &#8203; 745 See, e.g. , In re Orchard Enters., Inc.

But the Proxy could have discussed the relevant relationships while stating that the Board did not view them as serious impediments to independence, thereby allowing&#160;stockholders to make their own assessment. This is precisely what Tesla did in the other disclosure document that Defendants pointed to when seeking to prove that the total mix of information included information about Musk&#8217;s financial connections with Gracias and Ehrenpreis. 759 &#8220;What defendants were not free to do was to take the position that the stockholders had no right to know this information because they, the defendants, had determined it was not important.&#8221; 760 Overall, Defendants failed to prove that the information about conflicts was adequately disclosed. The Proxy was materially deficient on this point. 2.&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;The Process Disclosures When asked to approve a transaction, stockholders are entitled to a full and accurate description of the material steps in the board or committee process that resulted in the transaction. 761 The components and effectiveness of a board or committee&#8217;s process, including the parties&#8217; bargaining positions, are of &#8220;obvious importance&#8221; to stockholders. 762 Consequently, &#8220;a fiduciary&#8217;s duty is best discharged through a broad rather than&#160;a&#160;restrictive approach to disclosure.&#8221; 763 A board or committee may not create&#160;a&#160;false&#160;narrative as to the process for how a transaction was completed; partial&#160;disclosures that sterilize the actual events are insufficient. 764 Although a disclosure document need not give a &#8220;play-by-play[,]&#8221; 765 &#8220;when fiduciaries choose to provide the history of a transaction, they have an &#8203; 756 See JX-878 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement); JX-379. 757 Zalmanoff v.

The Proxy does not disclose the level of control that Musk exercised over the process&#8212;e.g., his control over the timing, the fact that he made the initial offer, the fact that his initial offer set the terms until he changed them six&#160;months later, the lack of negotiations, and the failure to benchmark, among other things. The parties focus on one specific omission. The Proxy does not disclose the April&#160;9 conversation between Musk and Ehrenpreis during which Musk established the key terms of the 2018 Grant. A discussion of this conversation appeared in at least four earlier drafts of the Proxy. 770 The final Proxy instead opens its discussion of the development of the 2018 Grant with the following passage: With the 2012 Performance Award nearing completion, the Board&#160;engaged in more than six months of active and ongoing discussions regarding a new compensation program for Mr.&#160;Musk, ultimately concluding in its decision to grant the CEO Performance Award. These discussions first took place among the members of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the &#8220;Compensation Committee&#8221;), all of whom are independent directors, and then with the Board&#8217;s other independent directors, including its two newest independent directors, Linda Johnson Rice and James Murdoch. 771 Plaintiff contends that, in addition to describing the Compensation Committee members and Murdoch as &#8220;independent,&#8221; the statement is inaccurate because the &#8220;discussion[] first took place&#8221; between Ehrenpreis and Musk, not among the members of the Compensation Committee. 772 Defendants claim that Plaintiff is misreading the sentence, which they say means only that discussions among the Compensation Committee were &#8220;first&#8221; as compared to subsequent discussions with the full Board, not the &#8220;first&#8221; discussions in the process as a whole. 773 Even accepting Defendants&#8217; borderline reading, the April&#160;9 conversation between&#160;Ehrenpreis and Musk was material and should have been disclosed. 774 Musk&#8217;s&#160;April&#160;9 proposal to Ehrenpreis set the terms of discussion for &#8203; 766 Id.

Implicitly, Defendants argue that stockholders only need to know the economics of a transaction to cast an informed vote. Defendants&#8217; position finds no support in Delaware law. No case has held that a corporation needs to disclose only the economic terms of a transaction when securing&#160;a&#160;stockholder vote. In fact, then-Vice Chancellor Strine rejected as &#8220;frivolous&#8221;&#160;the&#160;argument that &#8220;the only material facts necessary to be disclosed&#8221; regarding a stock incentive plan are the &#8220;exact&#8221; economic terms of the plan. 776 This holding recognizes that materiality extends beyond economics to information regarding process, conflicts, incentives, and more. 777 Defendants&#8217; authorities do not support the new rule that they advance. 778 &#8203; 775 See JX-445 at 3&#8211;4; JX-464 at 5&#8211;7; JX-479; JX-490 at 5&#8722;7; JX-640 at 3; JX-631 at 2; see also JX-664 (Musk asking to &#8220;move forward&#8221; with the 2018 Grant &#8220;in a reduced manner from before&#8221;); Trial Tr. at 676:18&#8211;677:1 (Musk) (&#8220;Q.

Bosnjak , where the court held that the &#8220;absence of benchmarking information&#8221; was not a material omission &#8220;because the proxy statements disclosed all material terms of the precise equity awards that the stockholders were being asked to approve.&#8221; 2014 WL 2930869, at *9 (Del. Ch. June&#160;26, 2014). But no one claims here that the absence of disclosed benchmarking information rendered the stockholder vote uninformed. Defendants further cite In re 3COM Corp. for the proposition that Delaware courts do not require the disclosure of a projected options&#8217; value, and thus Tesla went above and beyond by disclosing the approximately $55.8&#160;billion maximum theoretical value of the Grant. 1999 WL 1009210, at *6&#8722;8 (Del. Ch. Oct. 25, 1999); JX-878 at 24&#8722;25 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). But the fact that Tesla disclosed some information does not excuse the Company&#8217;s other disclosure deficiencies. &#160; I-76 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Moreover, &#8220;once defendants travel[] down the road of partial disclosure of the history leading up to the [transaction] . . . , they ha[ve] an obligation to provide the&#160;stockholders with an accurate, full, and fair characterization of those historic events.&#8221;&#160; 779 Here, Defendants chose to disclose aspects of the process. Having done so, they had an obligation to provide accurate, full, and fair information about that process, which they failed to do. At a minimum, a corporation cannot disclose false information, such as describing key negotiators as independent. That is what happened here. C. Defendants Failed To Prove That The Grant Was Entirely Fair. &#8203; Because Defendants failed to show that the stockholder vote was fully informed, they bore the burden of proving entire fairness. &#8220;The requirement of fairness is unflinching in its demand that where one stands on both sides of a transaction, he has the burden of establishing its entire fairness, sufficient to pass the test of careful scrutiny by the courts.&#8221; 780 The Delaware Supreme Court provided guidance on the entire fairness review in SolarCity III . 781 Quoting Weinberger v. UOP, Inc. , the high court described the entire fairness review as follows: The concept of fairness has two basic aspects: fair dealing and fair price. The former embraces questions of when the transaction was timed, how it was initiated, structured, negotiated, disclosed to the directors, and how the approvals of the directors and the stockholders were obtained. The latter aspect of fairness relates to the economic and financial considerations of the proposed merger, including all relevant factors: assets, market value, earnings, future prospects, and any other elements that affect the intrinsic or inherent value of a company&#8217;s stock. However, the test for fairness is not a bifurcated one as between fair dealing and price. All aspects of the issue must be examined as a whole since the question is one of entire fairness. 782 Entire fairness review calls upon the court to &#8220;carefully analyze the factual circumstances, apply a disciplined balancing test to its findings, and articulate the bases upon which it decides the ultimate question of entire fairness.&#8221; 783 &#8220;Given the unitary nature of the test, findings in one area may seep into the findings of the other. As a result, &#8216;a fair process usually results in a fair price.&#8217; The opposite is also true: &#8216;an unfair process can infect the price.&#8217;&#8221; 784 Here, Defendants failed to prove that the Grant was the product of fair dealing or at a fair price. a.&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;Fair Dealing &#8220;The element of &#8216;fair dealing&#8217; focuses upon the conduct of the corporate fiduciaries&#160;in&#160;effectuating the transaction.&#8221; 785 When discussing fair process in SolarCity&#160;III , the Delaware&#160;Supreme Court encouraged this court to focus on what it refers to as&#160;the&#160;&#8220; Weinberger factors.&#8221; 786 Those factors are &#8220;how the deal was initiated and timed, how it was structured and negotiated, and how it was approved[.]&#8221; 787 Those factors &#8220;form the core of a court&#8217;s fair dealing analysis.&#8221; 788 This decision already addressed most of the facts pertinent to the fair dealing inquiry when discussing how Musk controlled the process and the disclosure deficiencies.

Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the process leading to the Grant was fair. i.&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;Initiation And Timing The first Weinberger factor &#8220;examines how the decision under challenge was initiated.&#8221; 789 &#8220;The scope of this factor is not limited to the controller&#8217;s formal act of making the proposal; it encompasses actions taken by the controller in the period leading up to the formal proposal.&#8221; 790 The goal of the analysis is to determine whether the controller timed the proposal opportunistically to take advantage of the minority stockholders. 791 In SolarCity II , for example, the court asked whether Musk timed the transaction to &#8220;exploit any inherent coercion[.]&#8221; 792 As to this factor, Defendants have a handful of facts in their favor. The timing of the first discussion was dictated by Ehrenpreis, not Musk. Ehrenpreis credibly testified that he initiated this discussion because Tesla had reached nearly all of the milestones of Musk&#8217;s prior compensation plan. There is no evidence that Musk was secretly behind the start of negotiations, or that a starting negotiation in April&#160;2017 gave Musk any significant advantage at the expense of the minority stockholders. Nor is there any evidence that Musk set the table for the negotiations by acting in a manipulative or duplicitous manner. To show manipulative conduct, Plaintiff points to Musk&#8217;s May&#160;2018 public statement that he would not remain CEO forever. Plaintiff argues that this statement was intended to pressure the Board. That is not a far-fetched theory, but it is not supported by the record. The more likely explanation is that Musk was considering stepping down from CEO to become Chief Products Officer. Another likely explanation is that Musk lacks a filter, so his public statement easily could have been a momentary thought that immediately found expression. In all events, he clarified his intentions at the time and at trial: Musk is committed, Tesla forever. Although Musk did not manipulate the initial timing of the process, he repeatedly and unilaterally manipulated the timeline of the process. To summarize the facts discussed above, before the Board or Compensation Committee had a substantive discussion concerning the Grant, Musk&#8217;s team proposed a highly accelerated schedule that contemplated approval of the Grant within less than two&#160;months. The committee&#8217;s independent advisors asked for more time and were told no. It was Musk who unilaterally extended the July deadline to August or September. Musk then unilaterally put the process on hold again at the end of July, causing work to slow and then stop entirely. Musk restarted discussions on the morning of November&#160;9. Musk asked to pause the process again on November&#160;14 and was ultimately successful in delaying work until December. Musk instigated another period of urgency on December&#160;11, placing the Grant &#8220;on a fast track,&#8221; 793 and resetting the target date for Board approval to January. The Board eventually approved the 2018 Grant on January&#160;21. &#8203; 789 Frederick Hsu , 2020 WL 2111476, at *36. 790 Dole , 2015 WL 5052214, at *26. 791 In re BGC P&#8217;rs, Inc. Deriv.

It [is] what occurred, or more properly did not occur,&#8221; that matters. 794 Put differently, one must look to how the time constraints affected the process. Here, Musk&#8217;s &#8220;red light, green light&#8221; approach negatively affected the process in&#160;two&#160;ways. First, although the process spanned nine&#160;months, most of the work occurred during small bursts and under Musk-imposed time pressure. Second, Musk made determinations at the last minute, compressing the timeline, adjusting the timeline, or proposing new terms prior to six out of the ten Board or Compensation Committee meetings during which the Grant was discussed. Musk&#8217;s habit of shaking up the timeline or changing his proposal just before a meeting made it tough for the directors and their advisors to meaningfully evaluate the Grant and respond. The time constraints and last-minute adjustments impaired the process. ii.&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;&#8199;Negotiations The next Weinberger factor examines how the transaction was negotiated and structured. This factor proves pivotal, because arm&#8217;s-length negotiations can make up for other flaws. 795 But the opposite is also true. The lack of arm&#8217;s-length negotiations can overshadow positive aspects of a process. 796 Perhaps for this reason, Defendants rely heavily on the negotiations to demonstrate&#160;fair process. They emphasize the number of Board, Compensation Committee, and Working Group meetings. They tally&#160;months spent (both the total and those involving &#8220;active deliberation&#8221;) and even estimate total hours worked. 797 Defendants also tout their advisors&#8217; qualifications and integrity. 798 Although Defendants cast the negotiations as the strongest aspect of the process, they are actually the most dramatic failure. Defendants elevate form over substance, proffering what Plaintiff&#8217;s counsel aptly described as &#8220;a &#8203; 794 457 A.2d at 711. 795 See, e.g., SolarCity III , 298 A.3d at 710 (agreeing with the trial court that although the process had flaws, the process included several &#8220;redeeming features that emulated arms-length bargaining&#8221; &#8203;(citing SolarCity II , 2022 WL 1237185, at *36)); BGC P&#8217;rs , 2022 WL 3581641, at *42 (finding that although &#8220;[t]here were certainly flaws,&#8221; &#8220;[t]he record demonstrates that the Special Committee undertook good faith, arm&#8217;s length negotiations&#160;. . . that resulted in a deal with a favorable structure and a fair price&#8221;); S.&#160;Muoio &amp; Co.

As this decision has found, the Compensation Committee was compromised by conflicts. They could not negotiate at arm&#8217;s length against Musk. Not surprisingly, there is no evidence of any adversarial negotiation with Musk&#160;concerning the size of the Grant. Rather, Musk made an initial proposal, and that&#160;proposal was the only one seriously considered until Musk unilaterally changed it six&#160;months later. Defendants are correct that, in the final stretch of the process, the Grant went from a 10%/10-tranche FDS structure to a 12%/12-tranche TOS structure. Defendants are correct that, all else equal, requiring more growth in market capitalization for the same number of shares means a better deal for stockholders. But there is no credible evidence that the shift from ten tranches to 12 and the associated increase in the difficulty of the market capitalization targets resulted from any actual negotiation with Musk. To the contrary, as discussed above, the Board backed into 12 tranches when translating Musk&#8217;s demand of 10% of fully diluted shares into a round&#160;percentage of total outstanding shares while maintaining the $50&#160;billion/1% per tranche approach that Musk proposed back in April. As to the other terms, the purported concessions secured by the Compensation Committee did not result from negotiations either. The Clawback Provision was the&#160;bare&#160;minimum necessary to comport with existing Tesla policy and did not address&#160;other&#160;key Board goals, such as the Board&#8217;s desire to retain Musk. The Leadership&#160;Requirement was less restrictive than in the prior Grant and not tailored to&#160;fit&#160;the retention goal either. The Five-Year Hold Period resulted from Ehrenpreis&#8217;s directive to find &#8220;creative options&#8221; for reducing the grant date fair value. It does not protect stockholders because Musk is not restricted from selling or pledging his nearly 21.9%&#160;stake. 801 The industry-standard M&amp;A Adjustment&#8212;which merely prohibited Musk&#160;from gaming the Grant&#8217;s milestones through inorganic growth&#8212;were a non-issue for Musk. 802 And his acknowledgement that Tesla would not &#8220;be making any big acquisitions&#8221; rendered that provision functionally irrelevant. 803 The Compensation Committee&#8217;s independent advisors cannot help the analysis because they played no role in any negotiations and were not tasked with challenging the committee&#8217;s thinking or presenting alternatives to the Grant. 804 Defendants agree that benchmarking is standard and essential. They knew benchmarking would expose the Grant as many multiples larger than any conceivable comparison. But the Compensation Committee did not ask its advisors to provide a benchmarking analysis, which would have given them some perspective on how (in Musk&#8217;s words) &#8220;really crazy&#8221; the Grant was. 805 &#8203; 799 Pl.&#8217;s Post-Trial Answering Br. at 39. 800 Valeant Pharms.

Musk&#8217;s current compensation plan, and that plans were underway to design the next compensation program for Mr.&#160;E. Musk. The Board acknowledged Mr.&#160;E. Musk&#8217;s extraordinary achievement of the stretch milestones it had set for him and for having increased the market capitalization of the Company by more than 10x over the last five&#160;years.&#8221;); JX-439 (6/23/17 Compensation Committee meeting minutes) (&#8220;Mr.&#160;Ehrenpreis then led a Committee discussion evaluating the importance of retaining and properly incentivizing Mr.&#160;Musk. The Committee discussed how Mr.&#160;Musk had been and would likely remain a key driver of the Company&#8217;s success and its prospects for growth, and that, accordingly, it would be in Tesla&#8217;s interest, and in the interest of its stockholders, to structure a compensation package that would keep Mr.&#160;Musk as the Company&#8217;s fully-engaged CEO. The Committee also discussed the fact that unlike most other Chief Executive Officers, Mr.&#160;Musk manages multiple successful large companies. The Committee discussed the importance of keeping Mr.&#160;Musk focused and deeply involved in the Company&#8217;s business, and the corresponding need to formulate a compensation package that would best ensure that Mr.&#160;Musk focuses his innovation, strategy and leadership on the Company and its mission.&#8221;); JX-509 (7/7/17 Compensation Committee meeting minutes) (&#8220;The Committee determined that one important theme for any compensation plan was to ensure that it created adequate structural incentives to focus on the long term growth and success of the Company and the creation of shareholder value as opposed to simply short-term increases in stock price, while at the same time properly balancing risks and rewards for the Company, its shareholders and Mr.&#160;Musk. With these principles in view, the Committee again deliberated the pros and cons of various structures, and various Committee members continued to express their views that the 2012 Compensation Plan had worked extremely well for the Company, its stockholders and in incentivizing Mr.&#160;Musk to spend the bulk of his time on the Company and create enormous value for the Company. In light of these factors, Committee members expressed their views that there could be significant benefits from creating a similarly structured program for Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s next compensation plan, including providing strong shareholder alignment, while also recognizing the changed nature and size of the Company since the 2012 Plan was implemented. The Committee further recognized Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s unique drive for major accomplishments and the desire and need to motivate him with significant goals and milestones. The Committee recognized and expressed its desire to properly balance the motivation of stretch goals for Mr.&#160;Musk against any de-motivating factors created by seemingly impractical, unrealistic or unachievable goals. The Committee then discussed with Compensia and Radford the valuation and accounting considerations for a potential equity grant. Questions were asked and full discussion ensued.&#8221;); JX-571 (8/1/17 Compensation Committee meeting minutes) (&#8220;The Committee discussed the overall size of the new program and how it should reflect Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s qualities and motivations. They also discussed the need for stretch goals and a long term outlook heavily focused on the creation of significant shareholder value. The Committee discussed an overall framework of a plan that could last 10-15&#160;years, while also noting the pace at which Mr.&#160;Musk achieved the ambitious goals set forth in the 2012 Compensation Program (including leading the Company during a period in which the market cap of the company grew over 10x in five&#160;years). As part of this discussion, the Committee considered whether it was appropriate to consider new and/or alternative metrics for milestones in light of the Company&#8217;s increased size and focus, or whether the ultimate focus should be on the growth of the Company and the creation of significant shareholder value. The Committee further discussed the setting of major milestones and the importance of balancing the creation .of aggressive incentives for Mr.&#160;Musk while not disincentivizing him with seemingly impracticable or achievable goals. The Committee also discussed the appropriateness of large stretch goals and a structure in which Mr.&#160;Musk would receive zero compensation unless he achieved an incredibly significant milestone and created significant shareholder value, and how this type of structure had served shareholders and the Company so effectively in the 2012 Compensation Program. The Committee acknowledged that if Mr.&#160;Musk agreed to accept the significant risk in such a structure, the reward would have to be likewise significant, but yet fair to the Company and optimal for the shareholders given the milestones that would be achieved and the value created. The Committee discussed the milestones and various metrics that could be used to measure performance. The members of the Committee expressed a preference for simplicity and their desire to fully align the performance metrics to, ultimately, the creation of shareholder value.&#8221;); &#160; I-84 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; cited and accepted goals of equity-based compensation plans. Here, however, the words seem like empty phrases. One obvious reason to question these statements is that the Board said that it wished to retain Musk as the &#8220;fully engaged CEO ,&#8221; yet the Leadership Requirement allowed Musk to step down to the role of &#8220;Chief Product Officer.&#8221; There is a more fundamental issue. Professor Charles Elson submitted an amicus brief in this action persuasively arguing that &#8220;[e]quity compensation for corporate executives was designed to solve a specific problem at a specific time in American corporate history.&#8221; 832 To summarize that lesson in broad strokes, the first half of the 1900s witnessed a transition from &#8220;era of the &#8216;robber barons&#8217;&#8221; to the era of the Berle-Means corporation, where corporations were run by &#8220;professional managers with little skin in the game.&#8221; 833 The theory behind equity-linked compensation plans was that &#8220;[b]road-based equity ownership throughout the organization by management, directors, and employees&#8221; is &#8220;the most effective motivation for continuous vigilance throughout the organization.&#8221; 834 For that reason and due to changes in federal tax law, by the 1980s, &#8220;pressure built on companies to&#160;.&#160;. . strengthen the link between pay and performance.&#8221; 835 Corporations began &#8220;using much more equity-based compensation.&#8221; 836 &#8203; JX-631 (9/19/17 Board meeting minutes) (&#8220;Various topics were discussed, including the success of the previous 2012 CEO Compensation Program and how motivating it as for Mr.&#160;Musk; Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s ambitions for the Company and its potential to be one of the most valuable companies in the world; Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s passion and dedication to the Company and its mission; the directors&#8217; views of Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s incentives; and Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s other commitments and potential competing interests. The directors expressed their desire to significantly align Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s compensation with shareholder interests; to focus on long term creation of value; and to balance risk and reward for all stakeholders. A full discussion ensued. During this discussion, the Board recognized, among other things, the challenges of the CEO role and Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s value to the Company, its products and businesses, and its culture of innovation. In particular, the Board recognized Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s ability to execute in the face of significant challenges. The Board further discussed Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s motivations and how the CEO Compensation Program might best serve the Company and its shareholders, while properly incentivizing Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s ambitions for the Company.&#8221;); JX-729 (12/12/17 special Board meeting minutes) (stating that the &#8220;program was characterized by the . . . full alignment of CEO gains with the creation of shareholder value&#8221; and that &#8220;[t]he Board acknowledged this alignment as one of their primary focuses and discussed their understanding that this full shareholder alignment was Mr.&#160;Musk&#8217;s desire as well&#8221;); JX-791 (1/ &#8203; 21/18 Board meeting minutes) (stating that &#8220;the Board concluded that the proposed CEO Performance Award created very close alignment with shareholder interests that had the potential to powerfully incentivize Mr.&#160;Musk, and created the greatest likelihood to propel the Company through its next stages of growth&#8221;). 832 Elson Amicus Br. at 4. 833 Id. at 4 (citing Amy Deen Westbrook &amp; David A.

There are many examples of visionaries with large pre-existing&#160;equity&#160;holdings&#160;foregoing compensation entirely: Zuckerberg, Bezos, Gates, and others so familiar to the world that no first names are required. 839 In each instance, the CEO&#8217;s board recognized that the executive&#8217;s preexisting ownership stake provided sufficient incentive to grow the companies that they had built. 840 So why not here? Why did Tesla have to &#8220;give&#8221; anything in these circumstances? Musk&#160;owned 21.9% of Tesla at the time of the Grant. 841 If the goals were retention,&#160;engagement, and alignment, then Musk&#8217;s pre-existing equity stake provided a powerful incentive for Musk to stay and grow Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization. After all, he stood to benefit by over $10&#160;billion for every $50&#160;billion increase. His equity stake was also a powerful incentive to avoid allowing Tesla to fall in what Musk might consider to be incapable hands. 842 Moreover, Musk was not going &#8203; 837 See generally id. at 7&#8211;8; but see Coffee, What Caused Enron?

Or, at a minimum, could the Board have accomplished its goals with less, and would Musk have taken it?

The Grant was, by Compensia&#8217;s reckoning, the &#8220;larg[est] compensation opportunity to [a] CEO that [they] have seen.&#8221; 846 Even other &#8220;highly leveraged plan designs with very aggressive performance requirements&#8221; did not compare to the Grant. 847 The Grant was more than 30x greater than its nearest comparable plan, and that was Musk&#8217;s 2012 Grant. 848 ISS noted that the Grant was 250x greater than the median peer 2017 CEO compensation. 849 The incredible size of the biggest compensation plan ever&#8212;an unfathomable sum&#8212;seems to have been calibrated to help Musk achieve what he believed would make &#8220;a good future for humanity.&#8221; 850 A good future for humanity is a really good thing. Some might question whether colonizing Mars is the logical next step. But, in all events, that &#8220;get&#8221; had no relation to Tesla&#8217;s goals with the compensation plan. Considering this glaring defect in Defendants&#8217; give/get argument, it does not support a finding of fair price. ii. The Unique Circumstances And CEO &#8203; Defendants next argue that the Grant was suited for &#8220;this time&#8221; and &#8220;this CEO.&#8221; 851 To support that argument, they advance the following factual narrative. Tesla was setting an ambitious course&#8212;to become &#8220;one of the most valuable companies in the world&#8221; 852 and &#8220;accomplish[] Tesla&#8217;s mission of accelerating the world&#8217;s transition to sustainable energy.&#8221; 853 Tesla&#8217;s ambitious goals forced it to the point of an existential crisis in 2017, and Musk was critical to Tesla&#8217;s future. 854 Musk was on the verge of walking away and was distracted by his other ventures. &#8203; 843 See e.g., JX-390 at 20&#8211;21. 844 Dkt. 227 (&#8220;Defs.&#8217; Pre-Trial Br.&#8221;) at 43 (emphasis added). 845 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 70 (emphasis added). 846 JX-440 at 106. 847 Id. at 14. 848 PDX-2 at 5. 849 JX-916. 850 JX-664 at 1. It is questionable as to whether the Grant would even make a dent in that goal, given that Musk testified that his space odyssey would cost trillions. Musk Dep. Tr. at 115:24&#8211;117 (Musk discussing his goals and stating that SpaceX&#8217;s goals would require the help of &#8220;other companies and governments&#8221;). 851 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 78. 852 JX-878 at 3 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). 853 Id. 854 Trial Tr. at 1251:4&#8211;23 (Murphy). &#160; I-87 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Musk required an &#8220;added incentive&#8221; to stay &#8220;at the helm,&#8221; and he is uniquely motivated by highly ambitious goals. 855 As Gracias explained, the Board looked to fashion milestones that would give Musk the &#8220;dopamine hits&#8221; he needed. 856 There is no doubt that &#8220;this time&#8221; was precarious at Tesla, that the Board viewed &#8220;this&#160;CEO&#8221; as critical to Tesla&#8217;s success, that Musk is a unique person who has been&#160;singularly instrumental to Tesla, and that Musk is genuinely motivated by&#160;highly&#160;ambitious goals. But there are reasons to question other aspects of Defendants&#8217; factual narrative. For example, if transformative growth is the goal, then why set milestones&#160;at the time of the Grant that were 70% likely to be achieved? Even assuming that the 70% figure was a conservative accounting metric, it casts some doubt on the &#8220;stretch&#8221; nature of the early milestones. Further, how can one conclude that Musk was on the verge of walking away from a leadership role at Tesla when Musk made it clear that he &#8220;would not quit Tesla,&#8221; is &#8220;heavily invested in Tesla, both financially and emotionally, and views Tesla as part of his family[?]&#8221; 857 Defendants also argue that Musk needed additional incentives to stay on at Tesla or he would spend more time at SpaceX, where he could fulfill his galactic ambitions to establish interplanetary travel, colonize Mars, and potentially earn more money in the meantime. 858 That argument begs another question: if encouraging Musk to prioritize Tesla over his other ventures was so important, why not place guardrails on how much time or energy Musk had to put into Tesla? Even assuming the truth of all of Defendants&#8217; points, they do not add up. There is simply no evidence that the &#8220;added incentive&#8221; provided by a Grant of this magnitude was necessary, much less fair. This unique circumstance and this unique CEO do not support a finding of fair price. iii. The &#8220;Only Upside&#8221; Argument &#8203; Defendants &#8220;only upside&#8221; argument relies on the Grant&#8217;s structure, which they say ensured that Musk drove meaningful and sustained growth in four ways. First , Defendants argue that pairing market capitalization milestones with operational milestones provided &#8220;safety in the structure.&#8221; 859 The market capitalization milestones operated as the &#8220;primary goals,&#8221; while the operational goals functioned as &#8220;support for those [market capitalization] goals.&#8221; 860 Brown testified: &#8220;There&#8217;s a high level of performance required to earn one of these. So then, if it was possible to drive that kind of growth on a solid operational basis and earn more than one of them in a year, that seemed like a win for . . . shareholders.&#8221; 861 But of the two operational metrics, the revenue milestones were not dependent on profitability. As Compensia acknowledged, this aspect of the Grant &#8220;ignores profitability.&#8221; 862 ISS noted that &#8220;up to eight tranches (three-quarters of the award, or nearly $2&#160;billion in value) may vest based on market capitalization and revenue goals, even if earnings do not clear the EBITDA performance hurdles.&#8221; 863 Thus, Musk could still receive billions under the Grant without Tesla experiencing the fundamental growth that the Grant was intended to incentivize. 864 &#8203; 855 Id. at 1251:17&#8211;22 (Murphy); id. at 730:21&#8211;731:7 (Gracias). 856 Id. at 728:23&#8211;729:13 (Gracias). 857 JX-831 at 13&#8211;14; see also Trial Tr. at 644:11&#8211;15 (Musk) (affirming that as of early 2018, he was heavily invested in Tesla both financially and emotionally and viewed Tesla as part of his family); id. at 76:7&#8211;15 (Ehrenpreis) (confirming Musk affirmed his love for Tesla during the first discussion regarding a new grant); id. at 785:1&#8211;7 (Gracias) (testifying that Musk views Tesla as one of the most important things in his life). 858 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 15&#8211;16; Murphy Opening Rep., at 50&#8211;51; Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Suppl.

Third , Defendants argue that the M&amp;A Adjustment&#8212;which applied to both the market capitalization and operational milestones&#8212;prevented Musk from &#8220;gam[ing]&#8221; any of the milestones. 868 Maron explained that the adjustments &#8220;ensure that if Elon was going to benefit from this plan, that it was because he had led the Company to organic value&#160;creation,&#160;not just buying another big company and having that add significantly to&#160;&#160;the&#160;market capitalization of Tesla.&#8221; 869 The adjustments would be triggered not only by stock deals, but also by cash deals, a term that Compensia &#8220;hadn&#8217;t put in . . . other plans before.&#8221; 870 But an M&amp;A adjustment is standard in executive compensation, 871 and Musk acknowledged that Tesla would not &#8220;be making any big acquisitions,&#8221; limiting the utility of this provision. 872 Fourth , Defendants argue that the Five-Year Hold Period served stockholder interests. 873 Defendants state that &#8220;[w]hile every other stockholder could have cashed in during the nearly 400 trading days that Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization was over $650&#160;billion, 874 Musk was unable to sell a single share of the compensation he earned under the 2018 [Grant].&#8221; 875 This is true. 876 But it ignores that there was no limit to Musk&#8217;s ability to sell any of the millions of Tesla shares he already owned. Certainly, the structural provisions on which Defendants rely have value. But that value is limited as to each provision. Given the other defects in the Grant, these provisions do not individually or in the aggregate lead to a finding of fair price. iv. The Ambitious Milestones &#8203; Defendants argue that the Grant price was fair because its milestones were ambitious and difficult to achieve. The defense witnesses all testified in harmony that the milestones were &#8220;audacious&#8221; and &#8220;extraordinarily ambitious.&#8221; 877 Defendants concede that three operational milestones aligned with internal projections but note that the Company routinely missed projections. 878 &#8203; 865 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 75 (citing Trial Tr. at 1274:23&#8211;1276:9 (Murphy)). 866 Trial Tr. at 264:16&#8211;21 (Maron). 867 JX-878 at 15 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). 868 JX-784 at 1&#8211;2 (1/17/18 emails between Maron and Musk). 869 Trial Tr. at 265:8&#8211;13 (Maron). 870 Id. at 1465:11&#8211;19 (Brown). 871 Id. at 1010:20&#8211;24 (Dunn). 872 JX-784 at 2. 873 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 76&#8211;77. 874 Id. at 77 (citing JX-1510 at 1). 875 Id. 876 Trial Tr. at 255:6&#8211;13 (Maron) (discussing holding periods and the &#8220;lock&#8221; on Musk); id. at 63:20&#8211;64:1 (Ehrenpreis) (stating the Board &#8220;negotiated an agreement that [Musk] would hold for five&#160;years after both the achievement and vesting and exercise of the options&#8221;). 877 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Br. at 85. 878 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Answering Br. at 67&#8211;68. &#160; I-89 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; It is hard to square Defendants&#8217; coordinated trial testimony concerning Tesla&#8217;s internal&#160;projections with the contemporaneous evidence. 879 The Board deemed some of the milestones 70% likely to be achieved soon after the Grant was approved. 880 This assessment&#160;was made under a conservative accounting metric, but there are other indications&#160;that Tesla viewed its projections as reliable. They were developed in the ordinary&#160;course, approved by Musk and the Board, regularly updated, shared with&#160;investment banks and ratings agencies, and used by the Board to run Tesla. 881 Several&#160;Tesla executives affirmed their quality, accuracy, and reliability. 882 Plus, Tesla hit the first three milestones, consistent with its projections, by September&#160;30, 2020. 883 Defendants bore the burden of proving fair price. Given the conflicting testimony concerning the projections, Defendants failed to prove the factual predicate for their argument that all the milestones were &#8220;ambitious&#8221; and difficult to achieve. This argument does not support a finding of fair price. v. The Private-Equity Analogy &#8203; Defendants argue that the Grant price is fair by comparing the Grant to compensation structures common in the portfolio companies backed by venture capital and private equity funds, where CEOs often receive a&#160;percentage of the equity. That argument has one obvious problem: Tesla is not a privately held portfolio company. Defendants offer no theoretical justification for comparing the Grant to venture capital or private equity compensation structures when Tesla is not a venture capital or private equity backed entity. This was something Defendants came up with for trial. During the negotiations, neither Defendants nor their experts benchmarked the Grant to venture capital compensation. They never considered an analogy to a venture capital or private equity investment. That is because Tesla was a publicly traded corporation with a market capitalization of $53&#160;billion, tens of thousands of stockholders, and a CEO who already owned 21.9% of Tesla&#8217;s equity. Examined on its own terms, Defendants&#8217; private-equity analogy relies on valuing&#160;the&#160;Grant as a&#160;percentage of Tesla&#8217;s fully diluted shares. Defendants peg&#160;that&#160;percentage at 6.4%, but there is no evidence that Musk, the Board, the Compensation Committee, or its advisors ever considered this figure during the process. Defendants take the 6.4% figure from the Proxy, which based the figure on &#8220;illustrat[ive]&#8221; dilution assumptions. 884 Focusing on the 6.4% figure alone, Defendants&#8217; financial expert testified that &#8220;something like 6 to 10&#160;percent [equity] for a new CEO would be totally normal&#8221; in VC- and private-equity-backed companies. 885 Gracias testified that an equity stake of around 6% for a CEO would be considered &#8220;on the low end.&#8221; 886 Defendants describe the Grant &#8203; 879 See, e.g. , BCIM Strategic Value Master Fund, LP v. HFF Inc., 2022 WL 304840, at *2&#160;(Del. Ch. Feb. 2, 2022) (&#8220;The witness testimony often conflicted with the contemporaneous record. In resolving factual disputes, this decision generally has given greater weight to the contemporaneous documents.&#8221;). 880 JX-1028 at 15 (4/27/18 Audit Committee Agenda); JX-1023 at 6 (4/27/18 Significant Accounting Matters for 2018 Q1 Audit Committee). 881 See e.g., id. at 353:6&#8211;355:15 (Ahuja) (projections were &#8220;accurate and truthful&#8221;); id. at 466:14&#8211;469:24 (Ahuja) (noting the projections were shared with outside rating agencies). 882 See e.g., id. at 391:16&#8211;23 (Maron) (&#8220;Tesla would do its . . . earnest best to . . . provide quality information&#8221; to the rating agencies). 883 PTO &#182;&#182; 265&#8211;71. 884 JX-878 at 24 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). It represents one of many possible scenarios for what Musk could receive on a fully diluted basis if the Grant fully vests and all five of the assumptions listed in the Proxy hold. For example, for Musk to achieve a mere 6% under the Grant, &#8220;the 527,491 shares of common stock subject to the tenth and final tranche of the 2012 [Grant]&#8221; would need to &#8220;become fully vested, outstanding and held by Musk.&#8221; Id. But the tenth tranche of the 2012 Grant never vested. PTO &#182;&#182; 209&#8211;10. 885 Trial Tr. at 1112:2&#8211;24 (Gompers). 886 Id. at 735:11&#8211;736:2 (Gracias). &#160; I-90 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; as riskier than VC compensation, because it was &#8220;100&#160;percent risk-free&#8221; for Tesla and its stockholders, 887 but Musk would get &#8220;nothing if we hadn&#8217;t doubled the market cap.&#8221; 888 Referring to his portfolio companies, Gracias put it bluntly: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a CEO who would sign up for that.&#8221; 889 Gracias&#8217;s testimony, however, was simply not credible. Based on Tesla&#8217;s April&#160;25, 2022 market capitalization of just over $900&#160;billion, 890 6% of Tesla would be worth $54&#160;billion, just under the maximum value disclosed in the Proxy. 891 Any number of CEOs would sign up for that. And many VC startups offer CEOs the prospect of great riches or nothing at all. Even if the comparison holds, Musk already is earning more than the 20% a hedge fund would earn as a typical carried interest. So, while Musk is not receiving a base salary, he is already receiving more (incentive-wise) than a fund who would manage Tesla&#8217;s assets. And given that Musk does not need a base salary to keep his pretend hedge fund afloat, it would not be necessary. Regardless, there are other ways to value the Grant, such as its maximum value and its grant date fair value. The Board and stockholders were told that, if Musk achieved all 12&#160;tranches of the Grant, he would receive a maximum value of $55.8&#160;billion. 892 As disclosed&#160;to the Board and stockholders, the grant date fair value was $2,615,190,052. 893 &#160;By&#160;this measure, it was a massive award&#8212;an internal ISS email described it as &#8220;about 250&#160;times the peer median.&#8221; 894 Brown, Ehrenpreis, and Denholm all acknowledged that&#160;the&#160;award was exceptionally large, with Ehrenpreis agreeing it was &#8220;entirely without&#160;precedent.&#8221; 895 Plaintiff&#8217;s expert noted that the Grant was 33x larger than Musk&#8217;s&#160;2012 Grant&#8217;s $78M grant date fair value. 896 By the most conservative comparison that Plaintiff&#8217;s expert could conceivably devise, the Grant&#8217;s grant date fair value was 11.7x larger than the median peer group. 897 Indeed, the Grant entitled Musk to billions even if Tesla significantly underperformed its historical results. 898 Just as they did during the negotiation process, Defendants ignored these figures. Defendants&#8217; portfolio-company analogy misses the mark in multiple ways. It does not support a finding of fair price. &#8203; 887 Id. at 1395:19&#8211;1398:3 (Buss). 888 Id. at 736:24&#8211;737:11 (Gracias). 889 Id. at 736:24&#8211;737:4 (Gracias). 890 PTO &#182; 71. 891 JX-878 at 18 (2/8/18 Schedule&#160;14A Proxy Statement). 892 Id. at 24. 893 JX-792 at 7; JX-878 at 34. 894 JX-916. 895 Trial Tr. at 130:22&#8211;131:7 (Ehrenpreis); id. at 360:20&#8211;361:12 (Denholm); id. at 1480:9&#8211;14 (Brown). 896 Dunn Opening Expert Rep. at 103; Dkt. 291 (&#8220;Pl.&#8217;s Demonstrative 2&#8221;), at 9 (showing the magnitude of the comparison); Trial Tr. 994:7&#8211;13 (noting the comparison between the two grants). 897 Trial Tr. at 992:2&#8211;7 (Dunn); Pl.&#8217;s Demonstrative 2 at 6, 7.

The Stockholder Vote &#8203; Defendants argue that disinterested stockholder approval is &#8220;compelling evidence&#8221;&#160;that the price was fair. 899 The stockholder vote is one component of the fair&#160;price&#160;analysis, but whether the vote represents a form of market evidence that can support a certain price depends on the sufficiency of the disclosure. Generally, a stockholder&#160;vote is only &#8220;compelling evidence&#8221; of fairness absent a disclosure violation. 900 &#160;The Delaware Supreme Court in Weinberger held that an uninformed stockholder vote is totally &#8220;meaningless.&#8221; 901 Under Weinberger , therefore, the stockholder vote is a meaningless indicator as to fair price. In SolarCity III , the high court took a more nuanced approach, affording a stockholder vote some weight despite a deficient proxy statement where the key issue was SolarCity&#8217;s value. The high court noted that there was significant public information available concerning that issue, &#8220;SolarCity traded in an efficient market,&#8221; and a strong independent fiduciary positively affected the process. 902 Defendants did not establish those facts here. 903 Because the stockholder vote was not fully informed, it does not support a finding of fair price. vii. The Hindsight Defense &#8203; Defendants finally argue from hindsight. They claim the Grant was fair because it worked: &#8220;Tesla thrived because of the 2018 Plan.&#8221; 904 With this argument, Defendants ask the court to infer a direct causal relationship between the Grant and Tesla&#8217;s subsequent&#160;performance. But Defendants failed to prove that Musk&#8217;s less-than-full time&#160;efforts for Tesla were solely or directly responsible for Tesla&#8217;s recent growth, or that the Grant was solely or directly responsible for Musk&#8217;s efforts. This last argument is empty rhetoric, not evidence of fair price. D. Rescission Is A Reasonable And Appropriate Remedy. &#8203; As a remedy, Plaintiff only seeks recission. 905 Plaintiff&#8217;s lead argument is that the court must rescind the Grant due to the disclosure defects because the Board conditioned the Grant on stockholder approval. 906 Plaintiff also argues that the court has discretion to order rescission as a remedy for fiduciary breaches. 907 Plaintiff further argues that, &#8220;at minimum,&#8221; the court should rescind the options for the first three tranches given lack of disclosure regarding the probability of achievement. 908 Plaintiff&#8217;s first argument does not work. It would create an overly rigid rule that runs contrary to the Delaware Supreme Court&#8217;s holding in Weinberger . But Plaintiff&#8217;s second argument prevails, so the court need not reach Plaintiff&#8217;s third argument. The court orders rescission of the Grant as a remedy for Defendants&#8217; fiduciary breaches. &#8203; 899 Defs.&#8217; Post-Trial Opening Suppl. Br. at 21 (citing ACP Master, Ltd. v.

The Automatic-Invalidation Argument Fails. &#8203; In their lead argument, Plaintiff argues that because Tesla conditioned the Grant on stockholder approval, 909 &#8220;a single material disclosure failure invalidates&#8221; the Grant. 910 Plaintiff says that because stockholder approval was secured by a materially misleading Proxy, the Grant is void, and rescission must follow automatically. There is appeal in the simplicity of Plaintiff&#8217;s approach, but it is not quite right. The consequence of an uninformed stockholder vote depends in part on whether that vote was required or voluntary. 911 The DGCL requires stockholder approval of certain transactions&#8212;a merger, sale of assets, or charter amendment, for example. 912 For transactions that require stockholder approval, there are strong arguments that a material disclosure deficiency &#8220;warrant[s] an injunction against, or rescission of, the transaction.&#8221; 913 But even when a Delaware statute requires a vote, this court does not necessarily void&#160;the transaction when that vote was uninformed. 914 In Weinberger , the Delaware Supreme Court made that plain by correcting a misunderstanding that it believed had arisen regarding the importance of its ruling in Vickers . That earlier decision held that rescission was the preferred remedy for a transaction tainted by disclosure violations and that rescissory damages&#8212;the monetary equivalent of rescission&#8212;could substitute where rescission was not feasible. 915 The Weinberger decision stressed that rescissory damages were not the exclusive remedy for a disclosure violation. 916 By the same logic, rescission need not follow automatically either. That is especially true for transactions where the DGCL does not require a stockholder vote. A corporation may seek stockholder approval for those transactions, and the vote is &#8220;voluntary&#8221; in this sense. 917 When voluntarily seeking stockholder approval, the failure to disclose material information &#8220;will eliminate any effect that a favorable stockholder vote otherwise might have for the validity of the transaction or for the applicable standard of review.&#8221; 918 For example, the failure to disclose material information will render Corwin cleansing and burden shifting unavailable. 919 The failure to disclose material information might also support an independent claim and remedies for breach of the duty of disclosure, 920 but the court has discretion when fashioning a remedy in that context as well. The failure to disclose material information for voluntary stockholder votes, however, does not automatically invalidate the transaction. &#8203; 909 JX-791 at 4 (Board resolution approving the Grant) (stating that the Grant was effective &#8220;subject to the Requisite Stockholder Approval&#8221; and that if the Grant &#8220;fail[ed] to receive the affirmative vote&#8221; of a majority of non-Musk shares, it would be &#8220;forfeited and cancelled&#8221;). 910 Pl.&#8217;s Post-Trial Opening Br. at 1&#8211;11. 911 See generally In re Wayport, Inc.

Ch. 2023) (same). &#160; I-93 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The stockholder vote on the Grant was not required by the DGCL. 921 The Proxy deficiencies defeated Defendants&#8217; effort to shift the burden under the entire fairness standard to Plaintiff, but the uninformed vote does not automatically invalidate the Grant. Plaintiff responds that although a stockholder vote was not required by the DGCL, the Board elevated the vote to a requirement by conditioning the Grant on a favorable vote. That does not change the outcome, because the court has the discretion to determine a remedy for corporate transactions where a vote is required. The same is true for a transaction that is conditioned on a vote. 2. Rescission Is Warranted. &#8203; Although rescission does not automatically flow from the disclosure deficiencies, it is nevertheless an available and appropriate remedy. &#8203; 921 In this case, the stockholder vote was required by NASDAQ Rules. NASDAQ R. 5635(c) (&#8220;Shareholder approval is required prior to the issuance of securities when a stock option or purchase plan is to be established or materially amended or other equity compensation arrangement made or materially amended&#8221;). Plaintiff argues that the NASDAQ requirement renders the vote &#8220;legally required&#8221; and thus mandates recission for transactions approved by a materially deficient vote. Pl.&#8217;s Post-Trial Suppl. Answering Br. at 8. Effectively, Plaintiff urges this court to serve as NASDAQ enforcement agent, which would run contrary to multiple strains of Delaware law.

Ch. 2015) (holding that stockholder plaintiff had no standing to prosecute a violation of the NYSE Rules); In re Aquila Inc. S&#8217;holders Litig. 805 A.2d 184, 192 n.11 (Del.

Stock Options Litig ., 1989 WL 73245, at *3 (E.D. Pa. July&#160;5, 1989))). Given the complexities of this issue in an otherwise complex case, the court does not reach it. And the court need not do so because, ultimately, Plaintiff is getting what he asks for&#8212;recission. &#160; I-94 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; The remedy of rescission &#8220;restore[s] the parties substantially to the position which they occupied before making the contract.&#8221; 922 &#8220;Rescission &#8216;is not given for every serious&#160;mistake and it is neither given nor withheld automatically, but is awarded as&#160;&#160;a&#160;matter&#160;of judgment.&#8217;&#8221; 923 The court has broad discretion to award recission where&#160;the&#160;facts&#160;and circumstances warrant. 924 This court has awarded rescission as a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty, 925 particularly in the context of self-dealing transactions. 926 Indeed, as discussed above, the Delaware Supreme Court referred to recission as &#8220;the preferrable remedy&#8221; in Vickers for breach of fiduciary duty where one party has misled another. 927 To be entitled to equitable rescission, a plaintiff must demonstrate that rescission is both &#8220;reasonable and appropriate&#8221; under the circumstances. 928 This includes showing that it is possible for &#8220;all parties to the transaction [to] be restored to the status quo ante, i.e. , to the position they occupied before the challenged transaction.&#8221; 929 &#8203; 922 Craft v.

Lawal , 2017 WL 5289611, at *20 (Del. Ch. Nov. 7, 2017). 929 Strassburger v. Earley , 752 A.2d 557, 578 (Del. Ch. 2000) (emphasis in original). &#160; I-95 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; Plaintiff has demonstrated that rescission is reasonable, appropriate, and practicable. This Grant is not &#8220;too complex to unscramble[.]&#8221; 930 Rescission is uniquely available: no third-party interests are implicated, the entire Grant sits unexercised and undisturbed, and exercised shares would be subject to the Five-Year Hold Period. 931 Defendants argue that rescission is a harsh consequence that would leave Musk uncompensated. But Musk&#8217;s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts. And Defendants have not offered a viable alternative short of leaving the Grant intact. On this point, Valeant is instructive. 932 There, the plaintiff claimed that the directors of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International breached their fiduciary duties by awarding themselves and other executives and employees large cash bonuses in connection with a &#8220;later-aborted corporate restructuring.&#8221; 933 All but one defendant settled before trial, and the court found that the remaining defendant failed to prove that the transaction was fair. 934 Although that defendant went all-in on the defense that the entirety of his bonus was fair and presented no evidence for why a portion of the bonus was more defensible than the remaining amount, 935 he asked that the court limit disgorgement &#8220;to the extent that the bonus was unfair.&#8221; 936 The court rejected that argument given the defendant&#8217;s failure of proof and ordered disgorgement of the entire amount. 937 As in Valeant , Defendants heralded the Grant as fair but failed to meet their burden. They also failed to identify any logically defensible delta between the unfair Grant and a fair one. As a result, there is nothing in the record to allow the court to fashion a remedy that would order recission only to the extent the Grant was unfair. &#8220;Once a breach of duty is established, uncertainties in awarding damages are generally resolved against the wrongdoer.&#8221; 938 Here, the wrongdoers are Defendants, and so the court resolves uncertainty against them. III. CONCLUSION &#8203; For the foregoing reasons, judgment is entered in Plaintiff&#8217;s favor. The parties are to confer on a form of final order implementing this decision and submit a joint letter identifying all issues, including fees, 939 that need to be addressed to bring this matter to a conclusion at the trial level. &#8203; 930 In re Sunbelt Beverage Corp.

Ratification of defective corporate acts and stock. (a)&#160;&#160;&#160;Subject to subsection (f)&#160;of this section, no defective corporate act or putative stock shall be void or voidable solely as a result of a failure of authorization if ratified as provided in this section or validated by the Court of Chancery in a proceeding brought under &#167;&#160;205 of this title. (b)&#160;&#160;&#160;(1) In order to ratify 1 or more defective corporate acts pursuant to this section (other than the ratification of an election of the initial board of directors pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the board of directors of the corporation shall adopt resolutions stating: (A)&#160;&#160;&#160;The defective corporate act or acts to be ratified; (B)&#160;&#160;&#160;The date of each defective corporate act or acts; (C)&#160;&#160;&#160;If such defective corporate act or acts involved the issuance of shares of putative stock, the number and type of shares of putative stock issued and the date or dates upon which such putative shares were purported to have been issued; (D)&#160;&#160;&#160;The nature of the failure of authorization in respect of each defective corporate act to be ratified; and (E)&#160;&#160;&#160;That the board of directors approves the ratification of the defective corporate act or acts. Such resolutions may also provide that, at any time before the validation effective time in respect of any defective corporate act set forth therein, notwithstanding the approval of the ratification of such defective corporate act by stockholders, the board of directors may abandon the ratification of such defective corporate act without further action of the stockholders. The quorum and voting requirements applicable to the ratification by the board of directors of any defective corporate act shall be the quorum and voting requirements applicable to the type of defective corporate act proposed to be ratified at the time the board adopts the resolutions ratifying the defective corporate act; provided that if the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, any plan or agreement to which the corporation was a party or any provision of this title, in each case as in effect as of the time of the defective corporate act, would have required a larger number or portion of directors or of specified directors for a quorum to be present or to approve the defective corporate act, such larger number or portion of such directors or such specified directors shall be required for a quorum to be present or to adopt the resolutions to ratify the defective corporate act, as applicable, except that the presence or approval of any director elected, appointed or nominated by holders of any class or series of which no shares are then outstanding, or by any person that is no longer a stockholder, shall not be required. (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;In order to ratify a defective corporate act in respect of the election of the initial board of directors of the corporation pursuant to &#167;&#160;108 of this title, a majority of the persons who, at the time the resolutions required by this paragraph (b)(2) of this section are adopted, are exercising the powers of directors under claim and color of an election or appointment as such may adopt resolutions stating: (A)&#160;&#160;&#160;The name of the person or persons who first took action in the name of the corporation as the initial board of directors of the corporation; (B)&#160;&#160;&#160;The earlier of the date on which such persons first took such action or were purported to have been elected as the initial board of directors; and (C)&#160;&#160;&#160;That the ratification of the election of such person or persons as the initial board of directors is approved. (c)&#160;&#160;&#160;Each defective corporate act ratified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be submitted to stockholders for approval as provided in subsection (d)&#160;of this section, unless: &#160; J-1 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;(A) No other provision of this title, and no provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, or of any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party, would have required stockholder approval of such defective corporate act to be ratified, either at the time of such defective corporate act or at the time the board of directors adopts the resolutions ratifying such defective corporate act pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and (B)&#160;Such defective corporate act did not result from a failure to comply with &#167;&#160;203 of this title; or (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;As of the adoption of the resolutions of the board of directors adopted pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, there are no shares of valid stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, regardless of whether there then exist any shares of putative stock. (d)&#160;&#160;&#160;(1) If the ratification of a defective corporate act is required to be submitted to stockholders for approval pursuant to subsection (c)&#160;of this section, due notice of the time, place, if any, and purpose of the meeting shall be given at least 20&#160;days before the date of the meeting to each holder of valid stock and putative stock, whether voting or nonvoting, at the address of such holder as it appears or most recently appeared, as appropriate, on the records of the corporation. (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;The notice shall also be given to the holders of record of valid stock and putative stock, whether voting or nonvoting, as of the time of the defective corporate act (or, in the case of any defective corporate act that involved the establishment of a record date for notice of or voting at any meeting of stockholders, for action by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting, or for any other purpose, the record date for notice of or voting at such meeting, the record date for action by written consent, or the record date for such other action, as the case may be), other than holders whose identities or addresses cannot be determined from the records of the corporation. (3)&#160;&#160;&#160;The notice shall contain a copy of the resolutions adopted by the board of directors pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the information required by paragraphs (b)(1)(A) through (E)&#160;of this section and a statement that any claim that the defective corporate act or putative stock ratified hereunder is void or voidable due to the failure of authorization, or that the Court of Chancery should declare in its discretion that a ratification in accordance with this section not be effective or be effective only on certain conditions must be brought within 120&#160;days from the applicable validation effective time. (4)&#160;&#160;&#160;At such meeting, the quorum and voting requirements applicable to ratification of such defective corporate act shall be the quorum and voting requirements applicable to the type of defective corporate act proposed to be ratified at the time of the approval of the ratification, except that: a.&#160;&#160;&#160;If the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, any plan or agreement to which the corporation was a party or any provision of this title in effect as of the time of the defective corporate act would have required a larger number or portion of stock or of any class or series thereof or of specified stockholders for a quorum to be present or to approve the defective corporate act, the presence or approval of such larger number or portion of stock or of such class or series thereof or of such specified stockholders shall be required for a quorum to be present or to approve the ratification of the defective corporate act, as applicable, except that the presence or approval of shares of any class or series of which no shares are then outstanding, or of any person that is no longer a stockholder, shall not be required; b.&#160;&#160;&#160;The approval by stockholders of the ratification of the election of a director shall require the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of such director, except that if the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation then in effect or in effect at the time of the defective election require or required a larger number or portion of stock or of any class or series thereof or of specified stockholders to elect such director, the affirmative vote of such larger number or portion of stock or of any class or series thereof or of such specified stockholders shall be required to ratify the election of such director, except that the presence or approval of shares of any class or series of which no shares are then outstanding, or of any person that is no longer a stockholder, shall not be required; and c.&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event of a failure of authorization resulting from failure to comply with the provisions of &#167;&#160;203 of this title, the ratification of the defective corporate act shall require the vote set forth in &#167;&#160;203(a)(3) of this title, regardless of whether such vote would have otherwise been required. &#160; J-2 TABLE OF CONTENTS &#160; (5)&#160;&#160;&#160;Shares of putative stock as of the adoption by the board of directors of resolutions pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section (and without giving effect to any ratification that becomes effective after such adoption) shall neither be entitled to vote nor counted for quorum purposes in any vote to ratify any defective corporate act. (e)&#160;&#160;&#160;(1)&#160;&#160;&#160;If a defective corporate act ratified pursuant to this section would have required under any other section of this title the filing of a certificate in accordance with &#167;&#160;103 of this title, and either (i)&#160;such certificate requires any change to give effect to the defective corporate act in accordance with this section (including a change to the date and time of the effectiveness of such certificate) or (ii)&#160;a certificate was not previously filed under &#167;&#160;103 of this title in respect of the defective corporate act, then, in lieu of filing the certificate otherwise required by this title, the corporation shall file a certificate of validation with respect to such defective corporate act in accordance with &#167;&#160;103 of this title.

(i)&#160;&#160;&#160;Ratification under this section or validation under &#167;&#160;205 of this title shall not be deemed to be the exclusive means of ratifying or validating any act or transaction taken by or on behalf of the corporation, including any defective corporate act, or any issuance of stock, including any putative stock, or of adopting or endorsing any act or transaction taken by or in the name of the corporation prior to the commencement of its existence, and the absence or failure of ratification in accordance with either this section or validation under &#167;&#160;205 of this title shall not, of itself, affect the validity or effectiveness of any act or transaction or the issuance of any stock properly ratified under common law or otherwise, nor shall it create a presumption that any such act or transaction is or was a defective corporate act or that such stock is void or voidable. &#160; J-5 TABLE OF CONTENTS TESLA, INC. 1 TESLA ROAD AUSTIN, TX 78725 SCAN TO &#61559; VIEW MATERIALS &amp; VOTE VOTE BY INTERNET Before The Meeting - Go to www.proxyvote.com or scan the QR Barcode above Use the Internet to transmit your voting instructions and for electronic delivery of information up until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time the day before the meeting date.
