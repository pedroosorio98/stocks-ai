Some of our key governance practices include the following&#58; &#252; Proxy access &#252; Annual election of directors (no classified Board structure) &#252; Ability to call special meetings by two or more stockholders holding at least 10% of outstanding shares &#252; Majority voting for directors in uncontested election &#252; No supermajority voting requirements for bylaw amendments &#252; Separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) roles, with a Lead Independent Director &#252; No &#8220;poison pill&#8221; &#252; Strong independent Board &#8212; 7 of 9 directors are independent &#252; Annual&#160;say-on-pay&#160;vote &#252; Annual Board and committee evaluations &#252; Anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy for employees and directors &#252; Independent directors meet in executive session regularly &#252; Stock ownership guidelines for all executive officers and directors &#252; Active board refreshment process, adding 2 women directors and 2 ethnically diverse directors since 2018 &#252; Robust stockholder engagement program &#252; Active CEO and senior leadership succession review Our Fiscal Year 2021 Performance Financial Results Highlights Our Fiscal Year 2021 performance continued to be strong despite the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and disruption in normal business activities. Our financial results highlights* for Fiscal Year 2021 include increases in&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Year-over-year revenue to $27,450 million, 15% above our fiscal year ended November&#160;1, 2020 (&#8220;Fiscal Year 2020&#8221;). &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;GAAP operating income to $8,519 million, 112% above Fiscal Year 2020&#59; and non-GAAP operating income to $15,912 million, 23% above Fiscal Year 2020. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Net cash provided by operating activities to $13,764 million, 14% above Fiscal Year 2020&#59; and free cash flow to $13,321 million, 15% above Fiscal Year 2020. * See Appendix A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3 PROXY SUMMARY Return of Capital to Stockholders Our strong cash flow in Fiscal Year 2020 enabled us to return an aggregate of $7,511 million to our stockholders during Fiscal Year 2021, consisting of $6,212 million in cash dividends and $1,299 million in eliminations of shares withheld to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. In addition, our strong free cash flow in Fiscal Year 2021 enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $4.10 per share in our first quarter of our fiscal year ending October&#160;30, 2022 (&#8220;Fiscal Year 2022&#8221;), an increase of 14% over the quarterly dividend paid in Fiscal Year 2021. Dividend Increase YoY% 23% 11% Total Stockholder Return Our five-year total stockholder return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) performance, based on an investment of $100 in Broadcom common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal year 2016, has been very strong on both an absolute and relative basis. Although our one-year TSR increased significantly, we believe long-term TSR is a more relevant measure, as our stock price over short periods is impacted by market volatility and macroeconomic events unrelated to our underlying performance. As illustrated in the graph below&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our one-year TSR increased by 56.8% in Fiscal Year 2021. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our TSR increased by 34.0% annually on average over the past three fiscal years, and by 25.7% annually on average over the past five fiscal years. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our TSR for all three of these periods outperformed our peer group median and the S&#38;P 500 Index. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We significantly increased our absolute TSR since our initial public offering in 2009 by over 4,000%, with an annual average increase of 35.5%. 4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement PROXY SUMMARY Executive Compensation Executive Compensation Program Governance Our executive compensation program is designed to reward our executive officers for producing sustainable growth in share value, to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, and to attract and retain top talent. The table below highlights our key executive compensation program governance practices. Best Practices We Employ &#160; Practices We Do Not Employ &#160; &#252; Majority of named executive officer compensation tied to long-term performance X No excessive risk taking in incentive plan design &#252; Performance metrics directly tied to value creation for stockholders X No re-pricing of underwater stock options &#252; Caps on cash and equity incentive plan payouts X No excise tax gross-ups &#252; Annual risk assessment of compensation program X No supplemental retirement and pension benefits &#252; Engagement of an independent compensation consultant X No guaranteed bonuses &#252; CEO compensation reviewed and approved by the independent directors X No &#8220;single trigger&#8221; change in control payments or benefits &#252; Stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors X No perquisites, other than in modest amounts &#252; Anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy for employees and directors Fiscal Year 2021 Named Executive Officer Pay Mix The following charts compare the Fiscal Year 2021 target total direct compensation for our CEO and our other named executive officers (&#8220;NEOs&#8221;). Target total direct compensation consists of (i) base salary, (ii) target short-term incentives (&#8220;STI&#8221;) through our annual performance cash bonus plan (the &#8220;APB Plan&#8221;) and (iii) target long-term incentives (&#8220;LTI&#8221;) in the form of equity awards comprised of service-based restricted stock unit (&#8220;RSU&#8221;) awards and performance-based stock unit (&#8220;PSU&#8221;) awards based on the fair market value of the awards on the grant date or effective date, as the case may be. About half of our NEOs&#8217;, and more for our CEO&#8217;s, target total direct compensation in Fiscal Year 2021 was dependent upon our financial performance. The CEO chart includes an annual PSU award granted in Fiscal Year 2021 based on its fair market value on the December 15, 2020 effective date and assuming target performance. The Other NEO chart includes the equity awards granted in connection with the promotion of three NEOs&#58; (i) the service-based RSU awards and PSU awards granted to Ms. Spears, assuming target performance, and (ii) the annualized value of the service-based RSU awards and PSU awards, which vests over three years, granted to Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause, in each case based on the fair market value on the December 15, 2020 effective date and assuming target performance. In addition, the Other NEO chart includes the portion of the multi-year equity awards of service-based RSU awards and PSU awards (&#8220;PSU Multi-Year Awards&#8221;) granted to our NEOs in January 2019 (the &#8220;2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards&#8221;) that began vesting in March 2021, based on the January 2019 grant date fair market value and assuming target performance. The 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards vest on the same basis as if four annual equity grants were made on March 15 each year, beginning in 2019 for four successive years. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;5 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Code of Ethics and Business Conduct We are committed to strong corporate governance. Our Board has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the &#8220;Code of Ethics&#8221;) that is applicable to all members of our Board, employees, including our President and CEO and Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), and contractors. Our Code of Ethics guides us in how we conduct our business and work with each other, and reflects our values, standards and expectations. Any amendments to or waivers given to our executive officers or directors under the Code of Ethics will be disclosed on our website to the extent required under the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) rules. A copy of the Code of Ethics is available in the &#8220;Investor Center&#8212;Corporate Governance&#8212;Documents&#8221; section of our website or upon request to&#58; Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc., 1320 Ridder Park Drive, San&#160;Jose, California 95131 Corporate Governance Guidelines Our Board has adopted the Corporate Governance Guidelines that covers various topics relating to our Board and its activities. A copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is available in the &#8220;Investor Center&#8212;Corporate Governance&#8212;Documents&#8221; section of our website or upon request to&#58; Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc., 1320 Ridder Park Drive, San&#160;Jose, California 95131. Some of the governance best practices included in the Corporate Governance Guidelines are as follows&#58; &#8226; Protections Against Director Overboarding To ensure that our directors are not over-committed and have adequate time to fulfill their duties on our Board, directors may not serve on more than four other public company boards without prior approval, except that a director who also serves as the chief executive officer of a public company should not serve on more than two public company boards in addition to our Board. When considering any such requests, our Board carefully takes into consideration such director&#8217;s prior dedication of, and ability to continue to dedicate, sufficient time to fulfill the responsibilities required as a member of our Board and that the service with other public company boards does not and will not impact service on our Board. &#8226; Resignation Offered with Significant Job Change Any director who retires from or terminates his or her present employment, or who materially changes his or her position, is required to submit an offer of resignation as a director of our Board. This provides our Board the opportunity to evaluate whether the individual should continue to sit on our Board in light of the director&#8217;s new occupational status. Our Board may invite any such director to remain a director if our Board determines that continued access to such director&#8217;s knowledge, skills and experience is in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. &#8226; Resignation Offered at Age 75 Our Board does not currently believe that a mandatory retirement age for non-employee directors is necessary, and that continued service by a particular director may be in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. However, when a non-employee director reaches the age of 75 years, the director is required to offer such director&#8217;s resignation to our Board, to be effective as of the next annual meeting of stockholders. This allows our Board to evaluate the composition and needs of our Board and the interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. 6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Stock Ownership Guidelines Based on competitive market data and after consultation with the Compensation Committee&#8217;s independent compensation consultants, the stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and executive officers are as follows&#58; Position Aggregate Value* Non-employee Director 5x&#160;annual cash retainer CEO 6x&#160;base&#160;salary Executive Officer 3x base salary &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *Fair market value of common stock based on the closing price per share as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of valuation. Our non-employee directors and executive officers are expected to satisfy the applicable guidelines within five years of the date on which they become a director or an executive officer and to hold at least such minimum value in shares of common stock while they remain a director or an executive officer. Shares of common stock held in a trust or other estate-planning vehicle established by a non-employee director or an executive officer, which they beneficially own under SEC rules, count toward achieving the applicable level of stock ownership. Outstanding service-based RSU awards and PSU awards for which the performance criteria have been met count toward achieving the applicable level of stock ownership at a rate of 100%. Shares subject to outstanding stock options awards do not count towards achieving the applicable stock ownership level. As of the Record Date, all of our executive officers and non-employee directors had achieved the level of stock ownership set forth under the guidelines. Anti-Hedging and Trading Restrictions Our insider trading policy prohibits our directors and employees, including our executive officers, from hedging or pledging our securities, making short sales or trading in derivative securities related to our securities. CEO and Management Succession Planning Our Board is actively involved in the CEO and senior management succession planning. Our Board reviews the succession plan and potential successors to the CEO and senior management at least bi-annually. Our Board, with our CEO and Vice President of Human Resources, regularly discuss and review the composition of senior management, the qualifications and experience of the potential successors, and the development priorities and achievements of the potential successors. Our Board also engages with the potential internal candidates at least annually at Board meetings and in less formal settings. Our Board has developed a CEO succession plan, both on an interim and a longer-term basis. The interim plan would utilize internal candidates and become effective in the event our CEO unexpectedly becomes unable to perform his duties, in order to minimize potential disruption or loss of continuity to the business and operations. The longer-term CEO succession plan is also currently focused on the development of internal candidates, as well as on maintaining business and operational continuity. Corporate Social Responsibility Our Board, through the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (&#8220;NESG Committee&#8221;), oversees our environment, climate, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters, including our corporate social responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives. The NESG Committee receives quarterly updates from management on ESG matters and regularly updates the Board. In February 2022, we published our annual Environmental, Social and Governance Report for Fiscal Year 2021 (the &#8220;ESG Report&#8221;). In our ESG Report, we discuss our Fiscal Year 2021 ESG program and initiatives, including our products that help our customers with sustainability, our human rights program within our supply chain, our talented and dedicated workforce, and our environmental impact. We prepared our ESG Report leveraging the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (core option), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Semiconductors and Software &#38; IT Services Industry Standards and the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-Related Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;7 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our ESG Report is reviewed by the full Board. For more information regarding our corporate social responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives, see our ESG Report on the Citizenship and the Investor Center sections of our website. Our ESG Report and website are not part of or incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement. Stockholder Engagement We recognize the importance of actively engaging with and understanding the concerns of our stockholders. Our Lead Independent Director and chairperson of the Compensation Committee, together with members of management, annually engage with our stockholders in a robust stockholder engagement program. In Fiscal Year 2021, we contacted stockholder s beneficially owning over 60% of our then outstanding shares of common stock and engaged with stockholders owning over 57% o f our then outstanding stock. Our Lead Independent Director and chairperson of the Compensation Committee, along with our Chairman of the Board and members of management, participated in these engagements and discussed a variety of topics, including the proposed amendment and restatement of our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2012 Plan&#8221;), executive management promotions, executive compensation, equity compensation, and ESG corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Following the 2021 annual meeting and continuing into Fiscal Year 2022, we continued to meet with our stockholders to discuss the progress of our ESG corporate social responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives. Stockholder Communications With Our Board You may communicate with our Board at the following address&#58; The Board of Directors Broadcom Inc. c&#47;o&#160;Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer 1320 Ridder Park Drive San&#160;Jose, California 95131 Communications are distributed to our Board or to any individual director, as appropriate, depending on the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication. Communications that are unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable will be excluded, but will be made available to any director upon request. 8&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement BOARD OF DIRECTORS BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board oversees the conduct of our business by our senior management, provides guidance on our strategic and business planning processes, is principally responsible for the succession planning for our key executives, including our CEO, and ensures that the long-term interests of stockholders are being served. Director Independence Our Board annually reviews the independence of each director and nominee and considers whether such individual has a material relationship with Broadcom that could compromise their ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. For the purposes of assessing a director&#8217;s independence, our Board reviewed transactions and relationships between Broadcom and an entity where a director or nominee serves as a director and&#47;or is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of such entity, or where a director or nominee for director serves on a non-employee advisory board of, or in a non-employee advisory capacity to, such an entity. While Dr. Samueli is now considered independent under the Nasdaq Stock Market (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;) listing standards, Dr. Samueli would not be deemed independent until December 2023 under Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis proxy voting policies. Accordingly, our Board has determined that Messrs. Fernandez, Hartenstein, Low and You and Mses. Bryant, Delly and Page, representing seven of our nine director nominees, are currently &#8220;independent directors.&#8221; Board Leadership Structure Our Board currently believes that Broadcom and its stockholders are best served by a Board leadership structure in which the roles of the CEO and the Chairman of the Board are held by different individuals, and that there be a Lead Independent Director if the Chairman is not independent. Under this structure our CEO is generally responsible for setting the strategic direction of Broadcom and for the day-to-day management of our operations. The independent Chairman or the Lead Independent Director, as applicable, provides strong independent leadership to assist our Board in fulfilling its oversight role of management and our risk management practices, approves the agenda for Board meetings and presides over Board meetings and over the meetings of our independent directors in executive session. Our Board annually reviews its leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve Broadcom and its stockholders. Currently, Mr.&#160;Tan serves as our President and CEO, Dr. Samueli serves as our Chairman of the Board and Mr. Hartenstein serves as our Lead Independent Director. As a result of the review, our Board has decided that the current leadership structure and division of responsibilities should be continued. Director Nominations In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board seeks individuals to serve as directors who have the highest personal and professional integrity, demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment, and diversity of skills, experience and background appropriate for the business and operations of Broadcom. When evaluating director candidates, the NESG Committee seeks to ensure that our Board has the requisite skills, experience and expertise, and that our Board consist of persons with appropriately diverse and independent backgrounds.

See &#8220; Other Information &#8211; Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for the 2023 Annual Meeting &#8221; below for information on the requirements for director nominations, including nominations using proxy access. Director Attendance and Meetings Our Board held 11 meetings during Fiscal Year 2021 and our independent directors met at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management present. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of our Board and all committees of our Board on which the director served during Fiscal Year 2021. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that each director is expected to attend the annual meetings of our stockholders. All of our directors attended the annual meeting in April 2021. Board Evaluations Our Board is committed to reviewing its performance through an annual evaluation process, which is overseen by the NESG Committee. Through the evaluations, our directors provide feedback on our Board and its committees and our Board assesses its processes and overall effectiveness. The Chairman of the Board and the Lead Independent Director report the results to our full Board and the Chairpersons of each committee report the results to their respective committees. Board Risk Oversight Our Board believes that evaluating Broadcom&#8217;s most critical risks is one of its most important areas of oversight. Our Board regularly reviews and discusses with management risks related to operations, liquidity, credit, cybersecurity, climate&#47;environment, compensation programs, workforce retention and senior management succession. In addition, each committee is responsible for the oversight of specific areas of risk and report regularly to our Board on matters relating to those risks. Management reports, at least annually, on our risks and risk management practices to the relevant committees and the full Board. Committee Primary Areas of Risk Oversight Audit &#8226; Oversee financial reporting process, accounting policies and internal controls &#8226; Evaluate risks related to financial reporting, accounting, auditing, tax, cybersecurity and climate &#8226; Evaluate exposures and risks related to data privacy and information technology security and controls, including our cybersecurity performance and risk profile, and the steps management takes to monitor, control and report such exposure &#8226; Review and approve related party transactions Compensation &#8226; Oversee our compensation plans, program and policies &#8226; Evaluate the relationship between risk management policies and practices, business strategy and officers&#8217; compensation &#8226; Evaluate and provide input on CEO and senior management succession planning NESG &#8226; Review and evaluate corporate governance framework, including our governance guidelines and policies &#8226; Evaluate the structure and composition of our Board and committees, including succession planning and diversity, and related policies and procedures &#8226; Oversee our corporate responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives, including environment, climate, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance matters Cybersecurity Risk Management Our Board is actively involved in overseeing our data privacy and information technology risk management, with increased oversight on cybersecurity. Our management reviews with the Audit Committee our data privacy and information 10&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement BOARD OF DIRECTORS technology security policies, practices and protective measures, current and projected threats to our data privacy and information security, cybersecurity incidents and related risks. The Audit Committee and management at least quarterly update our Board on our cybersecurity performance and risk profile, and the effectiveness of our security processes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Audit Committee and management have been focused on ensuring that we have secure remote access with trusted devices, endpoint security controls and infrastructure resiliency. As part of this process, we enhanced our security incident response procedures to address risks specific to remote working conditions. We continue to improve our security posture with process improvement, testing and investments where necessary. Compensation Risk Assessment Our management conducted its annual review of our compensation policies and practices for our employees, as they relate to our risk management, and reported their findings in January 2022 to the Compensation Committee. To mitigate compensation-related risk, our compensation policies and practices (described in more detail under &#8220; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &#8221; and &#8220; Executive Compensatio n&#8221; below) balance short- and long-term goals and awards, as well as the mix of the cash and equity components. We also have policies in place to mitigate compensation-related risk, including executive stock ownership guidelines, hedging and pledging prohibitions, and oversight by our Compensation Committee whose members are independent directors. Based upon this risk assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation program does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking, and is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Broadcom. Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (&#8220;Meridian&#8221;), the Compensation Committee&#8217;s independent consultants beginning in Fiscal Year 2022, reviewed the risk assessment and supports the Compensation Committee&#8217;s conclusion.

Upon the recommendation of the NESG Committee, our Board nominated the nine individuals below for election as directors, all of whom are currently directors. Our Board expects that each of the director nominees will be available to serve as a director. Stockholders may not vote their proxies for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named below. In the event a director nominee resigns or otherwise becomes unwilling or unable to serve after the mailing of the Internet Notice but before the Annual Meeting, our intention would be to make a public announcement of such resignation and either reduce the size of our Board or appoint a substitute nominee, in accordance with our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the &#8220;Bylaws&#8221;). If we reduce the size of our Board, this would reduce the number of nominees to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Votes received in respect of such director would not be counted in such circumstances. In the event that we instead propose to elect a substitute nominee at the Annual Meeting to fill any such vacancy, it is intended that the shares represented by the proxy will be voted for such substitute nominee. Our Board believes that each director nominee has the experience, qualification, personal and professional integrity, and diversity of background and understands our business and industry. After careful consideration, our Board believes that each director nominee has demonstrated the willingness and the ability to dedicate adequate time and attention to fulfill the responsibilities required as a director and that the service with other public companies does not and will not impact service on our Board. We also believe that the director nominees together have the skills and experience to form a board that is well suited to oversee the risks and opportunities facing Broadcom.

The Audit Committee has re-appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (&#8220;PwC&#8221;) as our independent auditors for Fiscal Year 2022. Our Board and the Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of PwC is in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. We expect a representative from PwC to be present at the Annual Meeting. This representative will have the opportunity to make a statement if the representative so desires and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. Our stockholders are not required to ratify the appointment of PwC as our independent auditors. However, we are submitting the appointment of PwC to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event of a negative vote, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to continue to retain PwC. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. Principal Accounting Fees and Services Set forth below are the fees for all services rendered by PwC to Broadcom for Fiscal Years 2021 and 2020. Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 ($ in thousands) Audit Fees $ 13,965 $ 16,131 Audit-Related Fees &#8212; &#8212; Tax Fees 1,731 2,477 All Other Fees 24 79 Total $ 15,720 $ 18,687 Audit Fees consist of fees billed for professional services provided in connection with the integrated audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, which includes an audit of internal controls over financial reporting, the review of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, and audit services that are normally provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years, such as statutory audits, comfort letters and consents. The fees include audit fees related to business combination accounting for our recently closed acquisitions, inclusive of the acquisition of the Symantec Enterprise Security business in Fiscal Year 2020. Tax Fees consist of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance and tax consulting. Corporate tax services encompass a variety of permissible services, including assistance with transfer pricing documentation, expatriate income tax matters, local tax compliance matters, tax audits, and tax credit documentation. All Other Fees consist of fees for professional services rendered by PwC for permissible non-audit services. In Fiscal Years 2021 and 2020, these fees included services for various license and compliance reviews and a license for specialized accounting research software. In considering the nature of the services provided by PwC, the Audit Committee determined that the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. The Audit Committee discussed these services with PwC and our management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulation concerning independent registered public accounting firms&#8217; independence promulgated by the SEC, as well as by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Other than as stated above, no fees were billed to Broadcom by PwC for Fiscal Years 2021 and 2020. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;21 PROPOSAL 2&#58; RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Services Policy All engagements with our independent registered public accounting firm, regardless of amount, must be authorized in advance by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated its pre-approval authority to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee, provided that any matters approved in such manner are presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Pursuant to the charter of the Audit Committee, committee approval of non-audit services (other than review and attest services) is not required, if such services fall within available exceptions established by the SEC. However, to date, the Audit Committee&#8217;s policy has been to approve all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm and our management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the Audit Committee&#8217;s pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date. During Fiscal Years 2021 and 2020, all services provided to Broadcom by PwC were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Our Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal Year 2022. 22&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board with its oversight responsibilities regarding the following&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the quality and integrity of Broadcom&#8217;s financial statements and internal controls&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the appointment, compensation, retention, qualifications and independence of Broadcom&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the performance of Broadcom&#8217;s internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Broadcom&#8217;s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements&#59;&#160;and &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;related party transactions. Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Statements In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed Broadcom&#8217;s financial statements for the fiscal year ended October&#160;31, 2021 (&#8220;Fiscal Year 2021&#8221;) with Broadcom&#8217;s management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (&#8220;PwC&#8221;). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with PwC, with and without management present, Broadcom&#8217;s internal controls over financial reporting and the overall quality of Broadcom&#8217;s financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) and the SEC. Based on the Audit Committee&#8217;s review and discussions noted herein, as well as such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements for Fiscal Year 2021 be included in Broadcom&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal Year 2021 for filing with the SEC. Independence and Pre-Approval Policy The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant&#8217;s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed the independence of PwC with that firm. The Audit Committee&#8217;s policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by Broadcom&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm. For each proposed service, PwC provides the Audit Committee with a description of the service and sufficient information to confirm PwC&#8217;s determination that the provision of such service will not impair its independence. The Audit Committee reviewed and pre-approved all audit and non-audit services performed by PwC during Fiscal Year 2021 in accordance with established procedures. Independent Auditor Tenure and Rotation As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm. PwC has been Broadcom&#8217;s independent auditor since 2006. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having PwC as its independent auditor. These include&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Higher quality audit work and accounting advice due to PwC&#8217;s institutional knowledge of and familiarity with Broadcom&#8217;s business and operations, accounting policies and financial systems, and internal control framework. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Operational efficiencies and a resulting lower fee structure because of PwC&#8217;s history and familiarity with Broadcom&#8217;s business. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the process for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the lead audit engagement partner every five years. At the Audit Committee&#8217;s instruction, PwC selects candidates to be considered for this role, who are then interviewed by members of Broadcom&#8217;s senior management. After discussing the results of senior management&#8217;s interviews, the Audit Committee interviews the candidates. The Audit Committee then considers the appointment and votes on the selection. The Audit Committee and the Board approved the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Broadcom&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October&#160;30, 2022. AUDIT COMMITTEE Justine F. Page, Chairperson Gayla J. Delly Raul J. Fernandez Harry L. You Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;23 PROPOSAL 3&#58; SAY ON PAY PROPOSAL 3&#58; ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS In accordance with the requirements of Section&#160;14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as described in the &#8220; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &#8221; and the compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosure under &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8221; in this Proxy Statement. We currently hold the say-on-pay vote annually and expect the next say-on-pay vote will occur at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. O u r executive compensation program, structured around the achievement of near-term financial and operational targets and longer-term business objectives and strategies, is designed to reward our executive officers for producing sustainable growth and to align their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders, as well as attract and retain top talent. When setting financial and operational targets for the short-term incentives and performance goals for the long-term incentives, the Compensation Committee judiciously determines, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, the target levels and peer index that would significantly enhance stockholder value, be difficult to attain and require substantial effort to achieve by our executive officers. For Fiscal Year 2021, we increased revenue by 15% and operating income by 112%, and our total shareholder return increased by nearly 57%. We believe the compensation paid to our NEOs for Fiscal Year 2021 appropriately reflects and rewards our executive officers&#8217; contributions to Broadcom&#8217;s strong performance despite the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and the continued disruption in normal business activities, including the ongoing supply chain constraints, and is aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Consistent with our previous commitment, we did not grant regular annual equity incentive awards to Ms. Spears, Messrs. Brazeal and Krause, and Dr. Kawwas in Fiscal Year 2021 because they were granted multi-year equity awards in January 2019. Stockholders are being asked to approve the following resolution&#58; &#8220;RESOLVED THAT stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Broadcom&#8217;s named executive officers, as disclosed in &#8220; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &#8221; and in the compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosure under &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8221; in this Proxy Statement.&#8221; In deciding how to vote on this proposal, stockholders are encouraged to read the &#8220; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &#8221; and &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8221; sections of this Proxy Statement. While the vote on this resolution is advisory and not binding, the Compensation Committee and our Board values input from stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote on this resolution when considering future executive compensation decisions. Our Board recommends a vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis. 24&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following Compensation Discussion&#160;and Analysis (the &#8220;CD&#38;A&#8221;) describes the philosophy, objectives and structure of our Fiscal Year 2021 executive compensation program. This CD&#38;A is intended to be read in conjunction with the tables and other information beginning on page&#160; 45 , which provide further historical compensation information for our NEOs, who are our CEO, CFO and three other most highly compensated executive officers serving at the end of Fiscal Year 2021. Our NEOs for Fiscal Year 2021 were&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hock E. Tan, President and Chief Executive Officer &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kirsten M. Spears, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mark D. Brazeal, Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charlie B. Kawwas, Ph.D., Chief Operating Officer &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thomas H. Krause, Jr., President, Broadcom Software Group Executive Summary&#58; Fiscal Year 2021 Company Performance and Key Pay Decisions Despite the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and challenges to our business, our Fiscal Year 2021 performance continued to be strong. Our executive compensation program is structured around the achievement of near-term financial and operational targets and longer-term business objectives and strategies. We believe in rewarding excellent performance and reflecting underperformance, if that occurs. We seek to closely align our executive officers&#8217; interests with those of our stockholders and, accordingly, allocate a significant portion of our executives&#8217; compensation opportunity to RSUs, the value of which fluctuates based on our stock price, and other performance-based compensation, which is dependent on our TSR performance relative to that of our peers and our financial performance. Our Fiscal Year 2021 Performance Financial Results Highlights Our Fiscal Year 2021 financial results highlights* include increases in&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Year-over-year revenue to $27,450 million, 15% above Fiscal Year 2020. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;GAAP operating income to $8,519 million, 112% above Fiscal Year 2020&#59; and non-GAAP operating income to $15,912 million, 23% above Fiscal Year 2020. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Net cash provided by operating activities to $13,764 million, 14% above Fiscal Year 2020&#59; and free cash flow to $13,321 million, 15% above Fiscal Year 2020. *See Appendix A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;25 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Return of Capital to Stockholders Our strong cash flow in Fiscal Year 2020 enabled us to return an aggregate of $7,511 million to our stockholders during Fiscal Year 2021, consisting of $6,212 million in cash dividends and $1,299 million for the elimination of shares withheld to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. In addition, our strong free cash flow in Fiscal Year 2021 enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $4.10 per share in the first quarter of our Fiscal Year 2022, an increase of 14% over the quarterly dividend paid in Fiscal Year 2021. Dividend Increase YoY% 23% 11% Total Stockholder Return Our five-year TSR performance, based on an investment of $100 in Broadcom common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal year 2016, has been very strong on both an absolute and relative basis. Although our one-year TSR increased significantly, we believe long-term TSR is a more relevant measure, as our stock price over short periods is frequently impacted by market volatility and macroeconomic events unrelated to our underlying performance. As Illustrated in the graph below&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our one-year TSR increased by 56.8% in Fiscal Year 2021. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our TSR increased by 34.0% annually on average over the past three fiscal years, and by 25.7% annually on average over the past five fiscal years. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our TSR for all three of these periods outperformed our peer group median and the S&#38;P 500 Index. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We significantly increased our absolute TSR since our initial public offering in 2009 by over 4,003%, with an annual average increase of 35.5%. 26&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Stockholder Engagement During Fiscal Year 2021, our Lead Independent Director and chairperson of the Compensation Committee, along with our Chairman of the Board and members of management, engaged with our stockholders and obtained feedback on our executive compensation program. This resulted in discussions with our largest stockholders on a variety of executive compensation related topics, including the proposed amendment and restatement of our 2012 Plan, executive management promotions and long-term incentive compensation. Say-on-Pay At the 2021 annual meeting, we submitted the compensation of our NEOs to a non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders (the &#8220;say-on-pay proposal&#8221;). Stockholders representing 95% of the shares present and voting on the matter were in favor of the proposal. In light of this approval, the Compensation Committee did not make any significant changes to our executive compensation structure. Fiscal Year 2021 Compensation Highlights Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Payouts Reflect Fiscal Year 2021 Company Performance Payouts under the APB Plan were tied to challenging pre-established annual corporate and divisional performance goals, as well as the individual contributions and performance of each executive. The APB Plan payouts reflected the following considerations&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Compensation Committee set the two Fiscal Year 2021 corporate performance goals &#8211; revenue and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin (as defined in &#8220; Elements of Executive Compensation &#8211; Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Plan &#8221; below) &#8211; at target attainment levels that would potentially enhance stockholder value and require substantial effort to achieve. Both the revenue and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin targets were set significantly above our Fiscal Year 2020 actual performance. The divisional performance goals were also set at levels difficult to attain by the division and the NEO in charge of the division. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our Fiscal Year 2021 revenue, which increased 15% over Fiscal Year 2020, and our adjusted non-GAAP operating margin both exceeded the maximum attainment levels, resulting in 150.0% attainment of the corporate performance goals under the APB Plan. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The divisional performance goals unrelated to revenue and operating margin exceeded target performance levels. This combined with the attainment of our corporate goals resulted in payouts for all eligible employees under both our executive and employee APB plans. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Compensation Committee considers our CEO&#8217;s recommendations (other than with respect to himself) and judiciously applies individual performance multipliers to recognize the extraordinary efforts of our executives and exceptional performance with respect to our corporate performance goals and divisional results. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Compensation Committee (and the independent directors in the case of our CEO) carefully assessed the extraordinary efforts of our executive officers and our significant increase in revenue and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin year-over-year despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints. Based on the assessment, our NEOs received individual performance multipliers of 100% to 150%. Our CEO (upon approval of the independent directors) received an individual performance multiplier of 150%, resulting in a payout of 225% of his target bonus. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;27 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Compensation Changes in Connection with Promotions Ms. Spears, Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause were promoted and assumed broader responsibilities to ensure the long-term stability of our leadership and culture. Their new roles are CFO, Chief Operating Officer and President, Broadcom Software Group (which was previously known as the Infrastructure Software Group), respectively. The Compensation Committee approved the following changes in recognition of the competitive talent market and the executives&#8217; increased responsibilities. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms. Spears, Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause received base salary increases effective December 10, 2020. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms. Spears&#8217; APB Plan bonus target percentage was increased to 100% of eligible earnings effective December 10, 2020. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The performance goals under the APB Plan for Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause were changed to the attainment of overall corporate goals instead of divisional performance goals effective December 10, 2020. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms. Spears, Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause were granted promotion equity incentive awards for their increased responsibilities due to their promotions that were not anticipated when they were granted the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards. These promotion equity incentive awards consist of 50% service-based RSU awards and 50% PSU awards at target. The aggregate target market value of each of the promotion equity incentive awards for Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause that the Compensation Committee approved was $15,000,000&#59; however, the value of each of these promotion equity incentive awards in the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table &#8221; below is $20,115,046 because it is the accounting grant date fair value under ASC 718 on April 5, 2021, when the stockholders approved the 2012 Plan and the actual grant date for accounting purposes. The factors provided below in the &#8220; Equity Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2021 &#8221; section explain the difference between the target market value approved by the Compensation Committee and the accounting grant date fair value. See the &#8220; Elements of Executive Compensation &#8211; Long-Term Incentive Compensation &#8221; section below for more information relating to these awards. There were no other increases to NEO base salaries or target bonus opportunities in Fiscal Year 2021. Further, Ms. Spears, Messrs. Brazeal and Krause and Dr. Kawwas were not granted regular annual equity incentive awards in Fiscal Year 2021 because of their previously granted 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards. PSU Grant for our CEO Mr. Tan received an annual PSU award due to the importance of his continued commitment, his retention in a competitive talent market and his leadership in continued stockholder value creation. Absent this award, Mr. Tan would not have had any unvested equity awards after June 2021. See the &#8220; Elements of Executive Compensation &#8211; Long-Term Incentive Compensation &#8221; section below for more information relating to this award. Overview of Our Executive Compensation Program The Compensation Committee believes that, in general, about half of our executive officers&#8217;, and more of our CEO&#8217;s, target total direct compensation should be dependent upon our performance. Accordingly, our executive compensation program is designed to reward our executive officers for producing sustainable growth in stockholder value consistent with our strategic plan, align their interests with the interests of our stockholders, and attract and retain top talent. 28&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Target Total Direct Compensation Our annual total direct compensation consists of three principal elements&#58; &#160; Base&#160;Salary Individual salaries reflect the executive&#8217;s responsibilities and sustained individual performance. Salaries are set to be competitive with market and industry norms. Short-Term Incentives&#160;(STI) The APB Plan is intended to reward the achievement of pre-established annual corporate and divisional performance goals, as well as the individual contributions and performance of each executive. In Fiscal Year 2021, our corporate performance goals were (i) revenue and (ii) adjusted non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue. Pre-established attainment levels are designed to significantly enhance stockholder value, to be difficult to attain and to require substantial effort to achieve. Long-Term Incentives (LTI) RSU awards and PSU awards are granted to encourage and reward the efforts of our executives to grow sustainable, long-term stockholder value. These equity awards further encourage retention and mitigate compensation-related risks. The following charts compare the Fiscal Year 2021 target total direct compensation for our CEO and our other NEOs. Target total direct compensation consists of (i) base salary, (ii) target STI through the APB Plan, and (iii) target LTI in the form of equity awards comprised of service-based RSU awards and PSU awards based on the fair market value of the awards on the grant date or the effective date, as the case may be. As shown in the charts below, approximately 95% of our NEOs&#8217; target total direct compensation in Fiscal Year 2021 is comprised of variable compensation elements. The CEO chart includes Mr. Tan&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2021 PSU award based on its fair market value on the December 15, 2020 effective date and assuming target performance. The Other NEO chart includes the equity awards granted in connection with the promotion of three NEOs&#58; (i) the service-based RSU awards and PSU awards granted to Ms. Spears, assuming target performance, and (ii) the annualized value of the service-based RSU awards and PSU awards, which vests over three years, granted to Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause, in each case based on the fair market value on the December 15, 2020 effective date and assuming target performance. In addition, the Other NEO chart includes the portion of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards granted to the NEOs other than our CEO in January 2019 that began vesting in March 2021, based on the January 2019 grant date fair market value and assuming target performance. The 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards vest on the same basis as if four annual equity grants were made on March 15 each year, beginning in 2019 for four successive years. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;29 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Executive Compensation Program Governance The table below highlights our key executive compensation program governance practices. &#160; Best Practices We Employ &#160; &#160; Practices We Do Not Employ &#160; &#252; Majority of NEO compensation tied to long-term performance X No excessive risk taking in incentive plan designs &#252; Performance metrics directly tied to value creation for stockholders X No re-pricing of underwater stock options &#252; Caps on cash and equity incentive plan payouts X No excise tax gross-ups &#252; Annual risk assessment of compensation programs X No supplemental retirement or pension benefits &#252; Engagement of an independent compensation consultant X No guaranteed bonuses &#252; CEO compensation reviewed and approved by the independent directors X No &#8220;single trigger &#8221; change in control payments or benefits &#252; Stock ownership guidelines for all executive officers and directors (see page 7 ) X No perquisites, other than in modest amounts &#252; Anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy for employees and directors (see page 7 ) Compensation Philosophy and Objectives Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve the following&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;attract qualified, experienced and talented executives in a highly competitive market&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;retain, motivate and reward these executives, whose skills, knowledge and performance are critical to our on-going success&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;encourage our executives to focus on the achievement of our corporate financial and operational performance goals by aligning their APB Plan payout to the achievement of pre-established annual corporate and divisional goals, as well as the individual contributions and performance of each executive&#59; and &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;align our executives&#8217; interests with our stockholders interests by linking a significant portion of each executive&#8217;s target total direct compensation opportunity to stockholder returns in the form of PSUs that are subject to the attainment of pre-established performance-based objectives, and the rest in the form of service-based RSUs, the value of which fluctuates based on our stock price. Equity awards are a long-term retention tool for our key executives. When granting equity awards or when recommending to the independent directors an equity award grant to our CEO, the Compensation Committee considers each executive&#8217;s level of experience and expertise and overall value to Broadcom, as well as how much vested and unvested equity the executive then holds. The Compensation Committee has adopted a compensation philosophy that is designed to keep our executives&#8217; target total direct compensation competitive with the compensation of executives in comparable positions at other companies in our compensation peer group and third-party market pay surveys. Generally, target total cash compensation falls below the median of the competitive market, but in combination with equity, target total direct compensation may be higher. The Compensation Committee bases its decisions on the needs of Broadcom and an executive&#8217;s level of sustained performance, expertise, experience, marketability and internal equitability. While the Compensation Committee and our Board generally consider the accounting and tax implications of their executive compensation decisions, neither element has been a material consideration in the compensation awarded to our NEOs historically. Stockholder Engagement Each year we engage with our stockholders and obtain feedback on our executive compensation program. In Fiscal Year 2021, we contacted stockholder s beneficially owning over 60% of our then outstanding shares of common stock and engaged with stockholders owning over 57% o f our then outstanding stock. Our Lead Independent Director and chairperson of the Compensation Committee, along with our Chairman of the Board and members of management, participated in these engagements and discussed a variety of executive compensation related topics, including the 30&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS proposed amendment and restatement of our 2012 Plan, executive management promotions and long-term incentive compensation. These stockholders indicated that they continue to be generally supportive of our executive compensation actions and decisions and program design. The feedback received from our stockholders was reported to both the Compensation Committee and the Board. Compensation Determination Process Role of the Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee devotes significant time throughout the year to our executive compensation program to ensure that it aligns executive pay with corporate performance and incentivizes our executives to pursue corporate financial, operational and strategic goals that will create sustainable, long-term stockholder value. &#160; The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation of our key executives, except our CEO, for whom the Compensation Committee makes recommendations for review and approval by the independent directors of our Board. Individual Executive Compensation Assessment . In addition to market compensation data provided by its compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee (and, in the case of our CEO, the independent directors) considers the following information, among other factors, for each executive when determining his or her compensation&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;current base salary, target APB Plan opportunities (and prior fiscal year payouts), the accumulated value of outstanding and unvested equity awards and other benefits&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the individual&#8217;s overall performance, as well as the importance of the role, the individual&#8217;s knowledge and skills to Broadcom, the individual&#8217;s leadership within Broadcom and the individual&#8217;s contributions to Broadcom&#8217;s culture&#59; and &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;our CEO&#8217;s recommendation on compensation and individual performance (other than for himself). This information helps the Compensation Committee and the independent directors to understand the long-term retentive elements and total compensation delivered to our executives. Internal Pay Parity . While we do not maintain a formal policy regarding internal pay parity, it is often considered by the Compensation Committee and the independent directors when determining compensation. Consistent with market practice, our CEO is compensated at a higher level than our other executives due to his higher level of responsibility, accountability and experience. Given Mr.&#160;Tan&#8217;s responsibility for our overall performance, the independent directors believe that compensating him at a higher level than our other executives and weighting his total compensation more heavily toward long-term, performance-based incentive compensation is consistent with market practice, appropriately reflects his contributions and directly aligns his incentives with the interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, Mr.&#160;Tan receives more of his target total direct compensation in the form of LTI compensation through PSU awards as compared to our other executives. Compensation Risk Oversight . While our Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the Compensation Committee annually reviews and discusses the risks that relate to all of our compensation policies and practices, including incentive and commission arrangements below the executive level. The Compensation Committee does not believe that our compensation policies or practices create potential material market risk for Broadcom. Role of Compensation Consultant In Fiscal Year 2021, Compensia, Inc. (&#8220;Compensia&#8221;) provided consulting services to the Compensation Committee and the independent directors, including assessments of executive and non-employee director compensation based on analyses of competitive market compensation data. In addition, the Compensation Committee relied on Compensia for periodic updates on regulatory developments and market trends related to executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Compensia did not provide any other services to Broadcom except advising the Compensation Committee and the independent directors on compensation-related matters. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Compensia pursuant to the six independence factors set forth in the SEC and Nasdaq rules and concluded that Compensia was independent and its work for the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflict of interest. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;31 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Compensation Competitive Analysis The Compensation Committee works with its compensation consultant to develop a meaningful compensation peer group for purposes of understanding competitive market compensation practices. This peer group is reviewed and updated annually as necessary. The peer group is used for comparative purposes only. The Compensation Committee does not benchmark any pay elements or target total direct compensation to a specific percentile. In the absence of relevant peer group data, the Compensation Committee reviews industry-based market pay survey data (&#8220;market survey data&#8221;), such as the Radford Global Compensation Database Survey and Mercer High Tech Salary Survey (Asia). In October 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the compensation peer group for Fiscal Year 2021, which appears below and was developed in consultation with Compensia. The following selection criteria were considered as guidelines when developing the compensation peer group&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Revenues &#58; comparability across annual revenue, generally 0.5 to 2.0 times that of Broadcom&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Market capitalization &#58; market capitalization that generally fall between 0.3 to 3.0 times that of Broadcom&#59; and &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Industry &#58; companies in semiconductor-related and other technology-focused industries having a similar scale.

(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents publicly reported revenue for the trailing four quarters ended May 3, 2020. In October 2021, the compensation peer group was updated for Fiscal Year 2022 to reflect the growth in our revenue and market capitalization. Booking Holdings was removed due to its revenues and market capitalization falling outside of the selection criteria set forth above. Advanced Micro Devices was added to the compensation peer group, which is viewed as an appropriate peer because its revenues, market capitalization and industry better aligned with the applicable relevant selection criteria set forth above. Elements of Executive Compensation The principal elements of our executive compensation program are&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;base salary&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;an annual cash incentive bonus plan&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;LTI compensation in the form of equity awards, including a substantial weighting toward PSU awards&#59; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;severance and change in control payments and benefits&#59; and &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;modest perquisites and other personal benefits. 32&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Base Salary We believe that a competitive base salary is an important element of our executive compensation program designed to attract, engage and retain our executive officers. Base salaries provide fixed, baseline compensation and are set at levels intended to reflect an executive&#8217;s sustained individual performance and level and scope of responsibility, to be within a competitive range for similar positions at the companies in our compensation peer group and&#47;or market survey data, and to take into account internal pay parity among our executive officers. The Compensation Committee also reviews our economic and business conditions and outlook. The base salaries of our key executives are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. Our CEO makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to base salary adjustments for our executive officers (other than himself). The Compensation Committee also reviews and considers many factors in determining individual performance for the purposes of adjusting base salaries. These factors include division performance against budget, achievement of divisional goals, new product introductions and corporate strategy implementation. In December 2020, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Compensia and our CEO, increased the base salaries of Ms. Spears, Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause in connection with their promotions to positions with increased responsibilities and to bring their base salaries more in line with the competitive market levels for their new positions. These increases took effect on December 10, 2020 and are shown in the following table. Dr. Kawwas&#8217; and Mr. Krause&#8217;s annual base salary will remain effective through December 15, 2023. No other changes were made to the base salaries of our NEOs in Fiscal Year 2021. NEO Title Base Salary end of Fiscal Year 2020 Base Salary end of Fiscal Year 2021 %&#160;Change Hock E. Tan President and Chief Executive Officer $ 1,200,000 $ 1,200,000 0.0% Kirsten M. Spears Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer $ 332,964 $ 400,000 20.1% Mark D.

Krause, Jr. President, Broadcom Software Group $ 500,000 $ 700,000 40.0% Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Plan We believe that a significant portion of our executive officers&#8217; target total direct compensation should be dependent upon performance. Accordingly, we use the APB Plan to provide a performance-based annual cash incentive bonus opportunity for our executive officers. The APB Plan is designed to encourage and motivate our executive officers to achieve our overall corporate goals for the fiscal year, as well as divisional goals where appropriate, and to drive positive contributions to Broadcom&#8217;s growth and performance. Each executive officer is annually assigned a specified target annual cash incentive bonus opportunity under the APB Plan, expressed as a percentage of the executive officer&#8217;s eligible earnings. The Compensation Committee considers compensation peer group and market data in determining the executive officer&#8217;s target annual cash incentive opportunity. In the case of our CEO, the Compensation Committee includes the data in its recommendation to the independent directors. The Compensation Committee and the independent directors also consider other factors that influence corporate and operational results, such as the executive&#8217;s experience, performance, leadership and responsibility. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;33 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Fiscal Year 2021 APB Plan In consultation with Compensia, the Compensation Committee increased the target annual cash incentive opportunity for Ms. Spears to 100% of her eligible earnings from 50%, effective December 10, 2020, in connection with her promotion to CFO and to bring it in line with the competitive market levels for her position and the other NEOs. The other NEOs&#8217; target annual cash incentive bonus opportunity as a percentage of their eligible earnings did not change in Fiscal Year 2021. NEO Fiscal Year 2020 APB&#160;Plan&#160;Target&#160;Bonus (as a % of eligible earnings) Fiscal Year 2021 APB&#160;Plan&#160;Target&#160;Bonus (as a % of eligible earnings) Hock E.

Krause, Jr. 100% 100% Annual cash incentive bonuses under the APB Plan are calculated as follows&#58; Bonuses under the APB Plan are payable to our NEOs in cash, with the exception of our CEO in certain circumstances. In the event the independent directors assign our CEO an individual performance multiplier (discussed in more detail below) greater than 100%, they may elect to pay the difference between the dollar amount of our CEO&#8217;s actual annual cash incentive bonus payout and the dollar amount of his annual cash incentive bonus payout calculated using a performance factor of 100% in the form of an equity award. The type and terms of any such equity award are determined by the independent directors. The independent directors believe that this feature gives them the flexibility to further incentivize our CEO to focus on our mid-term to long-term performance and value creation for our stockholders and to provide continued retention of our CEO. Corporate Performance Components The corporate performance goals for the Fiscal Year 2021 APB Plan were&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;revenue threshold attainment level set at $23,750 million, target set at $25,000 million and maximum set at $26,250 million&#59; and &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;adjusted non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue (referred to as &#8220;adjusted non-GAAP operating margin&#8221;) threshold attainment level set at 57.3%, target set at 58.3% and maximum set at 60.3%. These performance levels were established by the Compensation Committee, based on the recommendation of our CEO, and approved by the independent directors. As shown below in &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 APB Plan Attainment, &#8221; the target levels were set significantly above our Fiscal Year 2020 actual performance levels and were designed to significantly enhance stockholder value, while requiring substantial effort to achieve. Each goal carried an equal weighting of 50% of the corporate performance component. Divisional Performance Components The Compensation Committee, taking into account our CEO&#8217;s recommendations, determined an executive officer&#8217;s divisional goals and set their weightings based on its assessment of the business requirements of the particular division to which the goals related and the relative importance of the goals to the division. Each divisional goal was set by the Compensation Committee to be difficult to attain and to require substantial effort by the division and the NEO in charge of the division to achieve. The table below under &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 APB Plan Attainment and Payout Amounts &#8221; sets forth the divisional goals for Fiscal Year 2021. 34&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Individual Performance Multiplier The final payouts under the APB Plan included the effect of a non-subjective individual performance multiplier applied judiciously to recognize the extraordinary efforts of our executives despite adverse market conditions or exceptional performance with respect to our corporate goals or an executive&#8217;s division results. Each individual NEO&#8217;s performance multiplier (other than our CEO&#8217;s) is approved by the Compensation Committee based, in part, on the recommendations of our CEO and by the independent directors, in the case of our CEO, with input from the Compensation Committee. In evaluating individual performance to determine the applicable multiplier, the Compensation Committee considers (i) the requirements of the NEO&#8217;s position, including the achievement of the corporate or divisional goals, (ii) fiscal responsibility as determined by the Compensation Committee with input from our CEO, (iii) the NEO&#8217;s senior leadership ability and contribution to Broadcom&#8217;s culture, and (iv) how each of these factors impact the overall performance of Broadcom or the NEO&#8217;s division, as applicable. Based on each NEO&#8217;s contribution to Broadcom&#8217;s performance and their respective division&#8217;s levels of performance, the Compensation Committee or, in the case of our CEO, the independent directors, assigns each NEO an individual performance multiplier of between 50% and 150%. NEOs who consistently meet or exceed the requirements of their position, as determined by the Compensation Committee, receive an individual performance multiplier between 100% and 150%. NEOs who meet some, but not all, of the requirements of their position or for whom the Compensation Committee believes that improvement is needed receive an individual performance multiplier between 50% and 100%. Fiscal Year 2021 APB Plan Attainment In December 2021, the Compensation Committee and the independent directors reviewed Broadcom&#8217;s actual performance for Fiscal Year 2021 to determine the level of achievement for the corporate performance goals and the divisional goals, and to assign an individual performance multiplier for each of our executives. Corporate Performance Component For Fiscal Year 2021, we achieved revenue of $27,450&#160;million and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 60.7%, both of which were above the pre-established maximum attainment levels of performance. See Appendix A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

In December 2021, the Compensation Committee determined that the NEO&#8217;s divisional goals had been achieved at the levels set forth in the table below under &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 APB Plan Attainment and Payout Amounts .&#8221; Individual Performance Multiplier Due to the strong leadership and significant efforts of our NEOs in addressing the continued disruption in our normal business activities due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain constraints and macroeconomic uncertainties, we achieved a 15% increase in our revenue year-over-year and increased our non-GAAP operating margin. The Compensation Committee, with input from our CEO, determined that each of our NEOs (other than our CEO) should receive an individual performance multiplier between 100 to 150%, with higher multipliers attributable to the NEOs&#8217; leadership and efforts in growing our business and exceeding division targets while navigating the continued disruption in our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain constraints and macroeconomic uncertainties. The independent directors, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, determined that Mr.&#160;Tan should receive an individual performance multiplier of 150%. Mr. Tan successfully led and navigated Broadcom through many challenges in fiscal year 2021, including managing our business and workforce during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and addressing supply chain constraints and customer demands, and delivered strong financial and operational growth, resulting in a payout of 225% of his target bonus.

(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prior to her promotion to CFO, target bonus was 50%, which resulted in a pro-rated bonus target percent of 95% for Fiscal Year 2021. (3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents direct expenses of the division, as applicable. Discretionary Cash Bonuses Each year, the Compensation Committee may supplement or substitute the APB Plan payout earned by our NEOs with discretionary cash bonuses that are awarded based on our CEO&#8217;s recommendations (other than with respect to himself) and the Compensation Committee&#8217;s assessment of individual contributions. Discretionary cash bonuses were not awarded to our NEOs for Fiscal Year 2021. 36&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Long-Term Incentive Compensation Our equity awards serve as a long-term retention tool for our executives and are intended to reflect the value we place on their contribution to Broadcom. The philosophy behind our equity awards is to provide each executive with a strong incentive to remain with and build value in Broadcom over an extended period of time. The Compensation Committee believes that an annual grant of PSU awards for our CEO and a combination of service-based RSU awards and PSU awards for our other executives further the objectives of our philosophy. Because the value of the service-based RSU awards fluctuates based on our stock price and the PSU awards motivate strategic financial performance improvement and maximize our stock price and TSR, our executives&#8217; interests are closely aligned with our stockholders&#8217; interests. The Compensation Committee has historically granted equity awards under our annual equity program to our NEOs (other than our CEO) in March of each year, with 50% in the form of service-based RSU awards and 50% in the form of PSU awards. Because our NEOs (other than our CEO) received the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards, they have not received since 2019 regular annual equity awards and will not receive regular annual equity awards until at least 2023. Accordingly, in Fiscal Year 2021, our NEOs (other than our CEO) were not granted regular annual equity awards under our annual equity program. However, our NEOs (other than our CEO) would be eligible to receive equity awards for outside the ordinary course of events related to promotions or retention. As described below , equity awards were granted to Ms. Spears, Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause in Fiscal Year 2021 in connection with their promotions, which increased their respective responsibilities. See the &#8220; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Elements of Executive Compensation &#8211; Long-Term Incentive Compensation &#8221; in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020 for a detailed discussion of the Multi-Year Equity Awards. Equity Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Equity Incentive Award Grant to Mr. Tan On December 8, 2020, the independent directors, in consultation with Compensia and upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved an annual PSU award for Mr. Tan (the &#8220;Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award&#8221;), contingent upon stockholder approval of our 2012 Plan that was obtained at the 2021 annual meeting on April 5, 2021. Mr. Tan was awarded this PSU award as part of his regular total annual direct compensation to maintain alignment of his interests with our stockholders interests and to encourage his retention, as well as to reflect the competitive talent market. Absent such award, Mr. Tan would no longer have had any unvested equity awards after June 2021. Mr. Tan may earn up to 300% of the target number of shares based on our TSR performance as compared to the S&#38;P 500 (&#8220;Relative TSR&#8221;) and our absolute TSR performance measured from November 2, 2020 to October 29, 2023 (the &#8220;Performance Period&#8221;), subject to his continued employment on the vesting date of October 29, 2023. However, as Mr. Tan has reached the age of 70, if he retires from Broadcom on or after the last day of Fiscal Year 2021, the Performance Period will end on the date of his retirement notice and vest on his retirement date. The number of shares earned will be determined by multiplying the target number of shares by the achievement factor (the &#8220;Achievement Factor&#8221;). In the event of Mr. Tan&#8217;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability prior to October 29, 2023, 100% of the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award will automatically vest with respect to the target number of shares. The table below sets forth the Relative TSR and the Achievement Factor for the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award. Relative TSR Achievement Factor (1) Below the 25 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0 At the 25 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0.25 At the 50 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 1.0 At or above the 75 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 3.0 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Relative TSR achieved during the applicable performance period is between two of the levels set forth in the table above, the Achievement Factor will be determined using linear interpolation, except if Relative TSR for the performance period is less than the 25th percentile of the S&#38;P 500, the Achievement Factor will be 0. If our absolute TSR is negative, then the maximum number of shares that may be earned is 100% of the target shares. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;37 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The award value of the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award approved by the independent directors was $25,000,000 and the number of target shares subject to the award was based on the closing stock price on December 15, 2020, the effective date of the award. However, the award value in the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table &#8221; below is $54,056,808, which reflects the accounting grant date fair value under ASC 718 on April 5, 2021, when the stockholders approved the 2012 Plan and the actual grant date for accounting purposes. Several factors generally explain the difference, including&#58; (i) Broadcom&#8217;s stock price increased from $418.06 on December 15, 2020, the effective date of the award, to $488.48 on April 5, 2021, the actual grant date&#59; and (ii) Relative TSR is a &#8220;market-based measure&#8221; that requires the target number of shares to be valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which resulted in a higher value of the shares at the then-current price based on the plan design, including the potential achievement above target under the PSU award. Promotion Equity Incentive Award Grants to Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause On December 8, 2020, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Compensia, approved promotion equity incentive awards for Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause, contingent upon stockholder approval of our 2012 Plan that was obtained at the 2021 annual meeting on April 5, 2021. Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause each received promotion equity incentive awards with a target market value of $15,000,000, consisting of 50% service-based RSU awards (the &#8220;Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion RSUs&#8221;) and 50% PSU awards at target (the &#8220;Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion PSUs&#8221; and, together with the Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion RSUs, the &#8220;Promotion Awards&#8221;), effective as of and based on the closing price of our common stock on December 15, 2020. The terms and amounts of the Promotion Awards were designed to align Dr. Kawwas&#8217; and Mr. Krause&#8217;s long term equity incentive compensation to the competitive talent market and to reflect their increased responsibilities due to their promotions. The Compensation Committee does not anticipate granting Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause regular annual equity awards under our annual equity award program until at least 2023. The Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion RSUs will vest over a three-year period, with one-third of the Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion RSUs vesting on each anniversary of December 15, 2020, subject to Dr. Kawwas&#8217; or Mr. Krause&#8217;s (as applicable) continued employment on the relevant vesting dates. Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause may earn up to 200% of the target number of shares under their respective Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion PSUs based on our Relative TSR and absolute TSR measured over the period beginning on November 2, 2020 and ending on October 29, 2023, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares earned will be determined by multiplying the target number of shares by the Achievement Factor. Subject to Dr. Kawwas&#8217; or Mr. Krause&#8217;s (as applicable) continued employment on the vesting date, the Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion PSUs will vest on October 29, 2023. The table below sets forth the Relative TSR and Achievement Factor for the Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion PSUs. Relative TSR Achievement Factor (1) Below the 25 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0 At the 25 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0.5 At the 50 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 1.0 At or above the 75 th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 2.0 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Relative TSR achieved during the applicable performance period is between two of the levels set forth in the table above, the Achievement Factor will be determined using linear interpolation, except if Relative TSR for the performance period is less than the 25th percentile of the S&#38;P 500, the Achievement Factor will be 0. If our absolute TSR is negative, then the maximum number of shares that may be earned is 100% of the target shares. The value of each of the Promotion Awards in the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table &#8221; below is $20,115,046 because it is the accounting grant date fair value under ASC 718 on April 5, 2021, when the stockholders approved the 2012 Plan and the actual grant date for accounting purposes. The same factors provided above for the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award explain the difference between the target market value approved by the Compensation Committee and the accounting grant date fair value. Promotion Equity Incentive Award Grants to Ms. Spears On December 8, 2020, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Compensia, approved promotion equity incentive awards for Ms. Spears. Ms. Spears was granted a service-based RSU award for 13,000 shares (the &#8220;Spears Promotion RSUs&#8221;) and a PSU award for 13,000 shares (the &#8220;Spears Promotion PSUs&#8221;) at target on December 15, 2020. The terms and amounts of Ms. Spears&#8217; promotion equity incentive awards were designed to align Ms. Spears long term equity incentive compensation to the competitive talent market and to reflect her increased responsibilities due to her 38&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS promotion. The Compensation Committee does not anticipate granting Ms. Spears regular annual equity awards under our annual equity award program until at least 2023. The Spears Promotion RSUs will vest over four years at a rate of 25% per year on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to Ms. Spears&#8217; continued employment on the relevant vesting date. The Spears Promotion PSUs are earned based on our Relative TSR and our absolute TSR over four overlapping performance periods that begin on March 2, 2020 and end on March 1st of 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The number of shares of common stock that may be earned is capped at 25% of the target number of shares for each of the first three performance periods. In the aggregate, Ms. Spears may earn up to 200% of the target number of shares, if at the end of the fourth performance period our Relative TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Index and our absolute TSR is not negative. No shares will be earned for a performance period if our Relative TSR is below the 25th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Index. The Spears Promotion PSUs vest on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to her continued employment on the relevant vesting date. Within 60 days after the end of each performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the number of shares by multiplying the target number of shares subject to the performance period (25% of the total target number of shares) by an Achievement Factor . The Achievement Factor is based on our Relative TSR for the performance period. For the fourth performance period the Achievement Factor is based on our Relative TSR, as well as the sum of the Achievement Factors for the first three performance periods (the &#8220;Prior Achievement Sum&#8221;). However, if our absolute TSR is negative for the fourth performance period, then the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be earned is 100% of the total target number of shares. If the Relative TSR is between two of the percentile levels, the number of shares earned will be determined using linear interpolation. The table below sets forth the Relative TSR and Achievement Factor for the Spears Promotion PSUs. Relative TSR Achievement Factor Performance Periods 1, 2 and 3 At the 50th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 1 At the 25th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0.5 Below the 25th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0 Performance Period 4 At the 75th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Absolute TSR Negative &#61; 4 less the Prior Achievement Sum Absolute TSR Neutral or Positive &#61; 8 less the Prior Achievement Sum (not to exceed, in aggregate, 200% of the target number of shares) At the 50th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 4 less the Prior Achievement Sum At the 25th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Prior Achievement Sum greater than or equal to 1.5&#61;0.5 Prior Achievement Sum less than 1.5&#61;2 less the Prior Achievement Sum Below the 25th Percentile of the S&#38;P 500 0 The table below sets forth the Relative TSR attainment and the number of shares earned by Ms. Spears under the Spears Promotion PSUs for the performance period ending March 1, 2021, as determined by the Compensation Committee, which vested on the first anniversary of the grant date on December 15, 2021.

PSU Awards Earned for the 2017-2021, 2018-2021, 2019-2021 and 2020-2021 Performance Periods The PSU award granted to our CEO in Fiscal Year 2017 consisted of an aggregate of 168,000 shares, with the opportunity to earn up to 756,000 shares based on our Relative TSR and our absolute TSR, over two overlapping performance periods, consisting of one three-year performance period that ended in Fiscal Year 2020 (&#8220;Performance Period #1&#8221;) and one four-year performance period that ended in Fiscal Year 2021 (&#8220;Performance Period #2&#8221;). Following completion of each performance period, the independent directors confirmed the Relative TSR attained for the completed performance period and the shares earned under the PSU award. The table below sets forth the Relative TSR attainment and the number of shares earned by Mr. Tan under the PSU award for Performance Period #1 and Performance Period #2, as confirmed by the independent directors.

Our ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire Broadcom common stock through periodic payroll deductions, at a 15% discount, based on a six-month &#8220;look-back&#8221; period. Our ESPP is structured in the U.S. as a qualified plan under Section&#160;423 of the Code. Our ESPP requires participants to hold their purchased shares of common stock for a minimum of six months after any purchase date, unless they cease to be eligible to participate in the ESPP in which case the shares of common stock become freely tradable, subject to applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy. Other Compensation The Compensation Committee provides modest perquisites and other personal benefits to our executives on a case-by-case basis. Typically, the Compensation Committee will provide a perquisite to an executive in limited circumstances, such as where it believes that such benefit is appropriate to assist in the performance of the executive&#8217;s duties, to make the executive more efficient and effective, and for recruitment, motivation, retention or security purposes. For example, in Fiscal Year 2021, Mr.&#160;Tan received reimbursement for travel to his residence in Pennsylvania and a car service for business-related travel in the San Francisco Bay Area, both of which were approved by the independent directors. For additional information on the perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs in Fiscal Year 2021, see the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table &#8221; below. Severance and Change in Control Benefits The Compensation Committee believes that severance and change in control arrangements are important parts of the overall compensation program for our NEOs. Severance arrangements provide a stable work environment and are used primarily to attract and retain individuals with the requisite experience and ability to drive our success. Change in control provisions help to secure the continued employment and dedication of our NEOs, to reduce any concern that they might have regarding their own continued employment prior to or following a change in control of Broadcom and to promote continuity of management during a corporate transaction. Each of our NEOs is eligible for severance and change in control payments and benefits under their respective severance benefit agreement, including vesting acceleration of the equity awards following a Covered Termination (as defined below under &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8212; Severance and Change in Control Agreements with Named Executive Officers&#59; Death and Permanent Disability Policies&#59; Retiremen t&#8221;) in connection with a change in control, which is commonly referred to as a &#8220;double trigger&#8221; provision. The Compensation Committee provides such payments and benefits to our NEOs based on its review of severance practices at the companies in our compensation peer group and as the result of arms&#8217; length negotiations at the time our NEOs enter into employment with Broadcom, when they are requested to take on additional responsibilities, or from time to time if deemed necessary or desirable to achieve parity with other NEOs or otherwise. Further, we believe our double trigger change in control arrangements protects stockholder value by allowing us the opportunity to deliver a motivated management team to any potential acquirer. If we did not offer any such change in control arrangements, our NEOs could be less motivated to pursue a potential acquisition even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders, due to the possibility that they would lose the potential value of their unvested equity compensation upon an acquisition. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these arrangements, as well as an estimate of the post-employment payments and benefits that our NEOs are eligible to receive, see &#8220; Executive Compensation &#8211; Severance and Change in Control Agreements with Named Executive Officers&#59; Death and Permanent Disability Policies&#59; Retirement &#8221; below. Fiscal Year 2022 Compensation Actions The Compensation Committee and the independent directors carefully considered the desirability of retaining and further incentivizing Mr. Tan to create additional value for our stockholders. They also considered the appropriate market value for the grant of equity awards to Mr. Tan in comparison to awards granted by our peer group companies and in connection with our corporate strategy. In light of these considerations, Mr. Tan was granted an annual PSU award that vests based on our Relative TSR and absolute TSR (the &#8220;Fiscal Year 2022 TSR PSU Award&#8221;) and PSU award that vests depending on the satisfaction of pre-approved metrics and milestones related to certain strategic objectives (the &#8220;Fiscal Year 2022 Strategic PSU Award&#8221;), as described below. 42&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS In September 2021, the independent directors approved the Fiscal Year 2022 TSR PSU Award with a target value of $26,000,000 and effective as of and based on the closing price of our common stock on November 1, 2021. The target number of shares was determined by dividing the target value by the closing price of Broadcom&#8217;s common stock on November 1, 2021 (rounded down to the nearest share). Mr. Tan may earn up to 300% of the target number of shares based on our Relative TSR and absolute TSR performance measured over the period beginning on November 1, 2021 and ending on November 3, 2024 as confirmed by the independent directors and subject to Mr. Tan&#8217;s continued employment on the vesting date, November 3, 2024. However, if Mr. Tan retires from Broadcom on or after the last day of Fiscal Year 2022, the performance period will end on the date of his retirement notice and vest on his retirement date. If Mr. Tan&#8217;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability prior to November 3, 2024, 100% of the Fiscal Year 2022 TSR PSU Award will automatically vest with respect to the target number of shares. In October 2021, the independent directors also approved the Fiscal Year 2022 Strategic PSU Award with a maximum value of $10,000,000 and effective as of and based on the closing price of our common stock on November 1, 2021. The maximum number of shares was determined by dividing the maximum value by the closing price of Broadcom&#8217;s common stock on November 1, 2021 (rounded down to the nearest share). Mr. Tan will not earn any shares unless the independent directors confirm in their sole discretion that all of the pre-approved metrics and milestones related to corporate strategy, acquisition strategy and leadership development are satisfied during the performance period from November 1, 2021 to October 30, 2022, in which case Mr. Tan will earn the maximum number of shares. Subject to Mr. Tan&#8217;s continued employment on the vesting date and achievement of the award&#8217;s performance goals, the Fiscal Year 2022 Strategic PSU Award will vest on October 30, 2022. If Mr. Tan&#8217;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability prior to October 30, 2022, 100% of the Fiscal Year 2022 Strategic PSU Award will automatically vest with respect to the maximum number of shares. In December 2021, the Compensation Committee retained Meridian, as its independent compensation consultant to assume the role previously held by Compensia. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Meridian pursuant to the six independence factors set forth in the SEC and Nasdaq rules and concluded that Meridian was independent and its work for the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflict of interest. Starting in Fiscal Year 2022, Meridian will provide consulting services to the Compensation Committee and the independent directors. The Compensation Committee has relied on Meridian to review management&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2021 annual assessment of compensation-related risks. Meridian will not provide any other services to Broadcom except advising the Compensation Committee and the independent directors on compensation-related matters.

Although the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards have four staggered vesting start dates of March 15, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, under ASC 718 we were required to include the grant date fair value of all the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards in Fiscal Year 2019. As the PSU awards are not subject to performance conditions as defined under ASC 718, the maximum grant date fair values for such awards do not differ from the values presented in this table.

The PSU award will vest at a rate of 25% per year on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to Ms. Spears&#8217; continued employment through the applicable vesting date and subject to the achievement of specified performance goals over each performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee within 60 days following the end of each performance period. The performance criteria is based on our Relative TSR over four performance periods beginning on March 2, 2020 and ending on each of March 1 of 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The number of shares that may be earned is capped at one-quarter of the target number of shares for each of the first three performance periods. In the aggregate, Ms. Spears may earn up to 200% of the target number of shares, if during the fourth performance period our Relative TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Index and our absolute TSR is not negative, provided that no shares will be earned for a performance period if our Relative TSR is below the 25th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Index. (12)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents service-based RSU awards granted under our 2012 Plan that vest at a rate of one-third per year on each anniversary of December 15, 2020, subject to the NEO&#8217;s continued employment through the applicable vesting dates. (13)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Represents PSU awards granted under our 2012 Plan based on attainment of the maximum performance level, given that the level of performance through October 31, 2021 is tracking above target. This PSU is earned based on our Relative TSR and absolute TSR measured over the period beginning on November 2, 2020 and ending on October 29, 2023, as determined by the Compensation Committee, subject to the NEO&#8217;s continued employment on the vesting date of October 29, 2023. In the aggregate, the NEO may earn up to 200% of the target number of shares if our Relative TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Index and our absolute TSR is not negative, provided that no shares will be earned if our Relative TSR is below the 25th percentile of the S&#38;P 500 Index. 48&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Fiscal Year 2021 Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table The following table sets forth information regarding the exercise of stock options and the vesting of service-based RSU awards during Fiscal Year 2021 for each of our NEOs. Stock option award value realized is calculated by multiplying the number of stock options exercised by the aggregate sale price, less the aggregate exercise price of the exercised stock options. RSU award value realized is calculated by multiplying the number of shares of common stock shown in the table by the closing market price of our shares of common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, on the date the service-based RSU awards vested. Value Realized on Exercise and Value Realized on Vesting represent long-term gain over multiple years of service by the NEO and are not considered as part of a NEO&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2021 compensation.

Severance and Change in Control Agreements with Named Executive Officers&#59; Death and Permanent Disability Policies&#59; Retirement Severance Benefit Agreements &#8212; General Terms In Fiscal Year 2021 each of our NEOs was party to a severance benefits agreement with Broadcom (as may be amended or restated from time to time, a &#8220;severance benefit agreement&#8221;). In December 2020, we amended and restated the severance benefit agreements with each of Messrs. Tan and Krause and Dr. Kawwas. These severance benefits agreements provide each NEO with severance payments and other benefits in the event termination of employment is without cause, due to death or permanent disability or for &#8220;good reason,&#8221; as such terms are defined in the severance benefits agreements (a &#8220;Covered Termination&#8221;), provided that the NEO timely executes a general release of claims in Broadcom&#8217;s favor. If a Covered Termination takes place within 12 months following (or in the case of Mr. Tan, within three months prior to or 12 months following) a &#8220;change in control&#8221; (as defined in the severance benefits agreement) of Broadcom, Broadcom must provide the NEO with&#58; Name Continued &#160;Base&#160;Salary&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Bonus (1) &#160;&#160;&#160; Health Benefits Continuation Coverage Equity Award Vesting Acceleration (2) Hock E.

(2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The NEO will receive full acceleration of all outstanding service-based RSU awards and acceleration of outstanding PSU awards, after giving effect to any deemed satisfaction of performance goals in accordance with this footnote (2). Effective Fiscal Year 2021, for Messrs. Tan and Krause, Ms. Spears and Dr. Kawwas, except as otherwise provided in an applicable award agreement, for PSU awards for which the performance period has not been completed, the performance goals will be deemed met at target levels. For Mr. Brazeal, the performance goals applicable to his PSU awards will be deemed satisfied up to 100% in the discretion of our Board, based on Broadcom&#8217;s performance through the date of the change in control. The severance benefit agreements for Messrs. Tan, Brazeal, Krause and Dr. Kawwas also contain alternative language that would apply to PSU awards that vest based on share price contingencies, but no such awards were outstanding as of October 31, 2021. Under the terms of the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award, the Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion PSUs and the Spears Promotion PSUs, the performance goals will be based on Broadcom&#8217;s performance through a date within 10 days prior to the change in control and the Achievement Factor will be calculated on a date before the change in control, as determined by the plan administrator of the 2012 Plan.

(2) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If termination of employment without &#8220;cause&#8221; or for &#8220;good reason&#8221; occurs during the Continuation Period (as defined below), the NEO will receive a lump sum cash amount shortly after their release of claims becomes effective and irrevocable equal to&#58; (x) that number of shares that would have vested under the Kawwas&#47;Krause Promotion RSUs and PSUs had the NEO remained continuously employed by Broadcom for an additional 18 months following his termination, with the performance goals deemed met at target performance, multiplied by (y) the closing price of Broadcom common stock on the date his employment terminates (or, if there is no closing price on such date, then the closing price on the last preceding trading date). The definition of &#8220;good reason&#8221; generally means any of the following, subject to certain notice and cure period provisions&#58; (A)&#160;a material reduction in the NEO&#8217;s salary (other than as part of a broad salary reduction program instituted because Broadcom is in financial distress)&#59; (B)&#160;a substantial reduction in the NEO&#8217;s duties and responsibilities&#59; (C)&#160;the elimination or reduction of the NEO&#8217;s eligibility to participate in Broadcom&#8217;s benefit programs that is inconsistent with the eligibility of our executives to participate therein&#59; (D)&#160;Broadcom informs the NEO of its intention to transfer the NEO&#8217;s primary workplace to a location that is more than 50 miles from the location of the NEO&#8217;s primary workplace as of such date&#59; (E)&#160;Broadcom&#8217;s material breach of the severance benefits agreement that is not cured within 60&#160;days written notice thereof&#59; and (F)&#160;any serious chronic mental or physical illness of the NEO or a member of the NEO&#8217;s family that requires the NEO to terminate their employment because of substantial interference with the NEOs duties&#59; provided, that at Broadcom&#8217;s request the NEO provides Broadcom with a written physician&#8217;s statement confirming the existence of such mental or physical illness. For each of Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause, a termination during the period between and inclusive of December 10, 2020 and December 15, 2023 (such period, the &#8220;Continuation Period&#8221;) for &#8220;good reason&#8221; also includes&#58; (A) an adverse change or reduction in either (i) their position, title, reporting responsibilities or duties or (ii) compensation, or (B) being required to report to anyone other than our CEO or the Board. Acceleration of Equity Awards in the Event of Death or Permanent Disability Upon an executive&#8217;s death or permanent disability, Broadcom&#8217;s Death and Permanent Disability Policies, updated in June 2021, provide for the full acceleration of vesting of the executive&#8217;s outstanding and unvested equity awards that have started vesting and would otherwise vest solely based on the executive&#8217;s continued service, including PSU awards for which the performance criteria have been met as of the date of such death or permanent disability. Under such circumstances, any PSU awards held by executives with performance periods that have started but not ended will have their performance goals deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, with all other terms and conditions deemed met. However, pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards, holders are not entitled to full acceleration of vesting of these awards except with respect to those awards for which the vesting start date has already occurred at the time of the applicable executive&#8217;s death or disability. The Death Policy applies to all of our employees, directors and other service providers, including the NEOs, while the Permanent Disability Policy applies to (i)&#160;any officer of Broadcom, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1 and (ii)&#160;any member of the CEO&#8217;s executive staff, including the NEOs, as determined by the CEO. The benefits provided under the Death and Permanent Disability Policies are intended to be additive to any benefits a NEO becomes entitled to under any other policy, program, plan or agreement (including severance benefit agreements), generally unless the Board, the Compensation Committee or the Policy Committee (as defined in the applicable policy) determines otherwise. Retirement As Mr. Tan has reached the age of 70, if he retires from Broadcom on or after the last day of Fiscal Year 2021, the performance period for the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award will end on the date of his retirement notice and vest on his retirement date, subject to achievement of the performance goals. Such retirement notice must be provided at least 30 days prior to Mr. Tan&#8217;s retirement date for the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award to vest in accordance with this paragraph. If Mr. Tan had provided retirement notice on October 1, 2021 and retired effective October 31, 2021, 98,227 shares 50&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION subject to the Tan Fiscal Year 2021 PSU Award would have vested and the value of such acceleration would have been $52,224,349, based on a per share price of $531.67, which was the closing price per share of Broadcom common stock on October 29, 2021. Potential Payments and Benefits upon Certain Terminations of Employment in Connection with a Change in Control The following table reflects the potential payments and benefits to which our NEOs would be entitled under their severance benefits agreements and equity award agreements in effect as of the end of Fiscal Year 2021 in the event of a Covered Termination taking place within 12 months following a change in control of Broadcom (or in the case of Mr.&#160;Tan three months before or 12 months following a change in control of Broadcom). The amounts presented in the table assume an employment termination date and a change in control date of October&#160;31, 2021 and that all eligibility requirements contemplated by the NEO&#8217;s respective agreements and our policies and practices, as applicable, were met.

For Fiscal Year 2021, the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table ,&#8221; is $60,703,627 and the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees is $247,541. The Ratio is 245 to 1. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee&#8217;s compensation in accordance with SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine the total compensation for purposes of the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table &#8221; with respect to each of our NEOs. In Fiscal Year 2021, Mr.&#160;Tan was granted a PSU award to continue to align Mr. Tan&#8217;s interests with the interests of our stockholders and to encourage his retention. As of October 31, 2021, Mr. Tan had no other unvested and outstanding equity awards. Our median compensated employee was granted 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards, which will vest on the same basis as four annual equity grants made on March 15 of each year, beginning in 2019. In order to better compare Mr. Tan&#8217;s annual total compensation to our median compensated employee, we are providing a supplemental pay ratio that includes (1) in the CEO&#8217;s 2021 annual total compensation, the intended $25 million target value of Mr. Tan&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2021 PSU award, taking the target number of shares multiplied by the closing stock price on the effective date of December 15, 2020 (in lieu of the grant date fair value reflected in the &#8220; Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Compensation Table &#8221;), and (2) in the median employee&#8217;s 2021 annual total compensation the grant date fair value of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Award with a vesting start date of March 15, 2021 and excluding the grant date fair value of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards with vesting start dates in 2019, 2020 and 2022. This results in notional, total compensation for Fiscal Year 2021 of $31,646,807 for our CEO and $283,449 for our median employee. The supplemental ratio using this amount is 112 to 1. As permitted by SEC rules, for purposes of calculating the pay ratio set forth above, we used the same median employee that we identified for purposes of our pay ratio disclosure last year, based on our determination that there was no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio. Our median employee also remained in the same role in Fiscal Year 2020 and Fiscal Year 2021. To identify the median employee, we used the following methodology in Fiscal Year 2020&#58; &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We collected compensation data from our human resources system of record for all employees globally, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis, as of November&#160;1, 2020, which was the last day of Fiscal Year 2020. Last year, our measuring date was also the last day of our fiscal year. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We annualized the compensation of all permanent full-time and part-time employees who we hired between November 4, 2019 and November&#160;1, 2020. We applied an exchange rate used in our human resources system of record as of November&#160;1, 2020 to convert all international currencies into U.S. dollars. &#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We used target total direct compensation as of November&#160;1, 2020, as our consistently applied compensation measure. In this context, target total direct compensation meant (1) the applicable annual base salary level in effect as of November&#160;1, 2020, (2) the annual incentive cash target amount or commission target amount payable for service in Fiscal Year 2020, and (3) the approved value of the annual equity awards granted during Fiscal Year 2020. The Ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system of record. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, this pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. Broadcom Inc. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;53 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION Plans Approved by our Stockholders Broadcom has three equity compensation plans that have been approved by our stockholders&#58; the Avago Plan, the 2012 Plan and the ESPP. The Avago Plan expired in July 2019 and no new grants may be made under the Avago Plan following such date. Neither the 2012 Plan nor the ESPP have an expiration date. Plans Not Approved by our Stockholders Broadcom assumed outstanding equity awards granted under the LSI Plan, the 2012 Plan, the Brocade 2009 Stock Plan, the Brocade Amended and Restated Inducement Award Plan, the CA, Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan and under other equity compensation plans or agreements that were assumed by Broadcom in connection with our acquisitions of LSI, Broadcom Corporation, Brocade Communications Systems, and CA, and other companies that originally granted those awards. The following table sets forth as of October&#160;31, 2021 the number and weighted-average exercise price of shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, service-based RSU awards and PSU awards, and the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under all of our equity compensation plans.

By Order of the Board, &#160; Hock E. Tan Director, President and Chief Executive Officer February&#160;18, 2022 San&#160;Jose, California 62&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2022 Proxy Statement APPENDIX A Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Fiscal Year Ended October 31, &#160;2021 November 1, &#160;2020 November&#160;3, 2019 (in millions) Operating income on GAAP basis $ 8,519 $ 4,014 $ 3,444 Purchase accounting effect on inventory &#8212; 11 &#8212; Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 5,403 6,220 5,212 Stock-based compensation expense 1,704 1,976 2,185 Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges 165 233 813 Litigation settlements 1 63 &#8212; Acquisition-related costs 120 422 275 Operating income on non-GAAP basis $ 15,912 $ 12,939 $ 11,929 Operating income on non-GAAP basis $ 15,912 $ 12,939 Provisions or accruals for anticipated payouts under APB Plan 764 549 Adjusted Operating income on non-GAAP basis $ 16,676 $ 13,488 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,761 $ 12,061 $ 9,697 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (440) (463) (432) Free cash flow $ 13,321 $ 11,598 $ 9,265 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment, gains (losses) on investments, income (loss) from distinguished operations, non-GAAP tax reconciliation, and other adjustments. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our on-going performance. Therefore, we provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of our on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of our underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating our core operating performance, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to our operations, and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from our GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. The forgoing reconciliation includes a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, &#8220;Net cash provided by operating activities.&#8221; Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Our free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.
