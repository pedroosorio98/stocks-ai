(&#8220;Nu Holdings&#8221;, &quot;Nu&quot; or &#8220;Company&#8221;) hereby informs its shareholders and the market that, on this day, the Brazilian Central Bank granted Nu Pagamentos S.A. &#8211; Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamento (&quot;Nu Pagamentos&quot;) approval for the implementation of the Alternative Standardized Approach (&quot;ASA&quot;) methodology. Effective today, the ASA methodology will supersede the Basic Indicator Approach (&quot;BIA&quot;) methodology in calculating the portion of risk-weighted assets associated with determining the operational risk capital requirement for the prudential conglomerate of Nu Pagamentos in Brazil (&quot;Nu Brazil&quot;). &nbsp; It is anticipated that this transition will yield a reduction in operational risk capital requirements for Nu Brazil. Illustratively, had the ASA methodology been in place at the end of September 2023, the required capital of Nu Brazil would have been reduced by USD 152 million and its capital adequacy ratio (&quot;CAR&quot;) would have been 12.5%. Please note that the above-mentioned capital adequacy ratio does not consider the excess capital held by Nu Holdings, which, as of September 30, 2023, amounted to USD 2.3 billion. &nbsp; For further information or inquiries, please contact our Investor Relations department. &nbsp; &nbsp; Investor Relations J&ouml;rg Friedemann investors@nubank.com.br Media Relations Rafael Corr&ecirc;a press@nubank.com.br &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By:&nbsp; /s/ Jorg Friedemann &nbsp; &nbsp; Jorg Friedemann Investor Relations Officer &nbsp; Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;December 29, 2023 &nbsp;
