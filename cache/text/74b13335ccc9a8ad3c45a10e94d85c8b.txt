Private Equity reported net income of $7 million, compared with net income of $212 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $36 million, compared with $410 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower net valuation gains on privately held investments. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million, compared with a net loss of $429 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $87 million, compared with a loss of $648 million in the prior year. Current-quarter net interest income was a loss of $10 million, compared with a loss of $558 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefit of higher interest rates and reinvestment opportunities. Other Corporate reported net income of $408 million, compared with a net loss of $335 million in the prior year. The current quarter included $227 million of legal expense compared with approximately $600 million of legal expense in the prior year.

See notes on page 12 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $24.5 billion, $23.0 billion, and $25.2 billion for the second quarter of 2014, first quarter of 2014, and second quarter of 2013, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.0 billion, down $511 million from the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $25.3 billion, down $609 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.3 billion, down $782 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $11.0 billion, up $173 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of higher investment JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 11 securities yields, lower long-term debt and deposit yields, and higher loan balances, largely offset by lower loan yields and lower trading balances. The provision for credit losses was $692 million, compared with $47 million from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $848 million, compared with a benefit of $29 million in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer provision reflected a $354 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $1.5 billion reduction in the prior year. The current-quarter consumer allowance release primarily reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, compared with $1.5 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.34% and 1.66%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $156 million, compared with an expense of $76 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $44 million, compared with net recoveries of $67 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rate of 0.06% and 0.09%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.69%, compared with 2.06% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.0 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $9.5 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $435 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower expense in mortgage production and servicing and lower performance-related compensation in the Corporate & Investment Bank, predominantly offset by higher cost of controls. The current quarter noninterest expense included $669 million of legal expense, compared with $678 million of legal expense in the prior year. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio1 was 9.8%. Headcount was 245,192, a decrease of 8,871, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) and return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of TCE. TCE and ROTCE are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, as well as facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors. d. Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital and the CET1 ratio under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and the U.S. proposed supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 161-165 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and on pages 63-68 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. e. The CIB provides non-GAAP financial measures, as such measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. • The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the impact of consolidated Firm- administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. • Prior to January 1, 2014, the CIB provided non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on net revenue and net income. Beginning in the first quarter 2014, the Firm does not exclude FVA and DVA from its assessment of business performance; however, the Firm continues to present these non-GAAP measures for the periods prior to January 1, 2014, as they reflected how management assessed the underlying business performance of the CIB in those prior periods. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Core loans include loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. b. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. c. Consumer & Community Banking allocated equity includes $3.0 billion of capital held at the Consumer & Community Banking level related to legacy mortgage servicing matters. d. The credit and debit volume metric is based on Nilson data as of 2013. e. Consumer & Business Banking deposit rankings are based on the Firm's and peer disclosures as of the first quarter of 2014. f. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios, in production expense in Mortgage Production, and in core servicing expense in Mortgage Servicing. g. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the first quarter of 2014. h. Global Visa ranking based on consumer and business credit card sales volume is based on Visa data as of 1Q14. i. The eCommerce volume metric for the top 500 internet merchants is based on the 2013 Internet Retailer Top 500 Guide. j. Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of Asset Management against the performance of its peers. k. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.

For further discussion of Tier 1 common capital, see page 35 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (f) The increase in average VaR during the three months ended June 30, 2014 was due to a change in the MSR hedge position in Mortgage Banking in advance of an anticipated update to certain MSR model assumptions. When such updates were implemented, VaR decreased to prior levels. The MSR model and assumptions are continuously evaluated and periodically updated to reflect recent market behavior. Mortgage Banking average VaR was $20 million, $5 million and $15 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2013, respectively, and $13 million and $17 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, respectively.
