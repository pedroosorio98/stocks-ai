In the CIB, revenue rose 10%. Markets continued to benefit from demand for financing and robust client activity, pushing revenue up 17%. Additionally, Payments revenue reached a record $5.1 billion due to ongoing deposit and fee growth. In CCB, revenue rose 6%, and the franchise continued to acquire new customers at a robust pace. This year, we opened 1.7 million net new checking accounts and 10.4 million new credit card accounts, and we also grew wealth management households to over 3 million. Looking ahead, we are excited to become the new issuer of the Apple Card. Finally, in AWM, revenue rose 13% in the quarter to a record $6.5 billion. More impressively, client asset net inflows totaled $553 billion for the year, helping drive client assets to over $7 trillion.” Dimon continued: “These results were the product of strong execution, years of investment, a favorable market backdrop and selective deployment of excess capital. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing our capital to drive future growth, and the Apple Card is one example of patient and thoughtful deployment of our excess capital into attractive opportunities.” Dimon added: “The U.S. economy has remained resilient. While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy. These conditions could persist for some time, particularly with ongoing fiscal stimulus, the benefits of deregulation and the Fed’s recent monetary policy. However, as usual, we remain vigilant, and markets seem to underappreciate the potential hazards—including from complex geopolitical conditions, the risk of sticky inflation and elevated asset prices.” Dimon concluded: “I want to reiterate how proud I am of our employees across the globe and how they work to support our customers and communities every single day.” SIGNIFICANT ITEM IN 4Q25 RESULTS n $2.2 billion credit reserve established for the forward purchase commitment of the Apple credit card portfolio ($0.60 decrease in EPS10) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $4.1 billion or $1.50 per share n $7.9 billion of common stock net repurchases11 n Net payout LTM11,12 of 82% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $126.99, up 9% YoY; tangible book value per share2 of $107.56, up 11% YoY n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $288 billion, Standardized ratio3 of 14.5% and Advanced ratio3 of 14.1% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.8% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n Approximately $3.3 trillion of credit and capital13 raised in 2025: n $280 billion of credit for consumers n $33 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $2.9 trillion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $76 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017-2070 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons are for the fourth quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net interest income excluding Markets 2 was $23.9 billion, up 4%, reflecting the impact of higher deposit balances, as well as higher revolving balances in Card Services, largely offset by the impact of lower rates. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets 2 was $14.7 billion, up 7%, driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher auto operating lease income and higher Payments fees, partially offset by lower card income. Markets revenue was $8.2 billion, up 17%. Noninterest expense was $24.0 billion, up 5%, driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in front office employees, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, higher brokerage expense and distribution fees and higher occupancy expense, partially offset by an FDIC special assessment accrual release. The provision for credit losses was $ 4.7 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.5 billion, up $150 million, predominantly driven by Wholesale. The net reserve build was $2.1 billion, reflecting a $2.2 billion reserve established for the forward purchase commitment of the Apple credit card portfolio. In the prior year, the provision was $2.6 billion, net charge-offs were $2.4 billion and the net reserve build was $267 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue14 was $19.4 billion, up 6%. Banking & Wealth Management net revenue was $10.9 billion, up 7%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income on higher deposit margin, as well as higher asset management fees in J.P. Morgan Wealth Management and higher deposit-related fees. Home Lending net revenue was $1.2 billion, down 4%, predominantly driven by lower net interest income and lower servicing revenue. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $7.3 billion, up 5%, driven by higher Card Services net interest income on higher revolving balances, as well as higher auto operating lease income, largely offset by lower card income on lower net interchange and higher new account origination costs. Noninterest expense was $10.3 billion, up 5%, driven by higher auto lease depreciation, higher marketing expense and higher compensation for bankers and advisors. The provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion. The net reserve build was $2.2 billion, driven by a $2.2 billion reserve established for the forward purchase commitment of the Apple credit card portfolio. Excluding the forward purchase commitment, reserves were flat as the effects of updates to certain macroeconomic variables were primarily offset by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $2.0 billion, relatively flat. In the prior year, the provision was $2.6 billion, net charge-offs were $2.1 billion and the net reserve build was $557 million.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year- to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $126.99, $124.96 and $ 116.07 at December 31, 2025 , September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K. d. Fourth-quarter 2025 net income and earnings per share excluding the $2.2 billion credit reserve established for the forward purchase commitment of the Apple credit card portfolio are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding this item resulted in an increase of $1.7 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $13.0 billion to $14.7 billion and an increase of $0.60 per share to reported EPS from $4.63 to $5.23. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated. The credit reserve and risk-weighted assets associated with the f orward purchase commitment of the Apple credit card portfolio resulted in a decrease to the fourth-quarter 2025 CET1 capital ratio of approximately 25 basis points under the Standardized approach and approximately 90 basis points under the Advanced approach. As of January 1, 2025, the benefit from the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) capital transition provision had been fully phased-out.

Cash and marketable securities include end-of-period eligible high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”), excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR.

Earnings per share (“EPS”). 11. Includes the net impact of employee issuances. Excludes excise tax and commissions. 12. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 13.

Credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities includes Individuals and Individual Entities primarily consisting of Global Private Bank clients within AWM. 14. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm made a change to its funds transfer pricing with respect to consumer deposits, resulting in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB net interest income which is fully offset within Corporate net interest income. Refer to page 20 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025 and page 71 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information.
