Markets were somewhat quieter, and we saw the impact reflected in the results of our trading and Asset Management businesses.” Dimon added: “Looking at performance for the full year, 2015 was another record year for the Firm for net income and EPS, and importantly we exceeded on all of our commitments – balance sheet optimization, capital, GSIB and expense. On operating leverage, we delivered core efficiencies while continuing to invest in innovation and technology, infrastructure and talent – crucial for protecting the company and customers, and for our growth.” Dimon concluded: “The Firm is getting safer and stronger each year. We are continuing to adjust our strategy to the new world and to meeting all requirements. We see exciting opportunities to invest for the future, to continue to deliver better and faster for our clients and customers.” CAPITAL RETURN $2.6 billion returned to shareholders3 in the fourth quarter $1.0 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.44 per share $11.0 billion returned to shareholders3 in 2015 $4.5 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $1.72 per share SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $2.0 trillion of credit and capital10 raised in 2015 $233 billion of credit for consumers $22 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $705 billion of credit for corporations $1.0 trillion of capital raised for clients $68 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities Investor Contact: Sarah Youngwood (212) 270-7325 Media Contact: Joe Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 1For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10%. Net revenue was $23.7 billion, up 1%, driven by higher revenue in Corporate and Consumer & Community Banking, largely offset by lower revenue in Corporate & Investment Banking and Asset Management. Noninterest expense was $14.3 billion, down 7%, driven by lower Corporate & Investment Banking expense, reflecting lower legal expense and lower compensation, as well as Consumer & Community Banking efficiencies. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, up 49%, due to reserve increases in the current quarter versus reserve releases in the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The reserve increases in the current quarter reflected an increase in wholesale reserves of $185 million, driven by downgrades, including $124 million in the Oil & Gas portfolio and $35 million in Metals/Mining.

Net revenue was $11.2 billion, an increase of 2%, driven by higher revenue in Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, partially offset by lower Mortgage Banking revenue. Noninterest expense was $6.3 billion, a decrease of 2%, driven by lower expense in Mortgage Banking and Consumer & Business Banking, partially offset by higher expense in Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto. The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by the absence of a reduction in the allowance for loan losses in Mortgage Banking and Card, largely offset by lower net charge-offs across businesses. Consumer & Business Banking net income was $968 million, an increase of 12%. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, an increase of 1%. Net interest income was $2.6 billion, down 5%, due to spread compression, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.0 billion, including an $85 million gain on the sale of a 2 $ 972 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release branch. Excluding this gain, noninterest revenue would have been up 4%, driven by higher deposit-related fees and higher debit card revenue. Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, a decrease of 3%, driven by branch efficiencies. Mortgage Banking net income was $266 million, a decrease of 21%. Net revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 10%. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, up 11%, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $533 million, down 37%, due to lower repurchase benefit and lower net servicing revenue. Net revenue increased 8% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher MSR risk management and loan growth, partially offset by lower repurchase benefit. Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, a decrease of 10%, reflecting continuing mortgage efficiencies. The provision for credit losses was $59 million, compared with $13 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the absence of a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely offset by lower net charge-offs. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto 11 net income was $1.2 billion, an increase of 20%. Net revenue was $5.0 billion, an increase of 10%. Net interest income was $3.4 billion, an increase of 2%, driven by higher loan balances and improvement in credit quality, partially offset by spread compression. Noninterest revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 33%, driven by a loss in the prior year of over $200 million related to non-core portfolio exits and a gain this quarter of approximately $160 million on the initial public offering of Square. Adjusted for these two items, noninterest revenue would have been flat, reflecting higher auto lease and Card sales volumes, offset by the impact of changes to certain co-brand partnerships. Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, up 4%, driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing expense, partially offset by lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $903 million, an increase of 6%, driven by the absence of a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely offset by lower net charge-offs.

Net revenue was $7.1 billion, a decrease of 4%. Banking revenue 12 was $2.8 billion, down 6%. Investment Banking revenue was $1.5 billion, down 11%, on lower debt underwriting fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. The business continued to rank #1 in Global Investment Banking fees in 2015. Treasury Services revenue13 was $901 million, down 4%, reflecting lower net interest income. Markets & Investor Services revenue12 was $4.3 billion, down 3%. Excluding the revenue decline related to business simplification, both total Markets and Fixed Income Markets revenue would have been down 1%, while Equity Markets revenue would have been flat. Fixed Income Markets revenue reflected continued weakness in Credit, lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets and lower Commodities revenue, largely offset by strength in the Rates business. The decline also reflected higher interest costs on higher long-term debt. Equity Markets reflected strong results in EMEA 14 derivatives and cash equities, offset by weaker derivative results in the Americas and Asia. Securities Services revenue was $933 million, reflecting the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset based fees. Noninterest expense was $4.4 billion, down 20%, primarily driven by lower legal and compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was $81 million, compared to a benefit of $59 million in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting $76 million in higher reserves driven by $63 million in the Oil & Gas portfolio. 3 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Noninterest expense was $750 million, including a $50 million impairment on leased corporate aircraft. Excluding the impairment, noninterest expense would have been up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher investment in controls. The provision for credit losses was $117 million, compared to a benefit of $48 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting $101 million in higher reserves, including $60 million in the Oil & Gas portfolio and $26 million in Metals/Mining.

Assets under management were $1.7 trillion, down 1% compared to the prior year quarter, due to the effect of lower market levels, partially offset by net inflows to long-term products. Additionally, despite continued strength in investment performance, the business had long-term net outflows of $9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Net revenue was $651 million, compared with $247 million in the prior year quarter.

Noninterest expense was $609 million, an increase of 40%, driven by higher legal expense. In the prior year fourth quarter, Private Equity results included net gains related to the sale of a portion of its portfolio, and a related goodwill impairment, resulting in an after-tax impact of approximately $150 million 16. The current quarter included tax benefits of approximately $200 million, compared with tax benefits of approximately $500 million in the prior year quarter. 5 JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a) In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b) Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c) Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures, and exclude Firmwide legal expense ($644 million and $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, respectively). Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of this item on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. d) Estimated as of 4Q15. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital rules to which the Firm will be subject to as of January 1, 2019, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For further discussion of these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 146-153 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and pages 69-73 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. e) The CIB provides the change in Total Markets, Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets revenue excluding revenue related to business simplification, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the underlying performance of the business. 6 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
