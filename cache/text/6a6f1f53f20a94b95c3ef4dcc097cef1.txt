Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 44-50 for additional information. (c) NII and NIR refer to net interest income and noninterest revenue, respectively. (d) Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis, as revenues in NII generally have offsets across other revenue lines, primarily Principal transactions revenue. Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the third quarter of 2025 versus the third quarter of 2024, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview For the third quarter of 2025, JPMorganChase reported net income of $14.4 billion, up 12%, with earnings per share of $5.07, ROE of 17% and ROTCE of 20%. • Total net revenue was $46.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting: – Net interest income ("NII") was $24.0 billion, up 2%, driven by higher revolving balances in Card Services, higher Markets net interest income, and higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression. NII excluding Markets was $23.4 billion, flat when compared with the prior year. – Noninterest revenue ("NIR") was $22.5 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by higher Markets noninterest revenue, and increases in asset management fees in AWM and CCB, investment banking fees, auto operating lease income and Payments fees. • Noninterest expense was $24.3 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in the number of employees, as well as higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, higher auto lease depreciation, and continued investments in marketing, partially offset by lower legal expense. 5 • The provision for credit losses was $3.4 billion. Net charge-offs of $2.6 billion were up $506 million, predominantly driven by Wholesale and Card Services. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses was $810 million and included $608 million in consumer and $205 million in wholesale. In the prior year, the provision was $3.1 billion, net charge-offs were $2.1 billion and the net addition to the allowance for credit losses was $1.0 billion. • The total allowance for credit losses was $29.1 billion at September 30, 2025. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.88%, compared with 1.86% in the prior year. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9-14 and pages 15-16, respectively, for a further discussion of the Firm's results, including the provision for credit losses. Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a further discussion of each of these measures. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.6 billion at September 30, 2025, up 23%, driven by: – higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, reflecting downgrades in certain industries, and – higher consumer nonaccrual loans, predominantly due to the impact of the wildfires in California in January 2025, as well as higher loans at fair value in CIB. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 66-74 and pages 61-65, respectively, for additional information. • Firmwide average loans of $1.4 trillion were up 7%, predominantly driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM. • Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 6%, reflecting: – net inflows related to client-driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, – growth in both new accounts and balances in existing accounts in AWM, and – new accounts in CCB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58 for additional information. Selected capital and other metrics • CET1 capital was $287 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 14.8% and 14.9%, respectively. • SLR was 5.8%. • TBVPS grew 10%, ending the third quarter of 2025 at $105.70. • As of September 30, 2025, the Firm had eligible end- of-period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $956 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $554 billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of liquidity sources.

This target reflects an increase of up to $500 billion over the amount that the Firm may have otherwise facilitated or financed over the next decade in support of clients in these industries. As part of this new initiative, the Firm intends to make equity investments of up to $10 billion to help a selection of companies primarily in the United States enhance their growth, spur innovation, and accelerate strategic manufacturing among other areas. • On August 25, 2025, the Firm opened its new global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York. The Firm’s principal executive offices will continue to be located at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York until senior management moves into the new building, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2025. Outlook These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward- looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorganChase’s management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 91 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 10–37 of the 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorganChase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2025 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. JPMorganChase’s current outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. Fourth quarter 2025 • Management expects net interest income to be approximately $25 billion and net interest income excluding Markets to be approximately $23.5 billion, market dependent. • Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $24.5 billion, market dependent. Full year 2025 • Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be approximately 3.3%. Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information. (b) Included the net gain related to Visa shares of $7.9 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. Quarterly results Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher equity underwriting fees predominantly due to higher revenue from IPOs and private placements, • higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by higher deal flow activity, including refinancings, and • higher advisory fees benefiting from the closing of a higher number of large transactions. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 27-34 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher Fixed Income Markets revenue primarily driven by higher revenue in Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products, and • higher Equity Markets revenue, particularly in Prime Finance. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 27-34 and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting: • in CIB, a reduction in client credits applied to deposit-related fees, as well as higher cash management fees in Payments as a result of higher volume, and • in CCB, higher deposit-related fees as a result of new accounts and higher transaction volume. Refer to CCB and CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and pages 27-34, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees increased driven by net inflows in AWM and, to a lesser extent, in CCB, and higher average market levels in AWM and CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 22-26 and pages 35-39, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees increased predominantly in CIB and AWM, largely due to higher brokerage commissions and fees on higher volume and, to a lesser extent, higher custody fees as a result of higher client activity and market levels. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 27-34 and pages 35-39, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. 9 Investment securities increased, reflecting a net gain as compared with a net loss in the prior year that was associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. The net gain was predominantly related to sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries. Refer to Corporate results on pages 40-42 and Note 9 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income: refer to Note 14 for additional information. Card income decreased, reflecting in CCB, an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, as well as lower net interchange income, partially offset by higher annual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Other income increased, reflecting: • higher auto operating lease income in CCB due to growth in volume, and • lower losses related to certain equity investments in CIB. Refer to CCB and CIB results on pages 22-26 and pages 27-34, respectively, for additional information. Net interest income increased driven by higher revolving balances in Card Services, higher Markets net interest income, and higher wholesale deposit balances. These factors were predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.9 trillion, up $274 billion, and the yield was 5.05%, down 50 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.45%, a decrease of 13 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.73%, down 13 bps. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on pages 192-193 for additional information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for an additional discussion of net yield excluding Markets. Year-to-date results Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by several large deals, • higher advisory fees predominantly benefiting from the closing of a higher number of large transactions, and • higher equity underwriting fees predominantly due to higher revenue from follow-on offerings and IPOs. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher Fixed Income Markets revenue primarily driven by higher revenue in Rates and Commodities, largely offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products, Fixed Income Financing and Currencies & Emerging Markets, and • higher Equity Markets revenue, particularly in Equity Derivatives. The increase in CIB was partially offset by lower revenue in Treasury and CIO. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income.

The prior year net loss was primarily related to sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries. Mortgage fees and related income: refer to Note 14 for additional information. Card income decreased driven by the net impact of: • lower income in CCB, reflecting an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, as well as lower net interchange income, partially offset by higher annual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments, and • higher card revenue in CIB Payments as a result of higher volume. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 27-34 for additional information. 10 Other income decreased, reflecting: • the absence in Corporate of several items recorded in the prior year, particularly the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by • higher auto operating lease income in CCB due to growth in volume, • the $588 million First Republic-related gain recorded in the first quarter of 2025, and • lower losses related to certain equity investments in CIB. Refer to Corporate results on pages 40-42 for additional information; and Note 5, and Note 34 on pages 319–321 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K, for additional information on the First Republic-related gain. Net interest income increased driven by higher Markets net interest income, higher revolving balances in Card Services, higher wholesale deposit balances, and the impact of investment securities activity including from prior quarters. These factors were largely offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.8 trillion, up $278 billion, and the yield was 5.09%, down 47 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.49%, a decrease of 15 bps.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making activities and the impact of lower levels of netting, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end. Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, reflecting higher demand for securities to cover short positions and higher client-driven activities. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt and equity instruments in Markets related to client- driven market-making activities, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end.

There was also an $863 million net addition to the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The net addition was predominantly driven by the impact of new lending-related commitments primarily in the second quarter of 2025. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 9-14 and pages 59-78, respectively, Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 87-89, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for additional information on loans and the total allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased predominantly due to higher client-driven activities in Markets. Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets: refer to Note 14 for additional information. Other assets increased primarily due to higher cash collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCP") in Markets, and higher auto operating lease assets in CCB. Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued) (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Change Liabilities Deposits $ 2,548,476 $ 2,406,032 6 % Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 567,574 296,835 91 Short-term borrowings 69,355 52,893 31 Trading liabilities 242,262 192,883 26 Accounts payable and other liabilities 316,896 280,672 13 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) 28,227 27,323 3 Long-term debt 427,203 401,418 6 Total liabilities 4,199,993 3,658,056 15 Stockholders’ equity 360,212 344,758 4 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 4,560,205 $ 4,002,814 14 % Deposits increased, reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB predominantly due to net inflows related to client-driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, and • a decrease in AWM primarily driven by migration into other investment products as a result of the maturity of higher-yielding product offerings, partially offset by growth in both new accounts and balances in existing accounts. Deposits in CCB were relatively flat, reflecting new accounts, offset by increased customer spending. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased driven by Markets, reflecting higher secured financing of trading assets, higher client-driven market-making activities, and the impact of lower levels of netting, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional information related to Firm- sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts. Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand, as well as an increase in the fair value of such instruments, and net issuances of long-term debt in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by a net reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58 for additional information. Stockholders’ equity increased, reflecting net income and lower unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly driven by the net impact of lower interest rates and widening spreads on cash flow hedges and AFS securities in Treasury and CIO, largely offset by the impact of capital actions, including net repurchases of common shares and dividend payments on common and preferred stock. Refer to Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 95, Capital Actions on page 48, and Note 19 for additional information. 16 Consolidated cash flows analysis The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures include: • Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The corresponding income tax impact related to tax- exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs; • Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense; • Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding Markets; • TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and • Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 67–69 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-GAAP financial measures.

There are three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed basis. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand- alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. As a result of lower average interest rates in the current year, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 79-85 for additional information. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity on page 47, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 70–90 and Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies. 20 Segment & Corporate Results – Managed basis The following tables summarize the Firm’s results by business segments and Corporate for the periods indicated.

(b) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $649 million and $387 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Net revenue was $19.5 billion, up 9%. Net interest income was $14.9 billion, up 9%, reflecting: • higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by higher revolving balances, and • higher NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"), predominantly driven by higher deposit margin, reflecting the impact of changes in the FTP. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page 20 for additional information on FTP. Noninterest revenue was $4.6 billion, up 10%, driven by: • higher auto operating lease income as a result of growth in volume, and • in BWM, higher asset management fees, reflecting higher average market levels and net inflows, as well as higher deposit-related fees as a result of new accounts and higher transaction volume, partially offset by • lower card income, reflecting an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs and lower net interchange, partially offset by higher annual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card income and asset management fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 87-89 for additional information on the credit card rewards liability. Noninterest expense was $10.3 billion, up 7%, reflecting: • higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto operating lease assets, and continued investments in marketing, as well as • higher compensation expense, primarily for bankers and advisors. The provision for credit losses was $2.5 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.0 billion, up $44 million, primarily driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses was $575 million, driven by loan growth in Card Services and updates to certain macroeconomic variables in Card Services and Home Lending, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. In the prior year, the provision was $2.8 billion, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion and the net addition to the allowance for credit losses was $876 million. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 59-78 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-77 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses. Year-to-date results Net income was $14.6 billion, up 12%. Net revenue was $56.6 billion, up 7%. Net interest income was $43.4 billion, up 6%, reflecting: • higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by higher revolving balances, and • higher NII in BWM, driven by higher deposit margin, reflecting the impact of changes in the FTP, partially offset by lower average deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $13.2 billion, up 9%, driven by: • higher auto operating lease income as a result of growth in volume, and • in BWM, higher asset management fees, reflecting higher average market levels and net inflows, as well as higher deposit-related fees as a result of new accounts and higher transaction volume, partially offset by • lower card income, reflecting an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs and lower net interchange, partially offset by higher annual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments. Noninterest expense was $30.0 billion, up 6%, reflecting: • higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto operating lease assets, and continued investments in marketing and technology, as well as • higher compensation expense, predominantly for bankers and advisors, and employees in technology. The provision for credit losses was $7.2 billion. Net charge-offs were $6.2 billion, up $341 million, primarily driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth.

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 81 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information. For the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net revenue was $6.1 billion, up 12%. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, up 5%. Noninterest revenue was $4.3 billion, up 14%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.9 billion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting strong net inflows and higher average market levels. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $3.2 billion, up 8%, driven by: • higher noninterest revenue as a result of higher management fees predominantly due to strong net inflows and higher brokerage fees, and • higher net interest income, driven by higher average loans and deposits, largely offset by narrower spreads on loans. Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, up 5%, driven by: • higher compensation, primarily higher revenue- related compensation and continued growth in private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees, largely offset by • lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $59 million, driven by the impact of a charge-off related to a client- specific exposure. Net charge-offs were $62 million, and the net reduction in the allowance for credit losses was $3 million. In the prior year, the provision was $4 million. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on lending related fees. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 59-78 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 75-77 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Revenue from Asset Management was $8.3 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting strong net inflows and higher average market levels. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $9.3 billion, up 9%, driven by: • higher noninterest revenue, reflecting: – higher management fees predominantly due to strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage fees, partially offset by – a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and • higher net interest income, driven by higher average loans and deposits, partially offset by narrower spreads on loans. Noninterest expense was $11.3 billion, up 6%, driven by: • higher compensation, primarily higher revenue- related compensation and continued growth in private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees, partially offset by • lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $95 million, largely driven by the impact of a charge-off related to a client- specific exposure. Net charge-offs were $62 million, and the net addition to the allowance for credit losses was $33 million.

Net revenue was $1.7 billion, compared with $3.1 billion in the prior year. Net interest income was $1.4 billion, down $1.5 billion, predominantly driven by the impact of lower rates and changes in the FTP for consumer deposits. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page 20 for additional information on FTP. Noninterest revenue was $297 million, compared with $155 million in the prior year, primarily driven by: • an increase associated with an equity investment, and • a net gain in investment securities as compared with a net loss in the prior year that was associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. The net gain was predominantly related to sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries. Refer to Note 9 and Note 12 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest expense was $445 million, compared with $589 million in the prior year. The current period income tax expense was driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, partially offset by tax benefits related to the Firm's 2024 U.S. federal tax return. Other Corporate includes the Firm's international consumer initiatives, which primarily consists of Chase U.K., Nutmeg (which was rebranded as J.P. Morgan Personal Investing as of November 3, 2025), and an ownership stake in C6 Bank. The deposits within Corporate relate to the Firm’s international consumer initiatives and have increased as a result of growth in client accounts. Year-to-date results Net income was $4.2 billion, compared with $9.3 billion in the prior year. Net revenue was $5.5 billion, compared with $15.4 billion in the prior year. Net interest income was $4.5 billion, down $3.2 billion, driven by the impact of changes in the FTP for consumer deposits and of lower rates, partially offset by the impact of investment securities activity including from prior quarters. Noninterest revenue was $999 million, compared with $7.6 billion in the prior year, driven by: • the absence of the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by • a net gain in investment securities as compared with a net loss in the prior year that was associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. The prior year net loss was primarily related to sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, and • the $588 million First Republic-related gain recorded in the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the First Republic-related gain. Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, down 66%, predominantly driven by: • lower FDIC-related expense driven by releases of FDIC special assessment accruals of $437 million, compared with an accrual increase of $725 million in the first quarter of the prior year, and • the absence of the following items recorded in the prior year: – a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, and – restructuring and integration costs associated with First Republic. The current period income tax expense was driven by: • changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, predominantly offset by • a $774 million income tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2025, driven by the resolution of certain tax audits and the impact of tax regulations related to foreign currency translation gains and losses finalized in 2024 and effective for 2025, • tax benefits related to the Firm's 2024 U.S. federal tax return, and • higher tax benefits related to the vesting of employee share-based awards. 41 Treasury and CIO overview At September 30, 2025, the average credit rating of the Treasury and CIO investment securities comprising the portfolio in the table below was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Risk governance framework The Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Refer to pages 91–95 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. Risk governance and oversight functions The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2024 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to oversee the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

Refer to pages 97–107 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s capital risk management. Basel III Overview The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating Basel III RWA: a standardized approach (“Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Advanced”). For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. As of September 30, 2025, the Firm’s Standardized risk-based ratios continue to be more binding than the Advanced risk-based ratios. Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, calculate their SLRs. Refer to page 47 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on SLR. Key Regulatory Developments Enhanced Supervisory Stress Test Transparency and Public Accountability Proposals In October 2025, the Federal Reserve issued proposals to enhance the transparency and public accountability of its annual supervisory stress test used to set the Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") for large bank holding companies, including the Firm. The proposals would require the Federal Reserve to publish comprehensive documentation of the supervisory stress test models and annual stress test scenarios for public comment, including the scenarios for the upcoming 2026 stress test. The proposals also introduce an enhanced disclosure process, under which material changes to stress test models and scenarios would be subject to public comment prior to implementation. Based on the Federal Reserve’s analysis, the proposed changes to the stress test models and scenarios are not expected to materially change the SCB for firms, such as JPMorganChase, that are subject to the supervisory stress test. SCB Volatility Reduction Proposal In April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to the calculation of the SCB for large bank holding companies, including the Firm. The proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using the average of supervisory stress results from the previous two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB. The proposal would also modify the annual effective date of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make targeted changes to reporting requirements to streamline data collection. Enhanced SLR Proposal In June 2025, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“eSLR”) requirements for Global Systemically Important Banks (“GSIB”) BHCs and their insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries by revising the current static leverage buffers at the BHC and IDI levels to 50 percent of the parent GSIB’s U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge, which is referred to as the “eSLR buffer.” In addition, the proposal would make corresponding adjustments to the leverage-based total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”) requirements by replacing the current TLAC leverage buffer with the eSLR buffer and replacing the current static leverage-based eligible LTD requirement with a requirement of 2.5% plus the eSLR buffer. Further, the proposal would remove the eSLR threshold for an IDI subsidiary of a U.S. GSIB to be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework and instead apply the eSLR as a capital buffer requirement. Refer to page 100 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10- K for information on the U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge. Refer to page 99 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for information on other Key Regulatory Developments. 44 Selected capital and RWA data The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

On September 16, 2025, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors had declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on October 31, 2025, an increase from the prior dividend of $1.40 per share. The Firm’s dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Common stock repurchases On July 1, 2025, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new $50 billion common share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2025. Through June 30, 2025, the Firm was authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its previously-approved common share repurchase program that was announced on June 28, 2024. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s discretion. The common share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors does not establish specific price targets or timetables. Management determines the amount and timing of common share repurchases based on various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital generation; current and proposed future capital requirements; and other investment opportunities. The amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases in any period may be substantially more or less than the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the decision- making process. The Firm’s common share repurchases may be suspended by management at any time. Refer to Capital actions on page 105 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information.

For a further discussion of the Firm's liquidity risk management, refer to pages 108–115 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K and to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar- day period of significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR framework. Three months ended Average amount (in millions) September 30, 2025 June 30, 2025 September 30, 2024 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: HQLA Eligible cash(a) $ 308,298 $ 349,403 $ 412,389 Eligible securities(b)(c) 638,020 572,533 453,899 Total HQLA(d) $ 946,318 $ 921,936 $ 866,288 Net cash outflows $ 858,157 $ 818,334 $ 762,072 LCR 110 % 113 % 114 % Net excess eligible HQLA(d) $ 88,161 $ 103,602 $ 104,216 JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.: LCR 117 % 120 % 121 % Net excess eligible HQLA $ 152,886 $ 170,765 $ 168,137 (a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are included at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule. (d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended June 30, 2025, predominantly due to the use of liquidity resources in support of Markets activities in CIB. The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by repurchases of and dividends on common stock and the use of liquidity resources in support of Markets activities in CIB, largely offset by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased compared with the three months ended June 30, 2025, due to loan growth, partially offset by higher deposits and higher market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by loan growth, predominantly offset by higher deposits. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to pages 109-110 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm manages liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted. 51 Liquidity sources In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $554 billion and $594 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2024, was driven by a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely offset by an increase in unencumbered CIB trading assets. The Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For each respective period, the amount was comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately $956 billion and $834 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $554 billion and $594 billion. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $444 billion and $413 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased compared to December 31, 2024 predominantly due to a higher amount of commercial loans and mortgages pledged at Federal Reserve Banks and the FHLBs. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's interpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for the quarters ended June 30, 2025 and March 31, 2025 on the Firm’s website for additional information. 52 Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short- term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off- balance sheet obligations. Deposits The table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and the average deposit balances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Average Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2025 2024 2025 2024 Consumer & Community Banking $ 1,058,388 $ 1,056,652 $ 1,058,025 $ 1,053,701 $ 1,057,371 $ 1,068,774 Commercial & Investment Bank 1,215,944 1,073,512 1,194,410 1,064,402 1,157,201 1,052,438 Asset & Wealth Management 239,999 248,287 241,454 236,470 244,635 230,560 Corporate 34,145 27,581 30,670 28,737 27,797 24,680 Total Firm $ 2,548,476 $ 2,406,032 $ 2,524,559 $ 2,383,310 $ 2,487,004 $ 2,376,452 The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from clients that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted. Average deposits increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the impact of: • an increase in CIB due to net inflows related to client- driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, partially offset by net maturities of structured notes in Markets, • an increase in AWM as a result of growth in both new accounts and balances in existing accounts, including the impact of higher-yielding product offerings, and • an increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts, offset by increased customer spending. Average deposits increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB due to net inflows related to client- driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, partially offset by net maturities of structured notes in Markets, • an increase in AWM as a result of growth in both new accounts and balances in existing accounts, including the impact of higher-yielding product offerings, and • a decrease in CCB primarily driven by increased customer spending, predominantly offset by new accounts. 53 Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2024, reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB predominantly due to net inflows related to client-driven activities in Payments and Securities Services, and • a decrease in AWM primarily driven by migration into other investment products as a result of the maturity of higher-yielding product offerings, partially offset by growth in both new accounts and balances in existing accounts. Deposits in CCB were relatively flat, reflecting new accounts, offset by increased customer spending. Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment & Corporate Results on pages 15-16 and pages 20-42, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3 for further information on structured notes. Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,548.1 billion and $1,414.0 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits. The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non- U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured funding is securities sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at September 30, 2025, compared with December 31, 2024, driven by Markets, reflecting higher secured financing of trading assets, higher client-driven market-making activities, and the impact of lower levels of netting, as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels at year- end. The increase in secured other borrowed funds at September 30, 2025 from December 31, 2024, and for the average three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior year periods, was primarily due to higher financing requirements in Markets. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured funding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. 56 Long-term funding Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. Unsecured funding and issuance The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The increase in structured notes at September 30, 2025 from December 31, 2024, and for the average three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior year periods, was primarily driven by net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in the fair value of such instruments. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 and Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Secured funding and issuance The Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB advances. The following table summarizes the securitization issuance, the FHLB advances, as well as other long-term secured funding sources with their respective maturities or redemptions, as applicable, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations. 57 Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Notes 4 and 13 for additional information. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and certain of its principal subsidiaries as of September 30, 2025 were as follows: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC J.P. Morgan Securities plc J.P.

Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and J.P. Morgan SE to stable from positive, and revised J.P. Morgan SE’s long-term issuer rating to Aa2 from Aa3. (b) On May 19, 2025, Moody’s revised JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s outlook to stable from developing, and this change was related to Moody’s one-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer rating of the U.S. Government announced on May 16, 2025. Moody’s also affirmed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s long-term issuer rating. Refer to page 115 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could affect the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the above subsidiaries. 58 CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance. (j) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $23.6 billion and $18.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $21.4 billion and $17.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates. 62 Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Loans were flat compared to December 31, 2024. Residential real estate The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans decreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by originations. Retained nonaccrual loans increased compared to December 31, 2024, primarily driven by forbearances granted to certain borrowers impacted by the wildfires in Los Angeles County, California in January 2025. Net recoveries were higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in the prior year, driven by loan sales in the current quarter. Loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual loans held-for-sale decreased from December 31, 2024, reflecting loan sales. Loans at fair value increased compared to December 31, 2024, as purchases outpaced sales in CIB and originations outpaced warehouse loan sales in Home Lending. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of retained interest-only residential mortgage loans was $88.6 billion and $88.9 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable- rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable to the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value of retained home equity lines of credit outstanding was $13.4 billion at September 30, 2025, including $3.4 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified, and $3.3 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by reducing or canceling the undrawn line in accordance with the contract or to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of the underlying property. The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

The portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in loans at fair value due to net purchases of other consumer unsecured loans in CIB. Net charge-offs decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower scored auto net charge-offs, reflecting improved used vehicle valuations. Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.

The September 30, 2025 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.14% and 1.07%, respectively, decreased compared to the December 31, 2024 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and 1.14%, respectively, in line with the Firm's expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflecting loan growth. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies. Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans. 65 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in- depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 68-71 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk- rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. As of September 30, 2025, loans increased by $84.4 billion, driven by higher loans in CIB, primarily in Markets, and higher securities-based lending in AWM, both associated with higher client demand. Lending- related commitments increased by $64.6 billion, driven by higher commitments in CIB, including held- for-sale commitments. As of September 30, 2025, nonperforming exposure increased by $939 million, driven by certain exposures in Technology, Media & Telecommunications, Oil & Gas, Utilities, and SPEs, in each case resulting from downgrades, partially offset by certain exposures in Real Estate and Healthcare, primarily due to charge-off activity, upgrades and paydowns.

The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. (c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. (d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30, 2025, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 67 Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $48.3 billion and $44.7 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, representing approximately 3.4% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $48.3 billion, $42.3 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Consumer & Retail, Healthcare, SPEs, and Banks & Finance Companies, primarily resulting from downgrades and new commitments, partially offset by Real Estate, primarily resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades. The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans recognized in noninterest revenue. Wholesale net charge-offs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to increases in Commercial and industrial, including in the Healthcare and Technology, Media, and Telecommunications industries, as well as estimated losses related to apparent borrower fraud in certain secured lending facilities.

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments. Receivables from customers Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses. Derivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-the- counter ("OTC") derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange- traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 85% and 86% at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $59.8 billion and $61.0 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative transactions. 73 The following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.

In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit- related notes. Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of: • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk- rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2025 was $29.1 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.2 billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: • $1.2 billion in wholesale, driven by net increases in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and changes in credit quality of client-specific exposures, partially offset by the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, including improvements in certain macroeconomic variables, and • $1.1 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth in Card Services and the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its weighted-average macroeconomic outlook included additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm further increased the weight placed on the adverse scenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm partially reduced the increase in weight implemented in the first quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.9% in the third quarter of 2026, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2026. The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at September 30, 2025 4Q25 2Q26 4Q26 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.5 % 4.7 % 4.5 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.0 % 1.5 % 1.9 % Central case assumptions at December 31, 2024 2Q25 4Q25 2Q26 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.5 % 4.3 % 4.3 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 2.0 % 1.9 % 1.8 % (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short- term realized gains with respect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At September 30, 2025, the size of the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $780.7 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 40-42 and Note 9 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 51-58 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 79-85 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Principal investment risk Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve based on market circumstances and in line with its strategic initiatives. The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. (in billions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Tax-oriented investments, primarily in alternative energy and affordable housing $ 34.0 $ 33.3 Private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets 11.1 9.1 Total carrying value $ 45.1 $ 42.4 Refer to page 140 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10- K for a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight. 78 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. Value-at-risk JPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals. Refer to page 143 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10- K for further information regarding VaR, including its inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages 146–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm. 79 The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

This reflects the non- additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components. (b) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. (c) Includes credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. (d) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa Class C common shares which the Firm disposed of in the second and third quarters of 2024. Effective April 1, 2025, the Firm refined the historical proxy time series inputs to one of its VaR models to more appropriately reflect the risk exposure from certain securitization warehousing loan positions. With this refined time series, the average Total VaR and each of the components would have been lower by the amounts reported in the following table: (In millions) Amounts by which reported average VaR would have been lower for the period ended: September 30, 2024 CIB trading VaR by risk type: Fixed income $ (6) CIB trading VaR (4) CIB VaR (5) Total VaR (4) Quarter over quarter results Average total VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by $9 million, when compared with June 30, 2025, predominantly due to changes in the commodities and other and equities risk types. Year over year results Average total VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by $12 million compared with the same period in the prior year due to decreased Visa Class C common share exposure in Corporate VaR and reduced market volatility impacting the fixed income risk type, partially offset by increases in the commodities and other risk type. 80 The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movements in the first quarter of 2025 were due to a client-driven equity position that has since matured.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 171 of the 259 days, and observed 11 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 50 of the 66 days, and observed one VaR backtesting exception. The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended September 30, 2025. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions. Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses 82 Structural interest rate risk management The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities which are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to the table on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained and held-for- sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing activities, investment securities, long-term debt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. These simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange exposures arising from capital investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for more information. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short- term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short- term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: • The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that require management judgment. The amount of deposits that the Firm holds at any given time may be influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as broader monetary conditions and competition for deposits. • The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits. The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures of the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s actual net interest income for the rate changes presented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients or customers in response to rate changes. Other significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit rates paid, may also differ from actual results. The Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included in the Firm’s outlook on page 8. 83 The Firm’s sensitivities are presented in the table below. (In billions) September 30, 2025(a) December 31, 2024(a) Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 1.8 $ 2.3 -100 bps shift in rates (2.2) (2.5) +200 bps shift in rates 3.3 4.6 -200 bps shift in rates (5.2) (4.9) Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 1.5 1.0 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.7) (1.4) Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.4 1.2 -100 bps shift in long-term rates (1.5) (1.1) (a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates, including hedges of non-U.S. dollar capital investments. Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant. The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of September 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the net impact of Treasury and CIO actual and forecasted actions, which primarily consist of an increase in cash flow hedges of floating rate loans and in investment securities activity, both of which add duration. This was partially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits. Economic value sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value measurement note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 112 in Note 2. 84 Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk- sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 150–151 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2025 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2024. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure to Germany when compared to December 31, 2024 was predominantly driven by higher client deposits, resulting in increased cash placements with the central bank of Germany. The increase in exposure to the United Kingdom when compared to December 31, 2024 was predominantly driven by higher client deposits and client-driven activities, resulting in higher holdings of government debt securities and increased cash placements with the central bank of the United Kingdom. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to Russia is not material. Refer to Note 24 on pages 186– 187 for information concerning Russian litigation.

Market-making positions and hedging includes exposure from single reference entity (“single-name”), index and other multiple reference entity transactions for which one or more of the underlying reference entities is in a country listed in the above table. (e) Includes physical commodities inventory and clearing house guarantee funds. (f) The country rankings presented in the table as of December 31, 2024, are based on the country rankings of the corresponding exposures at September 30, 2025, not actual rankings of such exposures at December 31, 2024. 86 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM JPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off- balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises: • The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk- rated), • The allowance for lending-related commitments, and • The allowance for credit losses on investment securities. The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-77 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information. One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight- quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio and geography. • Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI. • Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI. Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.6% in the third quarter of 2026. This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: • The allowance as of September 30, 2025, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. 87 • The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2025, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: • An increase of approximately $1.3 billion for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of approximately $3.8 billion for credit card loans • An increase of approximately $5.2 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended September 30, 2025. Fair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including trading assets and liabilities, AFS securities, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information. September 30, 2025 (in millions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 404,609 $ — Securities borrowed 104,757 — Trading assets: Trading–debt and equity instruments 892,928 2,689 Derivative receivables(a) 59,849 9,667 Total trading assets 952,777 12,356 AFS securities 490,499 101 Loans 54,686 2,494 MSRs 9,110 9,110 Other 16,302 1,380 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis 2,032,740 25,441 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 1,665 1,223 Total assets measured at fair value $ 2,034,405 $ 26,664 Total Firm assets $ 4,560,205 Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 1 % Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 1 % (a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $9.7 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. 88 Valuation Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Credit card rewards liability The credit card rewards liability was $15.9 billion and $14.4 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers that has outpaced redemptions throughout 2025. Refer to pages 163–164 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability. Income taxes Refer to Income taxes on page 164 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. Goodwill impairment Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 163 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of September 30, 2025. Litigation reserves Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves. 89 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS FASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures Issued December 2023 • Requires disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by 1) federal, state, and foreign taxes and 2) individual jurisdiction on the basis of a quantitative threshold of equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). • Requires disclosure of the effective tax rate reconciliation by specific categories, at a minimum, with accompanying qualitative disclosures, and separate disclosure of reconciling items based on quantitative thresholds. • Requires categories within the effective tax rate reconciliation to be further disaggregated if quantitative thresholds are met. • Required effective date: Annual financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2025. • The guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted. • The Firm plans to present the expanded income tax disclosures using a retrospective application in its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ending December 31, 2025.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further discussion of the Firm's reportable business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The preparation of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorganChase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. 97 Note 2 – Fair value measurement Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy. 98 The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

which were mortgage-related. (b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in 100 fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $839 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, primarily reported in other assets. (e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Level 3 valuations Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. 101 Level 3 inputs(a) September 30, 2025 Product/Instrument Fair value (in millions) Principal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g) Range of input values Average(i) Residential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b) $ 898 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% 111% 6% Prepayment speed 6% 14% 9% Conditional default rate 0% 2% 0% Loss severity 0% 110% 5% Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c) 1,234 Market comparables Price $0 $84 $80 Corporate debt securities 548 Market comparables Price $0 $177 $102 Loans(d) 1,755 Market comparables Price $0 $103 $76 Non-U.S. government debt securities 219 Market comparables Price $2 $122 $99 Net interest rate derivatives 1,504 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 25 bps 712 bps 102 bps Interest rate spread volatility 37 bps 77 bps 64 bps Bermudan switch value 0% 46% 16% Interest rate correlation (64)% 97% 61% IR-FX correlation (35)% 50% 2% 1 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 0% 20% 5% Net credit derivatives (1,271) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 34% 79% 51% Credit spread 0 bps 6,947 bps 440 bps Recovery rate 10% 90% 51% 39 Market comparables Price $0 $115 $75 Net foreign exchange derivatives 383 Option pricing IR-FX correlation (40)% 60% 16% (53) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 11% 11% Interest rate curve 2% 30% 6% Net equity derivatives (3,314) Option pricing Forward equity price(h) 77% 144% 101% Equity volatility 3% 137% 31% Equity correlation 0% 100% 54% Equity-FX correlation (75)% 65% (32)% Equity-IR correlation 5% 10% 9% Net commodity derivatives 120 Option pricing Oil commodity forward $38 / BBL $304 / BBL $138 / BBL Natural gas commodity forward $2 / MMBTU $6 / MMBTU $3 / MMBTU Commodity volatility 2% 48% 6% Commodity correlation (30)% 82% 2% MSRs 9,110 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 14 Long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e) 49,514 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 25 bps 712 bps 102 bps Bermudan switch value 0% 46% 16% Interest rate correlation (64)% 97% 61% IR-FX correlation (35)% 50% 2% Equity volatility 0% 126% 29% Equity correlation 0% 100% 54% Equity-FX correlation (75)% 65% (32)% Equity-IR correlation 5% 10% 9% 1,322 Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 33% 77% 51% Credit spread 1 bps 345 bps 57 bps Recovery rate 20% 40% 37% Yield 5% 20% 11% Loss severity 0% 100% 50% Other level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f) 1,879 (a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $324 million, nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $569 million. (c) Comprises nonagency securities of $13 million, trading loans of $66 million and non-trading loans of $1.2 billion. (d) Comprises trading loans of $985 million and non-trading loans of $770 million. (e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) Includes equity securities of $906 million, including $807 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. (h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price. (i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used. 102 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments. 103 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Three months ended September 30, 2025 (in millions) Fair value at Jul. 1, 2025 Total realized/ unrealized gains/

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2024, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 110 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 Level 3 assets were $25.4 billion at September 30, 2025, reflecting a decrease of $53 million from June 30, 2025, and an increase of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2024. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was predominantly driven by higher: • Other trading assets of $301 million due to gains and purchases. • Gross derivative receivables of $1.2 billion due to gains and purchases primarily offset by settlements and net transfers. Refer to the sections below for additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $914 million and $1.2 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $908 million of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $782 million of trading loans driven by an increase in observability. • $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $1.4 billion of long-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs for structured notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $841 million and $1.1 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $765 million and $1.3 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. 108 All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 103-108 for further information on these instruments. Three months ended September 30, 2025 • $252 million of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in other trading assets and net derivative receivables due to market movements. • $2.1 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Three months ended September 30, 2024 • $1.3 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net derivative receivables due to market movements. • $1.8 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Nine months ended September 30, 2025 • $4.3 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net derivative receivables due to market movements. • $4.7 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 • $1.1 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net derivative receivables and loans due to market movements as well as MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $2.3 billion of net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in long-term debt due to market movements. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Of the $765 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2025, $687 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value adjustments have been recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes. (b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2025 were $1.3 billion. (c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2025 were $(1.5) billion. Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6 million Visa Class B-2 common shares ("Visa B-2 shares") reflected in the Firm's principal investment portfolio at both September 30, 2025 and 2024. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5223 at September 30, 2025 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2025, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis. Separately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. As of September 30, 2025, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 11.6 million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. (b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments. The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments with or without notice to the borrower, as permitted by law, or in accordance with the contract. Refer to page 183 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments. 112 Note 3 – Fair value option The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument- specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. (b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. (e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense. 114 Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Loans Nonaccrual loans Loans reported as trading assets $ 3,306 $ 608 $ (2,698) $ 3,429 $ 464 $ (2,965) Loans 1,583 1,305 (278) 1,711 1,492 (219) Subtotal 4,889 1,913 (2,976) 5,140 1,956 (3,184) 90 or more days past due and government guaranteed Loans(a) 123 119 (4) 50 45 (5) All other performing loans(b) Loans reported as trading assets 14,138 12,620 (1,518) 12,171 10,852 (1,319) Loans(c) 53,597 53,262 (335) 40,342 39,813 (529) Subtotal 67,735 65,882 (1,853) 52,513 50,665 (1,848) Total loans $ 72,747 $ 67,914 $ (4,833) $ 57,703 $ 52,666 $ (5,037) Long-term debt Principal-protected debt $ 70,964 (e) $ 61,024 $ (9,940) $ 57,414 (e) $ 47,780 $ (9,634) Nonprincipal-protected debt(d) NA 63,154 NA NA 53,000 NA Total long-term debt NA $ 124,178 NA NA $ 100,780 NA Long-term beneficial interests Nonprincipal-protected debt(d) NA $ 8 NA NA $ 1 NA Total long-term beneficial interests NA $ 8 NA NA $ 1 NA (a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. (b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. (c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due. (d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal- protected notes. (e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $19.5 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(2) million and $50 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments. 115 Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk component The following table presents the fair value of structured notes, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts. While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is simply a reference amount used to calculate payments. 118 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated balance sheets The following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.

Refer to Note 3 for further information. (b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. 119 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables.

For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. (c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $51.1 billion and $51.9 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $54.9 billion and $60.8 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. 121 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit- related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 18,477 $ 15,371 Collateral posted 18,910 15,204 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. (f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 123 As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $34.7 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt was $587 million and $518 million, respectively. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $97.6 billion and $72.8 billion, of which $72.0 billion and $41.2 billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $391 million and $(1.7) billion, which is comprised of $1.2 billion and $(1.2) billion for active hedging relationships, and $(781) million and $(566) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 9 for additional information. (d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods. (e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships. 124 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended September 30, 2025 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (677) $ (87) $ 590 Foreign exchange(b) (1) (177) (176) Total $ (678) $ (264) $ 414 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (716) $ 2,071 $ 2,787 Foreign exchange(b) 43 242 199 Total $ (673) $ 2,313 $ 2,986 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Nine months ended September 30, 2025 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (1,928) $ 2,523 $ 4,451 Foreign exchange(b) 37 222 185 Total $ (1,891) $ 2,745 $ 4,636 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (1,998) $ (330) $ 1,668 Foreign exchange(b) 81 198 117 Total $ (1,917) $ (132) $ 1,785 (a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.0) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at September 30, 2025, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately ten years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 125 Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (d) Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market- making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue. 127 Credit derivatives Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. Also includes credit protection against certain loans and lending-related commitments in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and credit-related notes. 128 The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, where JPMorganChase is the seller of protection.

The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee share-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2025 2024 2025 2024 Cost of prior grants of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”) and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 348 $ 359 $ 1,152 $ 1,224 Accrual of estimated costs of share- based awards to be granted in future periods, predominantly those to full-career eligible employees 562 490 1,770 1,507 Total noncash compensation expense related to employee share- based incentive plans $ 910 $ 849 $ 2,922 $ 2,731 In the first quarter of 2025, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2024 performance year, the Firm granted 12 million RSUs and 462 thousand PSUs with weighted-average grant date fair values of $259.74 per RSU and $261.10 per PSU. 134 Note 9 – Investment securities Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At September 30, 2025, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). During the third quarter of 2025, the Firm transferred $44.1 billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for asset-liability management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $575 million on the securities at the date of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers of securities between AFS and HTM are non- cash transactions. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio. 135 The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.

The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $35 million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2025. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $70 million at September 30, 2025. (c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven years for agency residential MBS, six years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 139 Note 10 – Securities financing activities Refer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(b) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related net asset or liability with that counterparty.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. 141 Note 11 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale(c)(d) • Residential real estate(a) • Auto and other(b) • Credit card loans • Secured by real estate • Commercial and industrial • Other(e) (a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB. (b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB. (c) Includes loans held in CIB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. (d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") in effect at each period presented, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower. (e) Includes loans to financial institutions, SPEs, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

These loans include home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment- option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated. Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period. 145 Nonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators The following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential real estate loans.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2025, approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due. (b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. (c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative. (d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $35 million and $38 million and $109 million and $123 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. (e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality. (h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. (i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available. (j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at September 30, 2025. 146 Loan modifications The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment deferral and principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information. Financial effects of FDMs For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, retained residential real estate FDMs were $135 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, which included $77 million and $894 million, respectively, of FDMs in the form of other-than-insignificant payment deferrals. These other-than-insignificant payment deferrals were driven by forbearances granted to certain borrowers impacted by the wildfires in Los Angeles County, California in January 2025 who were granted a second 90-day forbearance arrangement. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the financial effects of the remaining FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 17 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.16% to 6.53%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the financial effects of the remaining FDMs, which were largely in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 17 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.09% to 6.15%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, retained residential real estate FDMs were $74 million and $188 million, respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 8 years for both periods, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 7.78% to 5.78% and 7.81% to 5.37% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, additional unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs were not material, while there were no additional unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, loans subject to a trial modification, where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, and Chapter 7 loans were not material. Payment status of FDMs The following table provides information on the payment status of retained residential real estate FDMs during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. (in millions) Amortized cost basis Twelve months ended September 30, 2025 2024 Current $ 356 $ 143 30-149 days past due 76 45 150 or more days past due 630 23 Total $ 1,062 $ 211 Defaults of FDMs Retained residential real estate FDMs that defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were not material. FDMs that defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were $44 million and $74 million, respectively. Active and suspended foreclosure At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm had retained residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $541 million and $576 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. 147 Auto and other Delinquency is the primary credit quality indicator for retained auto and other loans.

These modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Payment status of FDMs The following table provides information on the payment status of retained credit card FDMs during the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. (in millions) Amortized cost basis Twelve months ended September 30, 2025 2024 Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing $ 1,438 $ 757 30-89 days past due and still accruing 134 70 90 or more days past due and still accruing 70 41 Total $ 1,642 $ 868 Defaults of FDMs Retained credit card FDMs that defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were $56 million and $75 million, respectively. FDMs that defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were not material. For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. 151 Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals.

(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual risk-rated loans. (c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) At September 30, 2025 and 2024, lending-related commitments excluded $22.4 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $1.1 trillion and $989.6 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $50.2 billion and $26.6 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. 160 Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2025 was $29.1 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.2 billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included: • $1.2 billion in wholesale, driven by net increases in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and changes in credit quality of client-specific exposures, partially offset by the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, including improvements in certain macroeconomic variables, and • $1.1 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth in Card Services and the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its weighted-average macroeconomic outlook included additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm further increased the weight placed on the adverse scenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm partially reduced the increase in weight implemented in the first quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.9% in the third quarter of 2026, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2026. The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at September 30, 2025 4Q25 2Q26 4Q26 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.5 % 4.7 % 4.5 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 1.0 % 1.5 % 1.9 % Central case assumptions at December 31, 2024 2Q25 4Q25 2Q26 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 4.5 % 4.3 % 4.3 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b) 2.0 % 1.9 % 1.8 % (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

Refer to pages 165–166 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties. Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. 162 The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests. Refer to page 168 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies and liquidation losses.

(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions. (e) At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 70% and 77%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $4.0 billion and $2.9 billion of investment-grade retained interests at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and $460 million and $216 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $6.5 billion and $6.0 billion of investment-grade retained interests at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. 163 Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. Re-securitizations The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2025 2024 2025 2024 Transfers of securities to VIEs U.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 9,625 $ 12,353 $ 19,823 $ 33,531 The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re-securitization VIEs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were not material. The following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs. Nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 U.S. GSEs and government agencies Interest in VIEs $ 2,778 $ 3,219 As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-securitization VIEs. As of September 30, 2025, the Firm consolidated an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities of Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm did not consolidate any Firm-sponsored private- label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $2.3 billion and $2.9 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending- related commitments to certain clients of the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $10.2 billion and $10.3 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. 164 Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB. (c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $6.0 billion and $5.5 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. (f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $35.7 billion and $35.2 billion, of which $14.6 billion and $15.0 billion was unfunded, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold 165 varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm elected the proportional amortization method for certain tax-oriented investments on a program-by-program basis. The proportional amortization method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. In addition, under this method deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity contributions that are unconditional and legally binding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period, there were no significant modifications or events that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. The following table provides information on tax- oriented investments for which the Firm elected to apply the proportional amortization method. (in millions) Alternative energy and affordable housing programs Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Programs for which the Firm elected proportional amortization: Carrying value(a) $ 32,335 $ 31,778 $ 32,335 $ 31,778 Tax credits and other tax benefits(b) 1,431 1,280 4,230 4,067 Investments that qualify to be accounted for using proportional amortization: Amortization losses recognized as a component of income tax expense (1,075) (1,006) (3,105) (3,157) Non-income-tax-related gains/(losses) and other returns received that are recognized outside of income tax expense(c) 29 28 108 96 (a) Recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(b) Reflected in Income tax expense on the Consolidated statements of income and Operating activities on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. (c) Recorded in Other income on the Consolidated statements of income and Operating activities on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $7.0 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $9.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. 166 Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Excludes loan securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies. (e) Includes commercial mortgages and auto loans. Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government- sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.

(e) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. 167 Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Loans repurchased or option to repurchase(a) $ 920 $ 577 Real estate owned 3 6 Foreclosed government- guaranteed residential mortgage loans(b) 9 10 (a) Primarily all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools.

Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about components of and delinquencies related to nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing involvement as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is the Firm’s only form of continuing involvement, the Firm generally experiences a loss only if the Firm was required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with its loan sale or servicing contracts.

Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and can be adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as additional information pertaining to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate. (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Consumer & Community Banking $ 32,116 $ 32,116 Commercial & Investment Bank 11,256 11,236 Asset & Wealth Management 8,622 8,521 Corporate 723 692 Total goodwill $ 52,717 $ 52,565 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2025 2024 2025 2024 Balance at beginning of period $ 52,747 $ 52,620 $ 52,565 $ 52,634 Changes during the period from: Business combinations — — — 29 Other(a) (30) 91 152 48 Balance at September 30, $ 52,717 $ 52,711 $ 52,717 $ 52,711 (a) Primarily foreign currency adjustments and an immaterial amount of goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended September 30, 2025. Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of September 30, 2025, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. 169 Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. As of or for the three months ended September 30, As of or for the nine months ended September 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2025 2024 2025 2024 Fair value at beginning of period $ 8,996 $ 8,847 $ 9,121 $ 8,522 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 102 75 297 228 Purchase of MSRs(a) 246 282 526 607 Disposition of MSRs 1 2 8 (25) (e) Net additions/(dispositions) 349 359 831 810 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (266) (272) (799) (795) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) (3) (251) (44) 134 Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) (37) 95 (36) 102 Discount rates — 14 (1) 14 Prepayment model changes and other(c) 71 (39) 38 (34) Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions 34 70 1 82 Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions 31 (181) (43) 216 Fair value at September 30, $ 9,110 $ 8,753 $ 9,110 $ 8,753 Changes in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at September 30, $ 31 $ (181) $ (43) $ 216 Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 404 396 1,218 1,190 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at September 30, (in billions) 669 658 669 658 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at September 30(d) 415 501 415 501 (a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. (e) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. 170 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in millions) 2025 2024 2025 2024 CCB mortgage fees and related income Production revenue $ 173 $ 154 $ 434 $ 441 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 409 409 1,233 1,226 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (265) (273) (796) (795) Total operating revenue 144 136 437 431 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a) (3) (251) (44) 134 Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b) 34 70 1 82 Changes in derivative fair value and other 24 281 154 (78) Total risk management 55 100 111 138 Total net mortgage servicing revenue 199 236 548 569 Total CCB mortgage fees and related income 372 390 982 1,010 All other 11 12 42 15 Mortgage fees and related income $ 383 $ 402 $ 1,024 $ 1,025 (a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates) Sep 30, 2025 Dec 31, 2024 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate) 6.74 % 6.19 % Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (181) $ (209) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (353) (406) Weighted-average option adjusted spread(a) 6.15 % 5.97 % Impact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change $ (392) $ (391) Impact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change (754) (751) (a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital. 171 Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits. The Firm’s intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed periodically for impairment. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the net carrying values of other intangible assets consisted of finite-lived intangible assets of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, as well as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $1.2 billion at both periods. 172 Note 15 – Deposits Refer to Note 17 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on deposits.

Firm as lessee At September 30, 2025, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases were as follows: (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Right-of-use assets $ 8,895 $ 8,494 Lease liabilities 9,314 8,900 The Firm’s net rental expense was $605 million and $553 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital requirements established by its primary regulators. The following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were subject as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, was phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period and fully phased out as of January 1, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining benefit of $720 million associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. Similarly, as of January 1, 2025, the Firm has phased out the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions. 179 The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of underlying property. 181 Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments Contractual amount Carrying value(h)(i) September 30, 2025 Dec 31, 2024 Sep 30, 2025 Dec 31, 2024 By remaining maturity (in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after 1 year through 3 years Expires after 3 years through 5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total Lending-related Consumer, excluding credit card: Residential Real Estate(a) $ 17,227 $ 6,113 $ 3,694 $ 6,565 $ 33,599 $ 30,349 $ 365 $ 534 Auto and other 10,581 1 4 3,830 14,416 14,495 10 37 Total consumer, excluding credit card 27,808 6,114 3,698 10,395 48,015 44,844 375 571 Credit card(b) 1,069,963 — — — 1,069,963 1,001,311 — — Total consumer(c) 1,097,771 6,114 3,698 10,395 1,117,978 1,046,155 375 571 Wholesale: Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(d) 121,187 206,396 206,311 29,230 563,124 498,437 3,243 2,608 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(d) 15,308 8,241 4,793 550 28,892 28,676 601 473 Other letters of credit(d) 3,474 312 7 219 4,012 4,354 12 37 Total wholesale(c) 139,969 214,949 211,111 29,999 596,028 531,467 3,856 3,118 Total lending-related $ 1,237,740 $ 221,063 $ 214,809 $ 40,394 $ 1,714,006 $ 1,577,622 $ 4,231 $ 3,689 Other guarantees and commitments Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(e) $ 386,993 $ — $ — $ — $ 386,993 $ 310,046 $ — $ — Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 3,524 693 9,531 37,154 50,902 49,628 11 113 Unsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 135,013 — 1,250 — 136,263 115,939 — 2 Unsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 117,212 588 — — 117,800 66,986 — (2) Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications: Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 36 45 Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 1,899 1,189 20 23 Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments(f) 342,887 NA NA NA 342,887 401,486 — — Other guarantees and commitments(g) 14,634 991 442 791 16,858 12,396 18 28 (a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value includes the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value. (i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts or premiums that are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Deferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected to fund, are amortized to lending- and deposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred amounts remain deferred until the commitment funds or is sold. 182 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

Refer to Note 11 for further information on internal risk ratings. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives. The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. (in millions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Notional amounts Derivative guarantees $ 50,902 $ 49,628 Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 34,963 32,939 Maximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 1,307 1,740 Fair value Derivative payables 11 113 In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation. 183 Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 182. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long- term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 182 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral Refer to Note 29 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral. Pledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the carrying value of the Firm’s pledged assets. (in billions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 255.9 $ 152.5 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 387.4 297.9 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 733.1 724.0 Total pledged assets $ 1,376.4 $ 1,174.4 Total pledged assets do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt. Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. (in billions) September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,829.9 $ 1,544.0 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,439.9 1,210.7 184 Note 24 – Litigation Contingencies As of September 30, 2025, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.2 billion at September 30, 2025. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleged “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In August 2025, the Firm resolved the civil litigation by entering into a settlement agreement with 1MDB and the Government of Malaysia. Under the terms of that agreement, the Firm paid approximately $330 million to 1MDB for the withdrawal of all pending appeals relating to the Malaysian civil litigation and a release of any and all future claims by 1MDB. In addition, in August 2025, the Firm resolved through the entry of a Summary Penalty Order (“SPO”) the investigation by the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland, which, in November 2023, had notified J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA that it was conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for the period September 2009 through August 2015. Under the terms of the SPO, which was entered without any admission of guilt or liability, J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA paid a fine of approximately $3.8 million. Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. 185 Fair Access to Banking. In August 2025, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order entitled “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans” that addressed access to financial services and directed several actions by certain federal agencies, to include a review and revision of their internal policies and manuals. JPMorganChase is responding to requests from government authorities and other external parties regarding, among other things, the Firm’s policies and processes and the provision of services to customers and potential customers. Certain of these matters are at various stages, including reviews, investigations, and legal proceedings. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-year disqualification period, which began in January 2017. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX- related individual and putative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. In Australia, the Federal Court of Australia has approved the settlement of the class action. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their respective network rules and system- wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are engaged in ongoing settlement negotiations. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over 80% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. A number of these actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and that court has scheduled a trial of the claims brought by several merchants to begin in April 2026. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm was named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Firm obtained dismissals of certain actions and resolved other actions. In September 2025, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all remaining claims related to U.S. dollar LIBOR, decertified the class, and dismissed all claims in their entirety with prejudice to refiling. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal. Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the 186 sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment against the Firm in a number of claims. This includes one claim for $439 million that is now enforceable against the Firm's unprotected assets in Russia, and a judgment for another claim has been executed against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. Russian courts have allowed plaintiffs to withhold dividends due to the Firm’s clients for the purpose of satisfying judgments, which the Firm is opposing as unlawful. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian courts' decisions, but certain judgments are now enforceable against Firm assets in Russia. Russian courts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination of certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets could also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. Shareholder Litigation. A shareholder derivative action purporting to act on behalf of the Firm is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $62 million and $259 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period. 187 Note 25 – Business segments & Corporate The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 67 for a definition of managed basis and Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand- alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. As a result of lower average interest rates in the current year, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. 188 Segment & Corporate results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 14, 2025, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. November 4, 2025 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 191 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Amortized cost: Amount at which a financing receivable or investment is originated or acquired, adjusted for accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash, charge-offs, foreign exchange, and fair value hedge accounting adjustments. For AFS securities, amortized cost is also reduced by any impairment losses recognized in earnings. Amortized cost is not reduced by the allowance for credit losses, except where explicitly presented net. AOCI: Accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) ARM(s): Adjustable rate mortgage(s) AUC: “Assets under custody”: Represents assets held directly or indirectly on behalf of clients under safekeeping, custody and servicing arrangements.

Client investment assets: Represent assets under management as well as custody, brokerage and annuity accounts, and deposits held in investment accounts. CLTV: Combined loan-to-value CMT: Constant Maturity Treasury Collateral-dependent: A loan is considered to be collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is deemed probable based on borrower delinquency. Commercial Card: Provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions. Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

Eligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria Embedded derivatives: Implicit or explicit terms or features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non- derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

J.P. Morgan Securities: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC JPMSE: J.P. Morgan SE LCR: Liquidity coverage ratio LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate LLC: Limited Liability Company LOB: Line of business LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio: The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio: An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio: The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Macro businesses: The macro businesses include Rates, Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income Markets. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable- equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Markets: Consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). 196 MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Through Merchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies. MEVs: "Macroeconomic variables": Refer to quantitative measures of current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions - such as the unemployment rates, gross domestic product growth rate and interest rates - used by the Firm in its models to estimate credit losses. Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

NFA: National Futures Association NM: Not meaningful Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on 197 nonaccrual status.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: Represents unvested share- based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorganChase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than- insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum capital requirements, defines eligible capital instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA. Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three “Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market discipline through disclosure requirements which allow market participants to assess the risk and capital profiles of banks. PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority Preferred stock dividends: Reflects dividends declared and deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred stock Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid- offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client- driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Standardized and Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance: Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5- star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk- adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class. 202 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.

The Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiary charged fees of the equivalent of approximately USD 850 from the time the account holder became employed by the applicable entity through the third quarter of 2025.
