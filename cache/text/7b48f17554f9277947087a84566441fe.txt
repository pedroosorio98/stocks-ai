Overall results benefited from the impact of lower bankruptcies in Card Services and were negatively affected by the incremental expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R . Our businesses generally experienced underlying growth in customer accounts, loans, deposits, assets under management, and business volumes from new and existing clients. Additionally, the Investment Bank had strong fee income and improved trading performance. We are also pleased to see the progress in the Corporate segment's results.” Commenting on the recent agreement to purchase the Bank of New York’s Retail and Middle Market Banking businesses in exchange for the firm’s Corporate Trust business , Mr. Dimon remarked, “We are excited by the unique opportunity to add $15 billion in deposits, over 300 branches, and 400 ATMs to our New York City/Tri -State franchise.

We also remain committed to our processing and securities services businesses, which have important linkages to our other businesses and clients.” JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net income was up 27% from the prior quarter reflecting significantly higher net revenues offset primarily by higher performance-based compensation, an increase in the provision fo r credit losses due to higher loan balances and incremental expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R.

Equity underwriting fees of $212 million were down 11% from the prior year, reflecting lower market share. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $ 2.0 billion was down 13% from the prior ye ar due to weaker performance in commodities and rates markets, partially offset by stronger results in emerging markets, currencies and credit markets.

Current and prior period results included charges to transfer automobile loans to held-for-sale and prior- year results also included a charge for the termination of an Education Finance joint venture and a gain on the sale of a recreational vehicle loan portfolio. Excluding all of these items, net income declined by $131 million or 13%. The decrease reflected weakness in M ortgage Banking and continued spread compression on deposits and loans in Regional Banking, as well as continued investment in the retail distribution network. These declines were offset partially by deposit and loan balance growth in Regional Banking and continued favorable credit quality in all loan portfolios. Net revenue of $3.8 billion was down by $84 million, or 2% , from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.6 billion declined by $91 million, or 3%, reflecting narrower spreads on deposits and loans in Regional Banking as well as reduced balances in the auto loan and lease portfolios. These decreases were offset partially by increased deposit balances and higher levels of home equity loans. Noninterest revenue of $1.2 billion was up by $7 milli on, or 1%, driven by higher automobile operating lease income and increased fee inco me on deposit-related products. These increases were offset by lower Mortgage Banking production and servicing income. Current quarter r esults also included a $50 million write -down on $1.3 billion of automobile loans transferred to held-for-sale, compared with an $88 million write-down last year on $2.7 billon of auto loans transferred to held-for-sale. The provision for credit losses totaled $85 million, down by $9 mill ion from the prior year. Credit quality continued to be favorable across all businesses. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 Noninterest expense of $2.2 billion was up by $76 million, or 4%, as a result of ongoing investments in the retail distribution network, higher depreciation expense on owned automobiles acquired under operating leases , and incremental expense of $17 million from the adoption of SFAS 123R. These increases were offset in part by operating and merger -related efficiencies and the absence of a $40 million charge related to the dissolution of an Education Finance joint venture. Regional Banking net income totaled $757 million, down by $29 million, or 4% , from the prior year. Net revenue of $3.0 billion increased by $3 million , essentially flat from the prior year. Results reflected higher deposit balances, growth in home equity and mortgage loan balances, and increased deposit -related fees. These increases were offset by narrower spreads on deposits and loans, and lower investment sales revenue. Credit quality remained favorable for all loan portfolios. Expenses of $1.7 billion were up by $33 million, or 2% , from the prior year. Prior -year results included a $40 million charge to terminate an Education Finance joint venture. Excluding this item, expenses increased as i nvestments in the retail distribution network and incremental expense from the adoption of SFAS 123R offset merger savings and other operating efficiencies. Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased 13%, in part due to the seasonal tax-refund anticipation business. Highlights Include: § Announced agreement to acquire The Bank of New York’s consumer and small business banking franchises— which will add 338 branches, 400 ATMs, $12.9 billion of deposits and $4.9 billion of loans. § Completed the purc hase of Collegiate Funding Services on March 1, 2006 , adding $6 billion in education loans, providing servicing capability and entry into the Federal Family Education Loan Program consolidation market. § Checking accounts grew by 143,000, to 8.9 million, during the quarter. § Average total deposits increased to $185 billion, up 6% from the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. § Branch sales of credit cards increased by 6 1% from the prior year and 3 2% from the prior quarter. § Overhead ratio (excluding amo rtization of core deposit intangible) increased to 54% from 52% in the prior year and remained flat from the prior quarter. § Number of branches increased to 2,638, up by 121 from the prior year and down 3 from the prior quarter. § Average mortgage loans reta ined of $44.6 billion increased 3%; period -end mortgage loans were $ 47.0 billion.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Mortgage Banking net income was $3 9 million, down from net income of $139 million in the prior year. Production revenue decreased, reflecting lower gain-on-sale margins on higher mortgage originations. Servicing income of $169 million was down from $283 million in the prior year. The results were primarily driven by lower MSR risk management results, partially offset by incr eased servicing revenue due to increased levels of third-party loans serviced. Noninterest expense was $324 million, up by $25 million, reflecting increased mortgage originations. During the quarter, the firm implemented SFAS 156, Accounting for Servicin g of Financial Assets and, effective January 1, 2006, the MSR asset was recorded on a fair value basis consistent with the associated derivative and other instruments. Highlights Include: § Mortgage loan originations of $28. 9 billion were up 8% from the pri or year and down 9% from the prior quarter. § Total third -party mortgage loans serviced were $ 484 billion, an increase of $49 billion, or 11% from the prior year.

Highlights Include: § Average loan receivables were $41.2 billion, down by $7.6 billion, or 16%, from the prior year and down by $1.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. § Average lease-related assets of $5.0 billion declined by $2.7 billion, or 35%. § The net charge-off rate was 0.46% compared with 0.60% in the prior year.

The deconsolidation of Paymentech has no impact on net income. Discussion of Results: Net income of $901 million was up by $379 million, or 73%, from the prior year. The results for the quarter reflected a pre -tax benefit of $550 million , which is based on an estimate by management of the impact of lower bankruptc ies following the new bankruptcy legislation that became effective in the fourth-quarter of 2005. Results were also driven by lower credit losses (excluding the impact from the bankruptcy legislation), merger savings and higher loan balances, including the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business. Th ese benefits were offset partially by narrower spreads on loans and higher marketing expense. Net revenue was $3.7 billion, down by $94 million, or 2%, from the prior year. After adjusting the prior-year results for the impact of the deconsolidation of Paymentech, revenue was up 1%. Net interest income was $3.0 billion , flat to the prior year . H igher loan balances, including the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business, and increased revenues due to the decline in bankruptcy-related revenue reversals, were offset by narrower loan spreads. Net interest income to average managed receivables was 8.85% down from 9.13% in the prior year, but up from 8.14% in the prior quarter. Noninterest revenue of $672 million was down by $100 million, or 13%. After adjusting the prior-year results for the impact of the deconsolidation of Paymentech, noninterest revenue was up 5% due to higher charge volume , resulting in increased interchange income, partially offset by higher volume -driven payments to partners and high er expense related to reward programs. Average managed loans of $138.0 billion increased by $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior year , but decreased $0.9 billion from the prior quarter. The current quarter included an average of $2.2 billion, and the prio r quarter included an average of $1.2 billion, of loans from the Sears Canada acquisition. End-of-period managed loans of $134.3 billion increased by $0.9 billion, or 1%, from the prior year (including $2.0 billion of loans from the Sears Canada acquisiti on) and decreased by $8.0 billion from the prior quarter. Th e decline from the prior quarter was caused by higher -than-normal customer payment rates , which management believes may be partially related to the recently implemented new minimum payment rules. The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, down by $620 million, or 38% , from the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower bankruptcy -related net charge-offs, which based on an estimate by management, had an impact of $475 million. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter decreased to 2.99%, down from 4.83% in the prior year and 6.39% in the prior quarter. The 30 -day managed delinquency rate was 3.10%, down from 3.54% in the prior year , and up from 2.79% in the prior quarter. These credit statistics reflect the impact of the new bankruptcy legislation. In addition , management believes the underlying credit quality of the managed loan portfolio remains strong. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion decreased by $70 million, or 5%. After adjusting the prior year’s results for the impact of the deconsolidation of Paymentech, expenses were up 5%. The increase was due to increased marketing activity, higher fraud -related losses and the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business, largely offset by merger savings. Highlights Include: § Agreement announced to acqui re Kohl’s private label portfolio with $1.5 billion of receivables and 13 million accounts. § Pre-tax income to averag e managed loans (ROO) was 4. 2%; excluding the pre-tax benefit, estimated by management to be $550 million, ROO would have been 2.6%. § Net interest income as a percentage of average managed loans was 8.85%, down from 9.13% in the prior year, and up from 8.14% in the prior quarter. § Average managed loans of $138.0 billion increased by $4.4 billion, or 3%, from the prior year but decreased $0.9 billion from the prior quarter.

Treasury was the primary driver of the improvement, with net interest income of negative $278 million compared with negative $409 million in the prior year. The benefit was due primarily to an improvement in Treasury’s net interest spread, offset partially by a reduction in the level of the available -for-sale securities portfolio. Noninterest revenue was $139 million compared with negative $86 million, reflecting lower Treasury securities portfolio losses of $158 million compared with losses of $902 million in the prior year. This increase was offset partially by lower Private Equity gains of $237 million compared with gains of $789 millio n in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $32 6 million, down $1.2 billion from $1.5 billion in the prior year. Excluding in the current quarter, $71 million of merger costs and incremental expense of $57 million from the adoption of SFAS 123R, and excluding in the prior year a material litigation charge of $900 million, primarily related to WorldCom, and $145 million of merger costs , noninterest expense would have been down $ 237 million. The decrease in expense was due to merger-related savings and other efficiencies. Highlights Include: § Private Equity portfolio was $6.3 billion, down from $7.2 billion in the prior year and up from $6.2 billion in the prior quarter. The portfolio represented 9.7% of stockholders’ equity less goodwill , down from 11. 6% in the prior year and unchanged from the prior quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The increase in earnings was driven by higher revenue, lower expenses and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Net re venue was $1 5.9 billion, up by $1.2 billion, or 8%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.2 billion was up by $1.5 billion, or 19%, primarily due to lower Treasury securities portfolio losses; increased trading revenue ; higher asset management , administration and commissions revenues and higher investment banking fees. Partially offsetting this growth were lower private e quity gains, the deconsolidation of Paymentech and lower Mortgage Banking production and servicing income . Net interest income was $ 6.7 billion, down by $313 million, or 4%, due to narrower spreads on wholesale loans, trading assets, consumer loans and consumer deposits. This decrease was offset partially by an improvement in Treasury’s net interest spread and in the spread on wholesale liabilities , as well as higher balances related to wholesale loans, consumer deposits and consumer loans. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, down by $64 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $ 179 million for the quarter compared with a benefit of $386 million in the prior year, primarily due to loan growth in the Investment Bank . The wholesale loan net recovery rate wa s 0.06% for the quarter , an improvement from a net recovery rate of 0.03% in the prior year. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, $629 million lower than the pri or year, primarily due to lower bankruptcy - related net charge-offs in Card Services. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $ 2.3 billion at March 31, 2006, down $601 million, or 20%, from the prior-year level of $2.9 billion. Noninterest e xpense w as $ 9.8 billion, down by $185 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Excluding in the current year, incremental expense of $459 million from the adoption of SFAS 123R and $71 million of merger costs , and excluding in the prior year, a material litigation charge of $900 million, primarily related to WorldCom, and $145 million of merger costs , noninterest expense would have been up $330 million. The increase was driven by a higher performance-based compensation offset partially by improved operating efficiencies. Highlights Include: § Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.5% at March 31 , 2006 (estimated) , 8. 5% at December 31, 2005, and 8.6% at March 31, 2005. § During the quarter, $ 1.3 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 31.8 million shares purchased at an average price of $40.54 per share. § On March 21, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program, which replaced the previous $6 billion authorization. As of March 31, 2006, a total of $143 million had been repurchased under the share repurchase program. § Headcount of 170,787 increased by 1,940 since December 31, 2005. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Merger and other financial information • Merger savings and cost: For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, approximately $ 580 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualized rate of $ 2.3 billion. Management continues to estimate annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion. Management estimates that annualized savings will be $2.8 billion by the end of 2006. Merger costs of $71 million were expensed during the first quarter of 2006, bringing the total amount expensed to $2.2 billion since the merger announcement. Management continues to estimate remaining merger costs of $800 million to $1.3 billion, which are expected to be expensed during the remainder of 2006 and 2007. • FASB Statement No. 123R (“Share -Based Payment”): JPMorgan Chase adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), (“Share -Based Payment”) as of January 1, 2006 under the modified prospectiv e method. SFAS 123R requires that stock compensation granted to retirement -eligible employees be fully expensed at, or prior to, the time of grant rather than amortized over the vesting period. Accordingly, as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R this q uarter, the firm expensed the full amount of the compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock made in January 2006 to retirement -eligible employees. In addition, during the first quarter of 2006, the firm began to accrue the estimated c ost of grants expected to be awarded in January 2007 to retirement -eligible employees. Awards granted to retirement -eligible employees prior to January 1, 2006 have not been accelerated and will continue to be amortized over the original vesting periods. The chart below provides, for each business segment, the incremental expense for the first quarter of 2006 and the estimated incremental expense for the remaining quarters of 2006, related to the adoption of SFAS 123R. The amounts set forth below are non -cash charges and represent accelerated recognition of costs that would have been incurred in future periods. Incremental Expense 1Q06 Estimated Incremental Expense per Quarter 2Q06 – 4Q06 Investment Bank $256 $70 RFS 17 5 Card Services 4 0 Commercial Banking 29 5 TSS 25 5 AWM 71 15 Corporate 57 10 Total $459 $110 Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business results on a managed basis, which is a non -GAAP financia l measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results. Effective January 1, 2006, the firm made certain modifications to its financial disclosures. These changes are described in a Current Report on Form 8 -K, furnished on April 11, 2006, to which reference is hereby made. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2006, managed basis includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net r evenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge -offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will affect both the loan receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed loan receiva bles, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge -off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenu e and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax - equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax -exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax exp ense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (first quarter 2006) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pre-tax margin represents net income before income taxes divided b y total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre -tax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates the performance of TSS and AWM against that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
