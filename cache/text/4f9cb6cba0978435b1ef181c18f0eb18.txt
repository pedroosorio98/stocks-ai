Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 10 Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC. Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those placed in service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion and an increase in net income of $761 million and $2.3 billion, or $0.06 and $0.18 per basic and $0.06 and $0.18 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 11 Note 2.

Revenue Backlog As of September 30, 2023 , we had $64.9 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenu e currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.3 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 12 Note 3. Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. As of September 30, 2023 , the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $28.8 billion , of which $10.4 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and primarily classified as Level 2.

Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities Gains and losses (including impairments), net, for marketable and non-marketable equity securities included in OI&E are summarized below (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2023 2022 2023 Realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ (73) $ 42 $ (355) $ 348 Unrealized net gain (loss) on marketable equity securities (86) (224) (2,494) 136 Unrealized net gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities(1) (488) (184) 881 (678) Total gain (loss) on equity securities in other income (expense), net $ (647) $ (366) $ (1,968) $ (194) (1) Unrealized gain (loss) on non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative is comprised of $219 million and $599 million of upward adjustments and $707 million and $783 million of downward adjustments (including impairments) for three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and $3.2 billion and $1.6 billion of upward adjustments and $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion of downward adjustments (including impairments) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&E, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of September 30, 2023 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $691 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E. Other Derivatives We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other derivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details.

Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIE) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. Total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both periods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for an y period presented and is included within the "other" component of OI&E. See Note 6 for further details on OI&E. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.5 billion and $3.8 billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2023 . The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments. Note 5. Debt Short-Term Debt We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 21 Long-Term Debt Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages): Maturity Coupon Rate Effective Interest Rate As of December 31, 2022 As of September 30, 2023 Debt 2014-2020 Notes issuances 2024 - 2060 0.45% - 3.38% 0.57% - 3.38% $ 13,000 $ 13,000 Future finance lease payments, net and other (1) 2,142 2,314 Total debt 15,142 15,314 Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (143) (133) Less: Current portion of long-term notes(2) 0 (1,000) Less: Current portion of future finance lease payments, net and other current debt(1)(2) (298) (400) Total long-term debt $ 14,701 $ 13,781 (1) Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest. (2) Total current portion of long-term debt is included within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. See Note 6 for further details. The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually. The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $9.9 billion and $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit Facility As of September 30, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities of which $4.0 billion expires in April 2024 and $6.0 billion expires in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. Note 6.

Note 7. Workforce Reduction and Other Initiatives We have a company-wide effort underway to re-engineer our cost base. As part of this program, in January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce. As a result, total employee severance and related charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $86 million and $2.1 billion , respectively. Substantially all of the employees affected were no longer included in our headcount as of September 30, 2023. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, were $16 million and $649 million, respectively, as reflected in the table below. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation, which are n ot included in the table below. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 24 Severance and office space exit charges are included within our consolidated statements of income as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Severance and Related (1) Office Space Total Severance and Related (1) Office Space Total Cost of revenues $ 17 $ 6 $ 23 $ 477 $ 246 $ 723 Research and development 15 7 22 847 268 1,115 Sales and marketing 50 1 51 494 59 553 General and administrative 4 2 6 263 76 339 Total charges $ 86 $ 16 $ 102 $ 2,081 $ 649 $ 2,730 (1) Severance includes amounts to be settled in cash, accounted for as one-time involuntary employee termination benefits, and stock based compensation.

Expected amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets held as of September 30, 2023 was as follows (in millions): Remainder of 2023 $ 118 2024 466 2025 335 2026 257 2027 174 Thereafter 249 Total $ 1,599 Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $11.1 billion as of September 30, 2023, of which the majority is paid over seven years ending in the first quarter of 2030. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of September 30, 2023 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 26 Legal Matters We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Antitrust Investigations On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022. On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022. On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ( $1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example: • In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial commenced on September 12, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices. • On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint . The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 27 business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO by December 31, 2023. • On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations. On October 6, 2023, the Korea Communications Commission issued a preliminary decision that we are not in full compliance with the new regulations. We intend to respond in November 2023. We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vig orously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Other We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect. Non-Income Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 28 and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13. Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Share Repurchases In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we repurchased $15.9 billion and $46.2 billion , respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares. In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2023, $52.3 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Shares Amount Shares Amount Class A share repurchases 14 $ 1,805 51 $ 5,724 Class C share repurchases 108 14,113 359 40,432 Total share repurchases(1) 122 $ 15,918 410 $ 46,156 (1) Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of September 30, 2023. Class A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 29 Note 11.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, total SBC expense was $14.4 billion and $16.5 billion , including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $13.8 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , total SBC expense includes $429 million associated with workforce reduction costs. See Note 7 for further information.

This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. Note 13. Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except for effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2023 2022 2023 Income before provision for income taxes $ 16,233 $ 21,197 $ 54,181 $ 61,305 Provision for income taxes $ 2,323 $ 1,508 $ 7,833 $ 8,197 Effective tax rate 14.3 % 7.1 % 14.5 % 13.4 % We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, of which $5.3 billion and $6.8 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. Note 14. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: • Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. • Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. • Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue. Reflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. As announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included within Google Services. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors." Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted in "Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; • general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; • new product and service launches; and • seasonality. Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising ("Google advertising"), revenues from other sources ("Google other revenues"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues. Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: • Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; • YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and • Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 34 Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as: • advertiser competition for keywords; • changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; • changes in device mix; • seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and • traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels. Google Other Google other revenues are comprised of the following: • Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases; • hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices; • YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV; and • other products and services. Fluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following: • Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; • Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and • other enterprise services. Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage. Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 35 Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. • TAC includes: ◦ Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. ◦ Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. • Other cost of revenues includes: ◦ Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). ◦ Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). ◦ Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell. TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: • compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; • depreciation; and • third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: • compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and • spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: • compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; • expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and • third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 36 the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. For additional details, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as well as Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Executive Overview The following table summarizes our consolidated financial results (in millions, except per share information and percentages): Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 2023 $ Change % Change Consolidated revenues $ 69,092 $ 76,693 $ 7,601 11 % Change in consolidated constant currency revenues(1) 11 % Cost of revenues $ 31,158 $ 33,229 $ 2,071 7 % Operating expenses $ 20,799 $ 22,121 $ 1,322 6 % Operating income $ 17,135 $ 21,343 $ 4,208 25 % Operating margin 25 % 28 % 3 % Other income (expense), net $ (902) $ (146) $ 756 (84) % Net Income $ 13,910 $ 19,689 $ 5,779 42 % Diluted EPS $ 1.06 $ 1.55 $ 0.49 46 % (1) See "Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Measures" below for details relating to our use of constant currency information. • Revenues were $76.7 billion, an increase of 11% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services revenues of $6.6 billion, or 11%, and an increase in Google Cloud revenues of $1.5 billion, or 22%. • Total constant currency revenues, which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 11% year over year. • Cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, an increase of 7% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in content acquisition costs and TAC. An overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. • Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses largely due to an increase in stock-based compensation , and charges related to legal matters, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional activities. Additionally, operating expenses benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment. Other Information • In Janu ary 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result we recorded employee severance and related charges of $86 million and $2.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result, exit charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $16 million and $649 million, respectively. In addition to these exit charges, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and accelerated depreciation. We may Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 37 incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs . For additional information, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. • In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. The effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $977 million and $2.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, recognized primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. • On July 21, 2023, the IRS announced a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to U.S. federal foreign tax credits . This announcement only applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to prior periods for this tax rule change was recorded in the third quarter of 2023 and resulted in our effective tax rate of 7.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and 13.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. • Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. • Operating cash flow was $30.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , which reflects the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to tax payers headquartered in designated counties in California. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income tax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion that will be reflected in our fourth quarter operating cash flow. • Capital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $8.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. • As of September 30, 2023, we had 182,381 employees. Substantially all of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce were no longer included in our headcount as of September 30, 2023.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements ("FX Effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 42 Costs and Expenses Cost of Revenues The following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2022 2023 2022 2023 TAC $ 11,826 $ 12,642 $ 36,030 $ 36,900 Other cost of revenues 19,332 20,587 54,831 58,857 Total cost of revenues $ 31,158 $ 33,229 $ 90,861 $ 95,757 Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 45 % 43 % 44 % 43 % Cost of revenues increased $2.1 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.3 billion and $816 million, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $4.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $4.0 billion and $870 million, respectively. The increase in TAC from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.7% to 21.2% from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and decreased from 21.8% to 21.4% from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube . In addition, a n overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment.

This announcement only applies to foreign taxes paid or accrued in our fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Additionally, on September 8, 2023, the IRS issued a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses. A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable to prior periods for these tax rule changes was recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended September 30, 2022 to the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.

Financial Condition Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of September 30, 2023 , we had $119.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 67,881 $ 82,831 Net cash used in investing activities $ (14,071) $ (20,896) Net cash used in financing activities $ (52,128) $ (52,785) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 46 Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increase in cash received from customers and the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California , partially offset by increased cash payments for costs and expenses. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income tax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion that will be reflected in our fourth quarter operating cash flow. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of an increase in net purchases of and maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in payments for acquisitions and intangible assets. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt. Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock partially offset by a decrease in net payments related to debt. Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: • technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and • office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs"). Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, we spent $23.9 billion and $21.2 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $11.2 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively. Leases Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 47 For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 , the amount of total future l ease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.2 years, was $17.9 billion . As of September 30, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $3.5 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms o f 1 to 25 years. As of September 30, 2023, our actions to optimize our office space did not affect our operating lease obligations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion , respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2023. Financing We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2023 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of September 30, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities. As of September 30, 2023 , we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our debt. We primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and hardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. Certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Share Repurchase Program During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we repurchased and subsequently retired 122 million and 410 million shares for $15.9 billion and $46.2 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended September 30, 2023, 14 million shares were Class A stock for $1.8 billion and 108 million shares were Class C stock for $14.1 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , 51 million shares were Class A stock for $5.7 billion and 359 million shares were Class C stock for $40.4 billion. In April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2023, $52.3 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted on August 16, 2022 and requires a one percent excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this provision to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017 ), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 ), and €1.5 billion ( $1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019 ), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For further details, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 48 Taxes As of September 30, 2023 , we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $3.6 billion and $2.1 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax C uts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have long-term taxes payable of $5.9 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023. As a result of the 2023 IRS payment deferral relief made available to taxpayers headquartered in designated counties in California, we postponed our second and third quarter U.S. federal income tax pay ments. On October 16, 2023, we made an estimated income tax payment to the IRS of $10.5 billion. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Purchase Commitments As of September 30, 2023, we had material contractual obliga tions of $44.3 billion, of which $29.4 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity . For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30, 2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.
