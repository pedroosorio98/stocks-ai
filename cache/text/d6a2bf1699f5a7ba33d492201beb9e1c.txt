The primary purpose of the amendment was to separate the role of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the role of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. As previously reported on a Form&#160;8-K dated May&#160;3, 2025, on May&#160;4, 2025, the Board voted unanimously to appoint Mr.&#160;Greg Abel to become the Company&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer effective January&#160;1, 2026. Mr.&#160;Abel will replace Mr.&#160;Warren Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s current Chief Executive Officer on that date. Mr.&#160;Buffett will continue to be Chairman of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. As a result of the upcoming change whereby the Company&#8217;s Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer will no longer be positions held by the same person, a new Paragraph 3.5 was added to Section&#160;3 &#8211; Board of Directors of the Company&#8217;s By-Laws and various changes were made to Section&#160;4 &#8211; Officers and Agents of the Company&#8217;s By-Laws.
