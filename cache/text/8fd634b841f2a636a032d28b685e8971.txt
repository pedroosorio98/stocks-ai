(&quot; Nu &quot; or the &quot; Company &quot;) hereby informs its shareholders and the market, and in consideration of the new prudential rules for payment institutions issued by the Brazilian Central Bank of Brazil (&quot; BCB &quot;) last March 11th, 2022, the following: &nbsp; 1. we have a strong capital position that is adequate to the requirements of the new regulatory framework. Given that the capital requirement has never been considered a competitive advantage, this change does not have a significant impact on our business model or our ability to grow. 2. the phased implementation schedule of the capital requirement has been extended as compared to the proposal presented in Public Consultation Notice No. 78, dated November 2020 ("ECP 78"), resulting in a lower capital requirement in 2023 and 2024 than our original expectations based on the ECP 78. 3. our preliminary estimates indicate, at the end of the implementation of the new standards in January 2025, a conglomerate-wide capital requirement between 10 to 15% higher than the level originally anticipated in ECP 78. 4. these estimates foresee an increase in the capital requirements applicable to our credit card business (bringing them in line with Basel III guidelines), but keeping the capital requirements for our other businesses nearly unchanged. 5. a more detailed evaluation of the effects of the new regulatory framework depends on the edition of other rules by the BCB, such as the object of the Public Consultation Notice ECP No. 80, on the calculation of the capital requirement of exposures to credit risk. &nbsp; We will continue to monitor the new rules from BCB and will keep the market informed of any new developments. &nbsp; &nbsp; Contacts: Investor Contact: Guilherme Lago investors@nubank.com.br &nbsp; Media Contact: Leila Suwwan press@nubank.com.br &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By:&nbsp; /s/ Guilherme Lago &nbsp; &nbsp; Guilherme Lago Chief Financial Officer &nbsp; Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;March 14, 2022 &nbsp;
