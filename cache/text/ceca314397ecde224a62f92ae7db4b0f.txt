Meanwhile, we saw increased activity in the Markets business. Markets revenue rose to $9.7 billion, an exceptionally strong quarter with record revenue in Equities. In CCB, the franchise continued to acquire new customers at a robust pace, opening 500,000 net new checking accounts and adding record first-time investors in wealth management. Finally, AWM had healthy AUM net inflows of $90 billion, and investment performance remained strong.” Dimon added: “This quarter, we repurchased $7 billion of common stock and announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. The increase in capital return was supported by our strong earnings generation and elevated capital levels. That being said, we continue to believe it is prudent to maintain excess capital and ample liquidity in this environment – our CET1 ratio remained very strong at 15.4%, and we have an extraordinary amount of liquidity, with $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities.” Dimon added: “The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and “trade wars,” ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.” Dimon concluded: “We remain committed to serving our clients and communities, which include consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries, across all environments. And our fortress balance sheet enables the Firm to be a pillar of strength, particularly during volatile or challenging times.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN 1Q25 RESULTS n $588 million First Republic-related gain11 in Corporate ($0.16 increase in EPS12) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.9 billion or $1.40 per share n $7.1 billion of common stock net repurchases13 n Net payout LTM13,14 of 62% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $119.24, up 12% YoY; tangible book value per share2 of $100.36, up 13% YoY n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $280 billion, Standardized ratio3 of 15.4% and Advanced ratio3 of 15.5% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n Approximately $840 billion of credit and capital15 raised in 1Q25: n $60 billion of credit for consumers n $10 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $760 billion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $10 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons are for the first quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue was $46.0 billion, up 8%. Net interest income was $23.4 billion, up 1%. Noninterest revenue was $22.6 billion, up 17%. Net interest income excluding Markets 2 was $22.6 billion, down 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. These were predominantly offset by higher revolving balances in Card Services, the impact of securities activity including activity in prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposit balances. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets 2 was $13.8 billion, up 20%. Excluding the $588 million First Republic-related gain 11, noninterest revenue excluding Markets2 was up 14%, largely driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, lower net investment securities losses compared to the prior year and higher investment banking fees. Markets revenue was $9.7 billion, up 21%, primarily driven by higher Equity Markets revenue. Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up 4%, driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in front office and technology employees. The increase was also driven by higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, higher marketing expense and the absence of a legal benefit from the prior year. These increases were largely offset by the impact of a FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323 million compared with an increase of $725 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $ 3.3 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.3 billion, up $376 million, predominantly driven by Card Services. T he net reserve build of $973 million included $549 million in Wholesale and $441 million in Consume r and was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year- to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $119.24, $116.07 and $ 106.81 at March 31, 2025 , December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
