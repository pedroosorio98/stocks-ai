We registered record revenues and are making huge strides towards becoming a multi-product and multi-country platform. Our largest operation -Brazil- is now profitable, having registered a net profit of US$ 13 million in the first half of 2022, driven by customer growth to 65 million and ability to offer and cross-sell new products. We are the fourth largest card player in Brazil, almost a quarter of all PIX operations pass through Nu's accounts, and we are a leader in the digital-direct investment space with 5 million active customers. We are diversifying and scaling with Crypto, Insurance, SME and Personal Loans. Moving internationally, we are now the #1 issuer of new credit cards in both Mexico and Colombia &#8211;where we have just received a license approval to continue our expansion&#8221;, said David V&eacute;lez, founder and CEO. Q2&#8217;22 Results Snapshot Below are Q2&#8217;22 performance highlights of Nu Holdings Ltd.: &nbsp; Operating Highlights: &#9679; Customer growth : Nu added 5.7 million customers in the quarter reaching a total of 65.3 million customers in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.
