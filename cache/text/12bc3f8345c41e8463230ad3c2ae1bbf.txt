S&atilde;o Paulo, December 3, 2025 &ndash; Nubank, one of the world's largest digital financial services platforms, announces its intention to obtain a banking license in Brazil. The inclusion of a banking institution within the conglomerate complies with the provisions of Joint Resolution No. 17, issued by the Central Bank and the National Monetary Council, which standardizes brand name usage for regulated institutions. With this decision, the Nubank brand and visual identity will remain unchanged. This announcement will have no impact on clients, and all operations shall proceed normally. Nubank has more than 110 million customers in Brazil. "Nubank was founded 12 years ago and has been responsible for the inclusion of 28 million individuals in the financial system. Our identity and mission to simplify our customers&rsquo; lives will remain the same," states Livia Chanes, CEO of Nubank in Brazil. Currently, Nubank fully complies with all applicable regulations, and operates with all necessary licenses as a Payment Institution, a Credit, Financing, and Investment Company (Sociedade de Cr&eacute;dito, Financiamento e Investimento), and a Securities Brokerage Company (Sociedade Corretora de T&iacute;tulos e Valores Mobili&aacute;rios). The inclusion of a banking institution within the conglomerate does not materially alter additional capital and liquidity requirements&mdash;the financial solidity and resilience remain unaltered.
