In the CIB, investment banking fees grew 31%, while Markets revenue was resilient, rising 8%. Payments fees grew by double-digits as investments are fueling organic growth. In CCB, we ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits for the fourth consecutive year. Card loans increased 11%, and we saw robust acquisition of 2.5 million accounts. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees rose 15%, and long-term net inflows were a record $72 billion.” Dimon added: “We await our regulators’ new rules on the Basel III endgame and the G-SIB surcharge as well as any adjustments to the SCB or CCAR. We believe rules can be written that promote a strong financial system without causing undue consequences for the economy, and now is an excellent time to step back and review the extensive set of existing rules – which were put in place for a good reason – to understand their impact on economic growth, the viability of both public and private markets, and secondary market liquidity. Regardless of the outcome of these rules, we have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, evidenced by total loss-absorbing capacity of $544 billion plus cash and marketable securities of $1.5 trillion, while our riskiest assets, loans, total $1.3 trillion. On share repurchases, given that market levels are at least slightly inflated, we maintain our modest pace of buybacks, although we reserve the right to adjust this at any time.” Dimon added: “We have been closely monitoring the geopolitical situation for some time, and recent events show that conditions are treacherous and getting worse. There is significant human suffering, and the outcome of these situations could have far-reaching effects on both short-term economic outcomes and more importantly on the course of history. Additionally, while inflation is slowing and the U.S. economy remains resilient, several critical issues remain, including large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. While we hope for the best, these events and the prevailing uncertainty demonstrate why we must be prepared for any environment.” Dimon concluded: “I get to travel around the country and the globe for our Firm. It gives me immense pride to see our employees tirelessly serve their clients and communities, which include over 82 million U.S. consumers and 6 million small businesses, 40 thousand large and medium-sized businesses – who we bank wherever they do business – and thousands of institutional clients, as well as veterans, schools, cities, states and countries around the world. I know you join me in extending gratitude to our employees.” CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.6 billion or $1.25 per share n $6.0 billion of common stock net repurchases12 n Net payout LTM12,13 of 54% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $115.15, up 15%; tangible book value per share2 of $96.42, up 18% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $273 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 15.3%; Advanced ratio3 of 15.5% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n Over $2 trillion of credit and capital14 raised YTD, reflecting approximately n $185 billion of credit for consumers n $30 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $1.9 trillion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $50 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the third quarter of 2024 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $115.15, $111.29 and $100.30 at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
