Our increased scale and diversity is already proving very resilient, with strong product cycles in our now largest segment, wired, offsetting weaker demand in our enterprise storage and wireless segments,” said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Limited . “We are expecting a robust third quarter, led by strong growth in wireless revenue, and continued strength in wired networking, and remain confident in our ability to leverage earnings growth as we work towards full integration and achievement of our operating model.” Other Quarterly Data &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GAAP &nbsp; &nbsp;Reconciling Items&nbsp; &nbsp; Non-GAAP &nbsp; Net revenue &nbsp; &nbsp;$3,740M +/- $75M&nbsp; &nbsp; $10M &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Non-GAAP net revenue includes $10 million of licensing revenue not included in GAAP revenue, as a result of the effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions; Non-GAAP gross margin includes the effects of $10 million of licensing revenue, and excludes the effects of $356 million of inventory step-up charges to record BRCM inventory at fair value, as part of the purchase accounting for the Acquisition, $210 million of amortization of intangible assets, $15 million of share-based compensation expense, and $8 million of restructuring charges; Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude $732 million of amortization of intangible assets, $206 million of share-based compensation expense, $36 million of restructuring charges, and $29 million of acquisition-related costs; Non-GAAP interest and other excludes $20 million of losses on extinguishment of long-term debt; Non-GAAP tax provision excludes $147 million tax benefit representing the tax effects of the reconciling items noted above; and Non-GAAP diluted share count excludes the impact of share-based compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

For the third fiscal quarter, depreciation is expected to be $106 million and amortization is expected to be approximately $942 million . The guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release. Among other things, this guidance is based on an initial estimate of purchase accounting adjustments and allocations, all of which are subject to revision. The guidance also excludes the impact of any additional mergers, acquisitions and divestiture activity that may occur during the quarter. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Interim Dividend The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a quarterly, interim cash dividend of $0.50 per ordinary share. A corresponding distribution will also be paid by the Partnership, of which the Company is the General Partner, to holders of REUs, in the amount of $0.50 per REU. The dividend and the distribution are both payable on June 30, 2016 to shareholders or unitholders of record, as applicable, at the close of business ( 5:00 p.m.) Eastern Time on June 17, 2016 .

Those wishing to access the call should dial (866) 310-8712; International +1 (720) 634-2946. The passcode is 6177961. A replay of the call will be accessible for one week after the call.

A webcast of the conference call will also be available in the “Investors” section of Broadcom’s website at www.broadcom.com .&nbsp; Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net revenue, net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenues, and excludes amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, write-off of debt issuance costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, income (loss) from and gain (loss) on discontinued operations and income tax effects of non-GAAP reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. However, internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company’s operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company’s competitors. The presentation of these and other similar items in Broadcom’s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Broadcom believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company’s on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company’s on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) For the fiscal quarter and two fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2016, basic loss per share numerators are reduced by the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, which is 5.5% of net loss incurred subsequent to January 31, 2016. The noncontrolling interest is related to the restricted exchangeable partnership units of Broadcom Cayman L.P. (“Partnership REUs”), of which Broadcom Limited is the General Partner.&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) For the fiscal quarter and two fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2016, diluted loss per share numerators and denominators include the impact of the noncontrolling interest, which assumes conversion of Partnership REUs to Broadcom ordinary shares. The diluted loss per share calculations include 23 million and 11 million Partnership REUs for the fiscal quarter and two fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2016, respectively, representing an assumed conversion of 100% of the Partnership REUs under the “if converted” method.&nbsp;
