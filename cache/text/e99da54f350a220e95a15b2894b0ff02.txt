(NYSE: JPM) today reported fourth- quarter 2009 net income of $3.3 billion, compared with net income of $702 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.74, compared with $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, net income was $11.7 billion, or $2.26 per share, up from $5.6 billion, or $1.35 per share, in 2008. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: “We are gratified that we generated earnings of $3.3 billion for the f ourth quarter and nearly $12 billion for the year. Though these results showed improvement, we ac knowledge that they fe ll short of both an adequate return on capital and the firm’s earnings potential. We benefited from the diversity of our leading franchises, as demonstrated by the conti nued earnings strength of our Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, Asset Manage ment and Retail Banking fr anchises. We are proud that, throughout these tumultuous times, we never stopped investing in the fundame ntal growth drivers of our consumer businesses – such as checking a nd credit card accounts in our Retail Banking and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Card Services franchises – and have developed new products and services to meet the needs of consumers and small businesses. While we are s eeing some stability in delinquencies, consumer credit costs remain high, and weak employment and home prices persist. Accordingly, we remain cautious.” Commenting on the firm’s balance sheet, Dimon added: “In the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our credit reserves to nearly $33 bil lion, or 5.5% of total loans. Our earnings generated additional capital, and we ended 2009 w ith a very strong Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.1% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 8.8%. We remain confident that this capital and reserve strength, combined with our significant earnings power, will allow us to meet the uncertainties that lie ahead and still continue inves ting in our businesses and serving our clients a nd shareholders over the long term.” Dimon further remarked: “We remain committed to helping homeowners meet the challenges of declining home prices and rising unemployment. Since 2007, we have initiated more than 900,000 actions to prevent foreclosures through our own programs and through government mortgage modification programs. During 2009 alone we offered approximately 600,000 new trial loan modifications to struggling homeowners. Of these, 89,000 loans have achieved permanent modification. By March 31, 2010, we will have opened 51 Chase Homeownership Centers across the country, and we already have more than 14,000 employees dedicated to mortgage loss mitigation.” Reflecting on the events of the previous year, Dimon conclude d: “Throughout this period of financial turbulence, our employees have never lost focus on what a bank should do – support and serve our 90 million customers and the communities in which we operate; deliver consumer- friendly products and policies; and continue to lend. We extended nearly $250 billion in new credit to consumers during the year, and for our corporate and municipal clients, e ither lent or assisted them in raising approximately $1 trillion in loans, stocks or bonds. Lastly, I am very proud of our more than 200,000 employees around the world, from our programmers to our receptionists to our bankers. Through their tremendous efforts, we have been able to protect our company and keep it healthy and vibrant, while doing our part to sup port the global financial system and helping the countries where we do business.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

These results reflected significantly higher net revenue, a benefit from the provision for credit losses, and lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $4.9 billion, compared with nega tive $272 million in the prior year. Investment banking fees were up 38% to $1.9 billion, consisti ng of debt underwriting fees of $732 million (up 58%), advisory fees of $611 million (up 6%), a nd equity underwriting fees of $549 million (up 66%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $2.7 billion, compared with negative $1.7 billion in the prior year, reflecting modest ga ins on legacy leveraged lending a nd mortgage-related positions, compared with markdowns of $2.9 billion in the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue declined from a record 2009 third quarter, primar ily due to lower overall volumes and tighter spreads across products. Equity Markets revenu e was $971 million, compared with negative $94 million in the prior year, reflecting solid client revenue across products and strong trading results. Credit Portfolio revenue was negative $669 million, reflecting the negative impact of credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets and liabilities, and ma rk-to-market losses on hedges of retained loans, partially offset by net interest income on loans. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $181 million, compared with an expense of $765 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected lower loan balances, driven by loan sales and repayments. The allowance for lo an losses to end-of-period loans retained was 8.25%, compared with 4.83% in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $685 million, compared with $87 million in the prior year. N onperforming loans were $3.5 billion, up by $2.3 billion from the prior year and down by $1.4 billion from the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $2.3 billion, down by $455 million, or 17%, from the prior year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and headcount-related 1 expense.

Net revenue was $7.7 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billi on, or 12%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $5.1 billion, up by $360 million, or 8%, reflecting the impact of wider loan spreads and a shift to wider-spread deposit products, partia lly offset by lower loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.6 billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 35%, driven by lower MSR risk management results and an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans. The provision for credit losses was $4.2 billion, an increase of $653 million from the prior year and $241 million from the prior quarter. Weak economic conditions and housing price declines continued to drive higher estimated losses for the mortgage and home equity portfolios. The provision included an addition of $1.5 billion to the allowance for loan losses, compared with additions of $1.9 billion in the pr ior year and $1.4 billi on in the prior quarter . Included in the $1.5 billion addition to the allowance was a $491 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to estimated deterioration in the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired portfolio; this compared with no addition in the prior year and a $1.1 billion addition in the prior quarter related to the portfolio. Home equity net charge-offs were $1.2 billion (4. 52% net charge-off rate 1), compared with $770 million (2.67% net charge-off rate 1) in the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $4.3 billion, an increase of $256 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Retail Banking reported net income of $1.0 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year. Net revenue was $4.5 billion, flat compared with the prior year, as an increase in net interest income was offset by a decrease in noninterest re venue. Net interest income benefited from a shift to wider-spread deposit products, largely offset by a decline in time deposit balances. The decrease in noninterest revenue was driven by declining deposit-related fees and investment sales revenue, predominantly offset by an increase in debit card income. The provision for credit losses was $248 million, co mpared with $268 million in the prior year, reflecting continued weakness in the Business Banking portfolio. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up by $41 m illion, or 2%, reflecting increased FDIC insurance premiums and headcount-related 1 expense, offset by effici encies resulting from the Washington Mutual transaction. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Checking accounts totaled 25.7 million, up 5% from the prior year and 1% from the prior quarter.  Average total deposits were $329.8 billi on, down 3% from both the prior year and prior quarter due to the maturity of time deposits acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction.  Deposit margin was 3.06%, compared with 2.94% in the prior year and 2.99% in the prior quarter.  Average Business Banking and other lo ans were $17.2 billion, down 5% from the prior year and 3% from the prior quarter, while origin ations were $670 million, down 13% from the prior year and up 40% from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of credit cards decreased 31% from the prior year and 6% from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of investment products increased 48% from the prior year, partially driven by significantly increas ed sales in the Washington Mutual footprint, and declined 6% from the prior quarter.  Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit in tangibles) was 55%, compared with 54% in the prior year and 56% in the prior quarter.  Number of branches was 5,154, down 6% from the prior year and up 1% from the prior quarter. Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss of $416 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue, a higher pr ovision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $3.1 billion, down by $1.0 billion, or 24%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower mortgage fees and related income and lower loan balances, partially offset by wider loan spreads. Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to lower mortgage production revenue and lower net mortgage servicing revenue. Mortgage production revenue was negative $192 million, compared with positive $62 million in the prior year, as an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previo usly-sold loans was largely offset by wider margins on new originations and the absence of markdowns of the mortgage warehouse in the prior y ear. Operating revenue, which represents loan servicing re venue net of other changes in fa ir value of the MSR asset, was $564 million, up by $41 million. MSR risk management results were $109 million, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, co mpared with $3.3 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP bas is was $23,164 million, $26,622 million and $17,226 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, third quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2008, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $3.3 billion, an increase of $2.6 b illion from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Managed net revenue was $25.2 billion, an increase of $6.1 billion, or 32%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up by $7.6 billion. The increase was driven by significantly higher principal transactions revenue and higher investment banking fees, partially offset by lower MSR risk management results and the absence of a gain from the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech joint venture in th e fourth quarter of 2008. Net inte rest income was $14.4 billion, down by $1.4 billion, or 9%, driven by lower tradi ng-related net interest income, lower loan balances and spread compression on liability a nd deposit products, predominantly offset by wider loan spreads and higher investment portfolio net interest income. The managed provision for credit losses was $8 .9 billion, up by $360 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 5.51%, compared with 3.62% in the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion, compared with $7.4 billion in the prior y ear, reflecting higher net charge- offs across most consumer portfolios, partially offset by a lower addition to the allowance for credit losses primarily relating to Card Servi ces. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $6.6 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in the prio r year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates 1 of 6.05% and 3.62%, respectively. The wholesale pr ovision for credit losses was $421 million, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting releases in the allowance for loan losses in the current quarter due to loan sales and repaym ents offset by higher charge-offs. Wholesale net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, compared with ne t charge-offs of $217 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 2.31% and 0.3 3%, respectively, reflecting continued weakening in the credit environment. The firm’s nonperfor ming assets totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $12.7 billion. Noninterest expense was $12.0 billion, up by $749 m illion, or 7%, reflecting higher performance- based compensation, servicing and default-related expense and FDIC insurance premiums, largely offset by efficiencies resulting from the Wash ington Mutual transaction and lower headcount- related 1 expense.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, wh ich is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments. First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for cr edit losses, net charge-offs a nd loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with U.S. GAAP remain on the balance sheet, a nd that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations ar e funded and decisions are made about al locating resources, such as employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In add ition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on th e balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both th e credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Ac cordingly, revenue from tax-exempt s ecurities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basi s comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to asse ss the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The co rresponding income tax impact related to th ese items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financ ial Supplement for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. b. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes purchased credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm’s balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge-off rates exclude the impact of purchased credit-impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses applicable to these loans wa s $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009. There was no allowance for loan losses recorded for these loans at December 31, 2008. c. Tier 1 Common Capital (“Tier 1 Common ”) is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of capital not in the form of common equity – such as qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other noncompensation costs related to employees. e. TSS firmwide revenue includes ce rtain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business, mainly CB, RFS and AM, related to customers who are also customers of those lines of business. f. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (b) For further discussion of managed basis, see Note 1.a on page 13. (d) The calculation of full year 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. (e) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (f) The calculation of full year 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction, the adjusted ROE for the full year 2009 was 7% and the adjusted ROTCE was 11%, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, both non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because they increase the comparability to prior periods. (g) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to assess the Firm's use of equity. (h) Tier 1 common is calculated as Tier 1 capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. The Firm uses the Tier 1 common capital ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. (i) Estimated. 4Q09 Change (c) Effective January 1, 2009, the Firm implemented new FASB guidance for participating securities. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised as required.
