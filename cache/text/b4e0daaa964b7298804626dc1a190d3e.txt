As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, our actions are critical to keep the global economy going - from processing $6 trillion in payments each day worldwide to keeping three-quarters of our nearly 5,000 branches open - and safe - to meet individuals’ financial needs. During these unprecedented times, JPMorgan Chase remains resilient and steadfast in using all of our resources to support our colleagues, clients and communities across the globe.” Dimon added: “Despite some recent positive macroeconomic data and significant, decisive government action, we still face much uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy. However, we are prepared for all eventualities as our fortress balance sheet allows us to remain a port in the storm. We ended the quarter with massive loss- absorbing capacity - over $34 billion of credit reserves and total liquidity resources of $1.5 trillion, on top of $191 billion of CET1 capital, with significant earnings power that would allow us to absorb even more credit reserves if needed. This is why we can continue to serve all of our stakeholders and to pay our dividend - unless the economic situation deteriorates materially and significantly.” Dimon commented on the results: “We earned $4.7 billion of net income in the second quarter despite building $8.9 billion of credit reserves because we generated our highest quarterly revenue ever, which demonstrates the benefit of our diversified global business model. Record Markets revenue (up 79%) and Investment Banking fees (up 54%) in the Corporate & Investment Bank more than offset interest rate headwinds and reduced consumer activity. In Consumer & Community Banking, deposits and client investment assets continued to grow (up 20% and 9%, respectively) as we addressed our customers’ needs remotely as well as in our branches. Card sales volumes are down but have been consistently trending upward since April. We remained active in Home Lending on the strength of our digital platform, and Auto originations picked up in the second half of the quarter driven by pent up demand in states that are re-opening. We maintained our #1 rank in Global IB fees and grew our year-to-date share to 9.8% with strength across the franchise, including in Commercial Banking. The CB also grew loans 13% to $234 billion and deposits were up 41% as we helped clients manage their liquidity needs. In Asset & Wealth Management, AUM grew 15% driven by $124 billion of net inflows into liquidity and long-term products as we helped clients navigate market volatility.” Dimon concluded: “We are fully committed to doing our part both in promoting the safety of our employees and customers and helping the economies of the world recover from the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, including helping to drive policies and programs for the benefit of all of society and create opportunity for those who have been left out of the economy for far too long.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS 2Q20 results included: $8.9 billion of reserve builds Firmwide, as a result of COVID-19 ($2.19 decrease in earnings per share (EPS)) $678 million of Firmwide bridge book7 markups ($0.17 increase in EPS) $510 million of gains in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB related to funding spread tightening on derivatives ($0.13 increase in EPS) OPERATING LEVERAGE 2Q20 reported expense of $16.9 billion; reported overhead ratio of 51%; managed overhead ratio2 of 50% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED Common dividend of $2.8 billion, or $0.90 per share Announced suspension of repurchases at least through the end of 3Q208 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES Book value per share of $76.91, up 4%; tangible book value per share2 of $61.76, up 4% Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $191 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 12.4%; Advanced ratio3 of 13.1% Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.8%3 SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $1.2 trillion of credit and capital9 raised YTD $107 billion of credit for consumers $11 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $404 billion of credit for corporations $651 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $53 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities $28 billion of loans under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was $33.8 billion, up 15%. Net interest income was $14.0 billion, down 4%, with the impact of lower rates predominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets and balance sheet growth. Noninterest revenue was $19.9 billion, up 33%, largely driven by higher CIB Markets revenue and Investment Banking fees. The increase in revenue also included $678 million of markups on held-for-sale positions in the bridge book7 and a $510 million gain in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB driven by funding spread tightening on derivatives. Noninterest expense of $16.9 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by higher revenue-related expense, primarily compensation, largely offset by lower structural expense. The provision for credit losses was $10.5 billion, up $9.3 billion from the prior year driven by reserve builds which reflect further deterioration and increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook as a result of the impact of COVID-19. The Wholesale reserve build was $4.6 billion across multiple sectors, and the Consumer reserve build was $4.4 billion, largely in Card. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was $12.2 billion, down 9%. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $5.1 billion, down 26%, predominantly driven by the impact of deposit margin compression, lower transaction activity and customer relief, partially offset by growth in deposit balances. Home Lending net revenue was $1.7 billion, up 51%, predominantly driven by higher production margins. Card & Auto net revenue was $5.4 billion, relatively flat to the prior year, as the impact from lower Card sales volumes was largely offset by higher Card annual fees and lower acquisition costs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non- GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $76.91, $75.88 and $73.88 at June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, and June 30, 2019, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 3. The capital metrics reflect relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including neutralization of the effects of the Firm’s participation in the various programs and facilities established by the U.S. government. For the period ended June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $6.5 billion. As of June 30, 2020, the SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 10-11 and Capital Risk Management on pages 39-44 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-92 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics. 4. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 5. Net of stock issued to employees. 6. Excludes Commercial Card. 7. The bridge book consists of certain held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments, in CIB and CB. 8. On June 29, 2020, the Firm announced that the Federal Reserve Board has directed the Firm to discontinue its net share repurchases, at least through the end of the third quarter of 2020. 9. Credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. 10. In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation. 11. In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises: Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB. In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
