As previously announced on November&nbsp;2, 2017, Broadcom Limited, a public company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore (&#147; Broadcom-Singapore &#148;), has decided to restructure its corporate group to cause the parent company of the group to be a Delaware corporation (the &#147; Redomiciliation &#148;). In order to complete the Redomiciliation, the boards of directors of each of Broadcom-Singapore and Broadcom Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Broadcom Limited) (&#147; Broadcom-Delaware &#148;), approved the entry by Broadcom-Singapore and Broadcom-Delaware, respectively, into an Implementation Agreement (the &#147; Implementation Agreement &#148;). The Implementation Agreement was executed by Broadcom-Singapore and Broadcom-Delaware on February&nbsp;28, 2018 and provides for a statutory procedure known as a scheme of arrangement (the &#147; Scheme of Arrangement &#148;) to be implemented by Broadcom-Singapore and Broadcom-Delaware under Singapore law. Shareholders of Broadcom-Singapore approved the Scheme of Arrangement on March&nbsp;23, 2018, however it remains subject to approval by the High Court of the Republic of Singapore (the &#147; Singapore Court &#148;). Broadcom-Singapore has made an application to the Singapore Court to approve the Scheme of Arrangement and the application has been directed to be heard before the Singapore Court on April&nbsp;2, 2018 at 3:30 pm (Singapore Time), at 1 Supreme Court Lane, Singapore 178879 (the &#147; Hearing &#148;). Broadcom-Singapore shareholders who would like information on attending the hearing at the Singapore Court should contact Broadcom-Singapore through the company&#146;s website at http://investors.broadcom.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=203541&amp;p=irol-IRHome . If the Scheme of Arrangement is approved by the Singapore Court, the Singapore Court will issue an order approving the Scheme of Arrangement (the &#147; Singapore Court Order &#148;) after the Hearing is held. Once Broadcom-Singapore receives the Singapore Court Order and lodges the same with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore, the Scheme of Arrangement will become effective and binding on all shareholders of Broadcom-Singapore. Pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement, all issued ordinary shares in the capital of Broadcom-Singapore as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Scheme of Arrangement will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued shares of common stock of Broadcom-Delaware, and Broadcom-Singapore will become a subsidiary of Broadcom-Delaware. Additional information regarding the Redomiciliation can be found in Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A (the &#147; Proxy Statement &#148;), which Broadcom-Singapore filed on March&nbsp;9, 2018 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147; SEC &#148;). Investors may obtain copies of the current proxy statement, as well as other filings containing information about Broadcom-Singapore and Broadcom-Delaware, without charge, at the SEC&#146;s website ( http://www.sec.gov ).
