The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis. (b) Pre-provision profit, TBVPS and ROTCE are each non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) is also a non-GAAP financial measure; refer to page 9 for a reconciliation of common stockholders’ equity to TCE. Refer to page 28 for a further discussion of these measures. (c) Refer to Reconciliation from Reported to Managed Basis on page 7 for a further discussion of managed basis.

For the periods ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $2.9 billion, $3.3 billion, $3.8 billion, $4.5 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. The cumulative impact of $2.9 billion not recognized in CET1 capital at December 31, 2021 will be phased in at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. For the periods ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the SLR reflected the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021.

For the periods ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $2.9 billion, $3.3 billion, $3.8 billion, $4.5 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. The cumulative impact of $2.9 billion not recognized in CET1 capital at December 31, 2021 will be phased in at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. For the periods ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the SLR reflected the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021 for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics.

Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions; the restrictions were extended and expired at the end of the second quarter of 2021. The Firm is authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under the current repurchase program. (b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee stock options and SARs. (c) On September 21, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.00 per share. Page 10 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

(c) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. (d) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding CIB’s trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the wholesale allowance coverage ratio. (e) Refer to footnote (a) on page 25 for information on the Firm’s nonaccrual policy for credit card loans. Page 27 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures (a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. (b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. (d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio. (e) In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”), net yield, and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, without the volatility arising from CIB Markets. In addition, management also assesses CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management believes that disclosure of these measures provides investors and analysts with other measures by which to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.
