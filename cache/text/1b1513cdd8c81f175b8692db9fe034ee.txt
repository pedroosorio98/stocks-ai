Apple&#8217;s shareholders approved the 2022 Plan at the Company&#8217;s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on March&#160;4, 2022 (the &#8220;Annual Meeting&#8221;). Apple&#8217;s grant authority under the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the &#8220;2014 Plan&#8221;) will terminate after the 2022 Plan is registered on Form S-8. The 2022 Plan, which became effective upon shareholder approval, permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants and restricted stock units. Employees and consultants of Apple and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 2022 Plan. The maximum number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2022 Plan will equal: &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; 510&#160;million shares, plus &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; the number of shares available for new award grants under the 2014 Plan on the date of the Annual Meeting, plus &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan and outstanding as of the date of the Annual Meeting which expire or terminate after the Annual Meeting, plus &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; two times the number of shares subject to restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) or restricted awards granted under the 2014 Plan that are outstanding as of the date of the Annual Meeting that are forfeited or terminated or with respect to which shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations after the date of the Annual Meeting. The maximum number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2022 Plan as a result of applying the share limit formula described above will not exceed 1,274,374,682 shares. Shares issued with respect to full-value awards (RSUs or restricted stock awards) granted under the 2022 Plan are counted against the 2022 Plan&#8217;s aggregate share limit as two shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the full-value award. The 2022 Plan also includes other rules for counting shares against the share limits. The foregoing brief description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the 2022 Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Grants under the 2022 Plan may be evidenced by entry into the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement and the Performance Award Agreement under the 2022 Plan, forms of which are filed as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; Item&#160;5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
