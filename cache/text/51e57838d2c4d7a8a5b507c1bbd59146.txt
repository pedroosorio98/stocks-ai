Earnings per share were $1.28, compared with $0.74 in the first quarter of 2010. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter : “ The Firm’s results reflected a strong quarter across the Investment Bank and solid performance from Card Services, Commercial Banking, Treasury & Securities Services, and Asset Management . These results partially benefited from improved c redit trends in our credit card and wholesale businesses.” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Dimon continued: “Retail Financial Services demonstrated good underlying performance , while we continue d to invest in building branches and adding to our sales force . However, this performance was more than offset by the extraordinarily high losses we still are bearing on mortgage-related issues.(a) Unfortunately, these losses will continue for a while. R est assured, we are fully engaged in fixing our problems and addressing our mistakes from the past , and we will strive to build the best mortgage business going forward.” Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: “ We strengthened our fortress balance sheet, ending the first quarter with a strong Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.0% . Looking forward, we intend to operate the business with the objectives of maintaining a Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio of at least 9.0% and meeting the Basel III requirements substantially ahead of time. Our earnings power will allow us to generate significant capital in excess of our objectives , enabling us to invest aggressively in our future. “We were pleased that our strong balance sheet allowed us to increase our annual dividend to $1.00 per share and to r eestablish a significant share- repurchase program. Importantly, we wi ll only buy back stock if we believe the price is appropriate and if it benefits our remaining shareholders. In the meantime, w e will pursue the significant organic growth opportunities we see in each of our businesses as our top priority and our best use of capital.” Dimon also remarked: “In every way we can, we continue to support the economic recovery in the U.S. and around the world. This quarter alone, JPMorgan Chase provided credit to and raised capital for our clients of over $450 billion. These effo rts have a meaningful impact on our communities – we originated mortgages to over 180,000 people; we provided credit cards to approximately 2.6 million people; we len t or increased credit to over 7,500 small businesses, allowing them to expand; we lent to over 500 not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities; we extended or increased loan limits to approximately 1,500 middle market companies; and we lent to or raised capital for more than 3,500 corporations. In addition, we added 16,300 employees over the last twelve months, including more than 9,800 in the U.S. Furthermore, w e remain committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures. Since the beginning of 2009, we have offered 1,098,000 trial modifications to struggling homeowners.” Dimon concluded: “We believe that a strong regulatory environment is essential , and w e are working hard to ensure that we meet all the new rules and requirements, both in letter and spirit. While we expect to make numerous changes in our business, we do so with the needs and expectations of our customers foremost in our minds. As we look toward the future, we see incredible opportunities for the company, which our teams around the world are aggressively pursuing.” (a) Within Retail Financial Services, during the first quarter of 2011, losses on mortg ages and mortgage -related issues included (i) a provision for credit losses of $1.1 billion, (ii) a loss of $1.1 billion for the impact of increased servicing costs on the fair value of the Firm’s mortgage servicing rights asset , (iii) $650 million of expense for the estimated costs of foreclosure-related matters, and (iv) mortgage repurchase losses of $420 million.

Average loans were $132.5 billion, a decrease of $23.3 billion, or 15%, from the prior year and a decrease of $ 3.0 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter.

News Release 7 Net revenue was $4.0 billion, a decrease of $465 million, or 10%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, down by $489 million, or 13%.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $ 5.6 billion, up by $2.2 billion, or 67%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by a significantly lo wer provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. Net revenue was $2 5.8 billion, a decrease of $ 2.4 billion, or 8%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1 3.8 billion, down by $605 million, or 4%, from the prior year; the decrease was driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, and lower securities gains , partially offset by higher investment banking fees . Net interest income was $ 12.0 billion, down by $1.8 billion, or 13%, driven by lower loan and securities balances. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, down by $5.8 billion, or 83%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion, compared with $7.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in the provision reflected improved delinquency trends and a reduction in the allowance for credit losses for the credit card portfolio as a result of lower estimated losses. Consumer net charge-offs1 were $3.6 billion, compared with $7.0 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 3.77% and 6.61%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $ 386 million, compared with a benefit of $236 milli on in the prior year primarily reflecting continued improvement in the credit environment from the year- ago period. Wholesale net charge-offs were $ 165 million, compared with $959 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.30% and 1.84%, respectively.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In additio n to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the report ed U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non -GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end -of-period loans exclu des the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge -off rates exclude the impact of P CI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased credit -impaired portfolio totaled $4.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $2.8 billion at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, respectively. c. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Ti er 1 common divided by risk- weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity , such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred capita l debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non- GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm u ses Tier 1 common along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. d. Headcount -related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance -based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. e. In Card Services, supplemental information is provided for Chase, excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios, to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. f. Treasury & Securities Services firmw ide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, ma nagement reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in management’s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. g. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another b asis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
