SALES PROCEDURE &nbsp; 4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holders of Level III BDRs, including participants of the NuS&oacute;cios Customer Program, that do not manifest themselves until 11 of August 2023 (end date of the Choice Period), or that manifest themselves in disagreement with the terms established in Sections 2 and 3 above, will automatically adhere to the Sales Procedure, by means of which all the shares that serve as the underlying of their Level III BDRs will be sell on NYSE, in order to receive an amount equivalent to the average price per share practiced in the sale of the shares, net of any taxes that may be due according to the applicable legislation. &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the end of the Choice Period, if the holder of Level III BDRs has not manifested the choice, B3 will, after August 11, 2023, block the respective balance of the holder of Level III BDRs until the date of sale of the Class A Ordinary Shares on NYSE and will register in its systems a provision for the redemption of Level III BDRs which corresponds to the market value of the Class A Ordinary Shares as of the close of business on August 11, 2023 in Dollars, which will be converted into Brazilian currency at the current US$/BRL exchange rate. &nbsp; 4.2.1. Such amount will be disclosed by the Company through the publication of a Notice to BDR Holders (&quot; First Notice &quot;) and will be considered only an estimate, which may be altered upon the actual sale of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE, and may be higher, lower or equal to the estimated sales value. &nbsp; 4.2.2. The final sales value of the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs will be informed in due course, and such value will be used for the financial settlement of the redemption of the Level III BDRs by B3. &nbsp; 4.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By August 18, 2023, B3 will calculate the number of Class A Ordinary Shares for which there has been no manifestation for the Receipt of Class A Ordinary Shares or the Receipt of Unsponsored Level I BDRs and will inform the Custodian bank, which will take the necessary procedures to operationalize the sale of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE. &nbsp; 4.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale of the Class A Ordinary Share will be conducted on a best efforts basis by the Depositary on the NYSE within thirty (30) days of August 21, 2023. &nbsp; 4.4.1. The commencement date for the sale of the Class A Ordinary Stock on the NYSE may be advanced or delayed for operational reasons. &nbsp; 4.4.2. The Depositary may, at its discretion, conduct the sales of the Class A Ordinary Shares that are the object of the Sales Procedure in a period of less than thirty (30) days, in which case the estimated dates in the schedule of Annex I shall be adjusted accordingly. &nbsp; 4.4.3. Depending on the number of Class A Ordinary Shares to be sold, the sale may take place on one or more subsequent days, and the sale price of each share to be paid to the respective holders of Level III BDRs will correspond to the average of the sale prices of such Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE, less any taxes that may be due under the applicable legislation. &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4.4. The amount at which the Class A Ordinary Shares will be sold on the NYSE through the Sales Procedure may be less than the listing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE on the date of the sale if there has been some other event that creates a variation in the listing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE or, for example, the sale of the Class A Ordinary Shares is made through a block-trade , which traditionally is executed at a discount from the market quotation price. &nbsp; 4.4.5. The Custodian, the Depositary and the Company assume no obligation to Level III BDR holders to sell the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs for any specific amount or to compensate such Level III BDR holders for any loss, damage or liability that may arise as a result of the sale of the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs through the Sales Procedure. &nbsp; 4.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to allow Level III BDR holders to make an informed decision, the Company presents the following information. Such information, however, does not constitute a guarantee of the sale price of the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs in the context of the Sales Procedure, and should not under any circumstances be considered a recommendation to sell or hold the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs. &nbsp; 4.5.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighted average price of BDRs Level III at B3 in the 12 (twelve) months prior to the publication of this Notice: R$ 4.33 &nbsp; 4.5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighted average listing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE in the twelve (12) months prior to the publication of this Notice in U.S. dollars: $5.00 &nbsp; 4.5.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighted average listing price of the Class A Ordinary Shares on NYSE in the twelve (12) months prior to the publication of this Notice in Reais: R$25.65 &nbsp; 4.5.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equity value per BDR based on the Company's Interim Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2023: R$278.99 &nbsp; 4.5.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equity value per Class A Ordinary Share based on the Company's Interim Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2023: $1.44 (*) (*) US$1 = R$5.0804, based on the exchange rate on March 31, 2023. &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceeds from the sale of the Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs will be received by the Depositary in Dollars upon completion of the sale of all shares underlying the Level III BDRs subject to the Sales Procedure. &nbsp; 4.6.1. The Depositary will convert the amount into Reais, considering the US$/BRL exchange rate current on the day of conversion, after deducting any applicable taxes under the terms of the legislation in force. &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.6.2. The Company will publish a new Notice to BDR Holders (&quot; Second Notice &quot;) informing, among other information, (i) the total amount of Class A Ordinary Shares underlying the Level III BDRs sold, (ii) the average prices in Dollars per share/BDR, (iii) the estimated date of payment to Level III BDR holders in Brazil, and (iv) the final price in Brazilian Reais to be paid per Level III BDR to Level III BDRs holders, net of any taxes which may be due, pursuant to applicable legislation &nbsp; 4.6.3. The Depositary (i) will transfer to B3 the funds related to Level III BDR holders that maintained their positions deposited with B3's Central Depository, which in turn will be responsible for transferring such funds to the respective holders, through its custody agents; and (ii) will transfer the amounts due to Level III BDR holders that maintained their positions directly with the Depositary. &nbsp; If the holder of a Level III BDR is not registered with his custody agent, he must update his registration, since the proceeds from the sale of shares will be transferred according to the data registered with the custody agent at B3 on the date of the above-mentioned transfer. &nbsp; 4.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BDR Level III holders who do not have their records updated with their custody agent, as the case may be, should contact their custody agent, as the case may be, to withdraw their funds. 5. CANCELLATION OF THE REGISTRATION AS A PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY WITH CVM &nbsp; 5.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the discontinuance of the Level III BDR Program through the realization of the procedures foreseen in the previous items, the Company will proceed with the request for the Cancellation of the Registration. &nbsp; 5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company will keep the market informed, under the terms of the applicable legislation, about the CVM decision regarding the Cancellation of Registration. &nbsp; 6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION &nbsp; 6.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company confirms that (i) it has not issued other securities that are outstanding in Brazil and that, therefore, the Discontinuance of the Level III BDR Program will lead to the Cancellation of the Registration; and (ii) all information about the Company, its results and operations, as well as all information required by CVM, is available on the CVM ( http://www.cvm.gov.br ), B3 ( http://www.b3.com.br ) and the Company's own website (https://www.investidores.nu/en/ ). &nbsp; 6.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs arising from the disassembly of the Level III BDRs into Class A Ordinary Shares, and/or from the conversion of Sponsored Level III BDRs into Unsponsored Level I BDRs, due to the option made during the Choice Period, will be borne by the Company. The costs arising from the Sales Procedure, including those related to the hiring of the Bank responsible for the selling of the Class A Ordinary Shares on the NYSE, will also be borne by the Company. The taxes and other costs, including those related to the opening and maintenance of accounts at an institution authorized to operate on NYSE, will be borne exclusively by the holder of the Level III BDR in question. &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holders of Level III BDRs, residents and nonresidents in Brazil, are responsible for verifying the tax and exchange effects of the transactions contemplated in this Notice, as well as for compliance with the obligations arising from the option made.
