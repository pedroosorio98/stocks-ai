These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. Revenue Revenue was a record $26.0 billion, up 262% from a year ago and up 18% sequentially. Data Center revenue was a record, up 427% from a year ago and up 23% sequentially. Data Center compute revenue was $19.4 billion, up 478% from a year ago and up 29% sequentially. These increases reflect higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform used for training and inferencing with large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking revenue was $3.2 billion, up 242% from a year ago on strong growth of InfiniBand end-to-end solutions, and down 5% sequentially due to the timing of supply. Strong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by Enterprise and Consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continued to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale, representing mid-40% of our Data Center revenue. Gaming revenue was up 18% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher demand. The sequential decrease reflects seasonally lower GPU sales for laptops. Professional Visualization revenue was up 45% from a year ago and down 8% sequentially. The year- on-year increase primarily reflects higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential decrease was primarily due to desktop workstation GPUs. Automotive revenue was up 11% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was driven primarily by self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by AI Cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. Gross Margin GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter increased significantly from a year ago on strong Data Center revenue growth primarily driven by our Hopper GPU computing platform. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins benefited from lower inventory charges. As noted last quarter, both the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 benefited from favorable component costs. Expenses GAAP operating expenses were up 39% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 43% from a year ago and up 13% sequentially. The increases were primarily driven by compensation and benefits, reflecting growth in employees and compensation. Other Income & Expense and Income Tax GAAP other income and expense (OI&E) includes interest income, interest expense, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and other. Non-GAAP OI&E excludes the gains or losses from non- affiliated investments and the portion of interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount. Interest income was $359 million, up from a year ago and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher cash balances. Net realized and unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments were $69 million, reflecting fair value adjustments. GAAP effective tax rate was 13.9%, an increase from a year ago reflecting the lower effect of tax benefits from the foreign derived intangible income deduction and stock-based compensation relative to the increase in pre-tax income. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.0%. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $31.4 billion, up from $15.3 billion a year ago and $26.0 billion a quarter ago. The increases primarily reflect higher revenue partially offset by stock repurchases. Accounts receivable was $12.4 billion with days sales outstanding (DSO) of 43. Accounts receivable reflects $429 million of customer payments received prior to next quarter’s invoice due date. Inventory was $5.9 billion with days sales of inventory (DSI) of 95. Purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity were $18.8 billion. Prepaid supply agreements were $5.6 billion. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $10.6 billion, including $8.8 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect cloud service agreements to be used to support our research and development efforts and our DGX Cloud offerings. As of the end of the first quarter, we had additional commitments of approximately $1.2 billion to complete business combinations and purchase assets, subject to closing conditions. Cash flow from operating activities was $15.3 billion, up from $2.9 billion a year ago and $11.5 billion a quarter ago. The year-on-year increase reflects higher revenue, and the sequential increase reflects higher revenue and lower cash taxes. We expect a substantial increase in cash taxes in the second quarter related to federal and state estimated tax payments. We utilized cash of $7.8 billion towards shareholder returns, including $7.7 billion in share repurchases and $98 million in cash dividends. We announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of our issued common stock to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024 will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024. We also announced a 150% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024. Second Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Outlook Outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows: • Revenue is expected to be $28.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. • GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, gross margins are expected to be in the mid-70% range. • GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the low-40% range. • GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. • GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. ___________________________ For further information, contact: Simona Jankowski Mylene Mangalindan Investor Relations Corporate Communications NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA Corporation sjankowski@nvidia.com mmangalindan@nvidia.com Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non- GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
