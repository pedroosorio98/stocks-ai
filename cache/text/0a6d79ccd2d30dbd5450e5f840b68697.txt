The Existing Credit Agreement originally provided for a $30.4&#160;billion term loan credit facility.

Absent termination, the term loan credit facility under the Existing Credit Agreement would have matured in 2028. Borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bore interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company&#8217;s option, the alternate base rate or Term SOFR (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), in each case, plus an applicable margin that was calculated based on the Company&#8217;s credit ratings from time to time. Many of the lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement and/or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending, hedging, cash management and/or commercial banking services, or other services in the ordinary course of business for the Company and its subsidiaries (including in connection with the transactions described in this Current Report on Form&#160;8-K),&#160;for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and expense reimbursement. &#160; Item&#8201;8.01 Other Events.
