On June 28, 2021, NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, completed a simplification of its corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. intellectual property to the United States via domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. In connection with the Domestication, the Company is updating its tax rate outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as follows: &#8226; GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 13 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, excluding any discrete items, up from 10 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, provided in our prior outlook. GAAP discrete items include one-time tax impacts from the Domestication and excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, which are expected to generate variability on a quarter-by-quarter basis. The discrete tax impact from the Domestication in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is expected to be a benefit of approximately $250 million to $300 million. The information in this Item 7.01 is furnished and shall not be deemed &#8220;filed&#8221; for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or subject to the liabilities of that Section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference in any filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made by the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. Item 8.01 Other Events. As described above, on June 28, 2021, the Company completed the Domestication, which more closely aligns the Company&#8217;s corporate structure to its operating structure in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#8217;s Base Erosion and Profit Sharing conclusions and changes to U.S. and European tax laws.
