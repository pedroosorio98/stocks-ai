Our record results in 2023 reflect over-earning on both NII and credit, but we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver very healthy returns even after they normalize. Our balance sheet remained extremely strong, with a CET1 ratio of 15.0%, a staggering $514 billion of total loss-absorbing capacity and $1.4 trillion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to believe that the recent series of regulatory and legislative proposals, including Basel III endgame, could cause serious harm to consumers, businesses, and markets. We hope that regulators will make the necessary adjustments so the rules promote a strong financial system without causing undue consequences for end users. 2023 was a good example of the power of our investment philosophy and fortress principles, as well as the value of being there for clients—as we always are—in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across the Firm. We will highlight a few examples: CCB added over 2 million net new checking accounts in 2023; CIB maintained its #1 rank in both IB and Markets and gained over 100bps of IB market share; CB added over 5,000 new relationships, roughly 2x the prior year; and AWM saw record client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record. The U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. There is also an ongoing need for increased spending due to the green economy, the restructuring of global supply chains, higher military spending and rising healthcare costs. This may lead inflation to be stickier and rates to be higher than markets expect. On top of this, there are a number of downside risks to watch. Quantitative tightening is draining over $900 billion of liquidity from the system annually, and we have never seen a full cycle of tightening. And the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. While we hope for the best, the past year demonstrated why we must be prepared for any environment. To conclude, I want to thank our tremendous employees for making us one of the most trusted financial institutions in the world. They work tirelessly to serve our clients, including extending credit and raising capital totaling $2.3 trillion, as well as providing continuity for First Republic customers.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN 4Q23 RESULTS n $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment in Corporate ($0.74 decrease in EPS) n $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate ($0.19 decrease in EPS) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.1 billion or $1.05 per share n $2.0 billion of common stock net repurchases11 n Net payout LTM11,12 of 41% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $104.45, up 16%; tangible book value per share2 of $86.08, up 18% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $251 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 15.0%; Advanced ratio3 of 15.0% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.1% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $2.3 trillion of credit and capital13 raised in 2023 n $239 billion of credit for consumers n $36 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $1.0 trillion of credit for corporations n $915 billion of capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $47 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-2438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the fourth quarter of 2023 versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

The net reserve build included a $546 million net build in Consumer, driven by loan growth in Card Services, and a $41 million net build in Wholesale. Net charge-offs of $2.2 billion were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card Services and single-name exposures in Wholesale which were largely previously reserved.

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $104.45, $100.30 and $ 90.29 at December 31, 2023 , September 30, 2023 , and December 31, 2022, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K. d. Fourth-quarter 2023 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Significant items collectively refer to the FDIC special assessment of $2.9 billion and net investment securities losses of $743 million. Excluding these significant items resulted in an increase of $2.7 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $9.3 billion to $12.1 billion; an increase of $0.93 per share to reported EPS from $3.04 to $3.97; and an increase of approximately 4% to ROTCE from 15% to 19%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
