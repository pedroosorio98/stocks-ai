(the &#8220;Company&#8221;), Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (the&#160;&#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Credit Agreement replaces the prior $10.0 billion amended and restated credit agreement entered into by the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and other lenders on March 29, 2022, which was terminated on November 1, 2023. The Credit Agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $15.0 billion. The term of the Credit Agreement is five years, but it may be extended on one or more occasions for additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. &#160; In addition, on November 1, 2023, the Company, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement (the &#8220;Short-Term Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Short-Term Credit Agreement replaces the prior $10.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into by the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and other lenders on November 18, 2022, which was terminated on November 1, 2023. The Short-Term Credit Agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $5.0 billion. The term of the Short-Term Credit Agreement is 364 days, but it may be extended for an additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. &#160; The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. &#160; Borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes, including backstopping any notes that the Company may issue under its commercial paper program. &#160; The Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement contain customary representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, but do not contain financial covenants. Upon an event of default that is not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the Credit Agreement or the Short-Term Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments may be terminated. &#160; The financial institutions party to the Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage, and other financial and non-financial activities and services.
