Some of the limitations of FCF are: (i) FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, and (ii) other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. As a result of our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019, we have conformed our definition of free cash flow to the nomenclature of the new accounting standard.
