Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Spears Severance Benefit Agreement provides that, except as otherwise provided in an applicable award agreement, in the event a Change in Control (as defined in the Spears Severance Benefit Agreement) occurs and Ms.&#160;Spears holds PSUs that vest based upon the achievement of performance goals and for which any performance period has not been completed, then the performance goals applicable to each such performance period will be deemed met at target levels.
