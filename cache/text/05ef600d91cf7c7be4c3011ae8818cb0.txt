Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.3 billion, up 5%. Net revenue was $24.5 billion, down 3%, driven by lower Mortgage Banking revenue and lower CIB Markets revenue related to business simplification, partially offset by growth in Asset Management. Noninterest expense was $14.5 billion, down 6%, driven by business simplification, lower legal expense and lower Mortgage Banking expense. The provision for credit losses was $935 million, up 35%, despite lower net charge-offs, due to lower reserve releases compared with the prior year. In the current quarter, consumer reserve releases of $324 million were largely offset by an increase in reserves across the wholesale businesses of $252 million driven by select downgrades, including Oil & Gas.

News Release 3 Mortgage Banking net income was $584 million, a decrease of 20%. Net revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of 21%, driven by lower net servicing revenue and lower repurchase benefit.

Net revenue was $8.7 billion, a decrease of 6%. Banking revenue13 was $2.9 billion, down 3%, reflecting lower Lending revenue due to losses on securities received from restructurings. Investment banking revenue was up 4% on higher advisory fees and higher debt underwriting fees, partially offset by lower equity underwriting fees compared to a strong quarter for equity underwriting in the prior year. Treasury Services revenue14 was $901 million, down 2%, driven by lower net interest income largely offset by noninterest revenue. Markets & Investor Services revenue13 was $5.8 billion, down 7%. Excluding the revenue decline related to business simplification and the Markit IPO gain in the second quarter of 2014, Total Markets revenue would have been down 1%1, and Fixed Income Markets revenue would have been down 10%1. This was driven by continued weakness in Credit and Securitized Products, as well as lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging Markets, partially offset by strength in Rates. Equity Markets revenue was up 27% driven by strong performance across derivatives and cash. Noninterest expense was $5.1 billion, down 15%, driven by business simplification, lower legal expense and lower compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was $50 million, up $134 million from the prior year, reflecting higher reserves, driven by Oil & Gas. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a) In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b) Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period- end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c) Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures, and exclude Firmwide legal expense ($291 million in the second quarter of 2015). Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. d) Estimated as of 2Q15. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For further discussion of these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 146–153 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and pages 55-61 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. e) The CIB provides the change in Total Markets and Fixed Income Markets revenue excluding the revenue related to business simplification and the Markit IPO gain in the second quarter of 2014, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the underlying performance of the business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 2.

For further discussion, see page 2 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. 9. Represents the estimated liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") based on the U.S. LCR rules which became effective January 1, 2015. 10. High quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) is the estimated amount of assets that qualify for inclusion in the U.S. LCR, which became effective January 1, 2015. 11. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents credit provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. 12. Chase Commerce Solutions, formerly known as Chase Merchant Services, includes the Chase Paymentech, ChaseNet and Chase Offers businesses. 13. Effective in the second quarter of 2015, Investment banking revenue (formerly Investment banking fees) incorporates all revenue associated with investment banking activities, and is reported net of investment banking revenue shared with other lines of business; previously such shared revenue had been reported in Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 14. Effective in the second quarter of 2015, Trade Finance revenue was transferred from Treasury Services to Lending. Prior periods have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 15.
