(&#8220; Tesla &#8221;) entered into an Indemnification Agreement (the &#8220; Indemnification Agreement &#8221;) with Elon Musk, Tesla&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, for an interim term of 90 days (the &#8220; Bridge Term &#8221;). During the Bridge Term, Tesla is resuming its annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; indemnity coverage, which it had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, Tesla intends to obtain a binding market quote for a directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100 million (the &#8220; Market Quote &#8221;), which Tesla will weigh in selecting an indemnity coverage option for a customary term following the end of the Bridge Term. &#160; The Indemnification Agreement provides that Mr. Musk will provide, from his personal funds, directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; indemnity coverage to Tesla during the Bridge Term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by Tesla, up to a total of $100 million. In return, Tesla will pay Mr. Musk a one-time fee of $972,361. Tesla will also exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain the Market Quote, and will pay an additional amount to Mr. Musk to reconcile the one-time fee to be equal to the market-based premium for the Market Quote as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50%, if the latter amount is greater. The Indemnification Agreement is also subject to certain terms and conditions that are customary of indemnification agreements with corporate directors and officers. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; SIGNATURES &#160; Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. &#160; &#160; &#160; TESLA, INC. &#160; &#160; &#160; By: &#160; /s/ Zachary J.
