Cayman Islands &nbsp; &nbsp; Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated statements of financial position of Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of September 30, 2024, the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income or loss for nine and three-month period ended, changes in equity and cash flows for the nine and three-month period then ended, and notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo; issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements based on our review. &nbsp; Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with Brazilian and International Standards on Review (NBC TR 2410 - Revis&atilde;o de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Intermedi&aacute;rias Executada pelo Auditor da Entidade and ISRE 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity , respectively). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. &nbsp; KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda., uma sociedade simples brasileira, de responsabilidade limitada e firma-membro da organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o global KPMG de firmas-membro independentes licenciadas da KPMG International Limited, uma empresa inglesa privada de responsabilidade limitada.

Eligible customers were also informed that Nucoins could be temporarily swapped for certain crypto assets. As result, the Group recorded US$40 million, primarily attributed to marketing expenses, aimed at repositioning Nucoins within the new loyalty program, as well as US$8 million attributable to the impairment of certain capitalized intangible assets associated with the liquidity pool feature. As a result of the discontinuation of the liquidity pool, Nucoins are no longer classified as a crypto-asset under SAB 121. &nbsp; 2.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounting balances of Nu Holdings and all those subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, directly or indirectly. Control is achieved where the Company has (i) power over the investee; (ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) can use its power to affect its profits. The Company re-assesses whether it maintains control of an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three above mentioned elements of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over it and ceases when the Company loses control over it. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the consolidated statements of profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. The financial information of the subsidiaries was prepared for the same period as the Company and consistent accounting policies were applied. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Company. Accordingly, all balances, transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising between consolidated entities are eliminated in the consolidation, except for foreign-currency gain and losses on translation of intercompany loans. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, when applicable. The subsidiaries below are the most relevant entities included in these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements: Entity &nbsp; Control &nbsp; Principal activities &nbsp; Functional currency &nbsp; Country &nbsp; Interest in total capital % &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 12/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Pagamentos S.A. - Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamentos (&#8220;Nu Pagamentos&#8221;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Credit card and prepaid account operations &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 100% &nbsp; 100% Nu Financeira S.A. &#8211; SCFI (&#8220;Nu Financeira&#8221;) &nbsp; Indirect &nbsp; Loan operations &nbsp; BRL &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 100% &nbsp; 100% Nu Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mobiliarios Ltda.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, the Company consolidated investment funds as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in which the Group&#8217;s companies hold a substantial interest or the entirety of the interests and are therefore exposed, or have rights, to variable returns and have the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. &nbsp; 4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The material accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Annual Financial Statements and therefore should be read in conjunction. &nbsp; 5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires judgments, estimates, and assumptions from management that affect the application of accounting policies, and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to the estimates are recognized prospectively. The significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were the same as those adopted in the Annual Financial Statements. Credit losses on financial instruments for credit card receivables and loans to customers The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on credit cards receivables and loans to customers that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of allowance as of each reporting date. Management performs an analysis of the credit card and loan amounts to determine if credit losses have occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. Key areas of judgment The critical judgments made by management in applying the expected credit losses (&quot;ECL&quot;) allowance methodology are: a) Definition of default; b) Forward-looking information used for the projection of macroeconomic scenarios; c) Probability weights of future scenarios; d) Definition of significant increase in credit risk and credit card lifetime; and e) Look-back period, used for parameters estimation (probability of default - PD, exposure at default - EAD and loss given default - LGD). &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sensitivity analysis On September 30, 2024, the ECL allowance for credit card receivables and loans to customers totaled US$3,279,005 of which US$2,526,394 related to credit card receivables and US$752,611 to loans to customers. The ECL allowance is sensitive to the methodology, assumptions and estimations underlying its calculation. One key assumption is the probability weighting of the macroeconomic scenarios between upside, base and downside as the carrying amount of the credit loss allowance is determined based on the weighted average of these scenarios. Such weightings reflect management's perception around the current and future expectations of the macroeconomic environment based on, but not limited to, GDP, Inflation, Unemployment and Interest Rates in each of the geographies the Group operates. The table below illustrates the ECL based on the weighted average of these three macroeconomic scenarios and the ECL that would have arisen if management had applied a 100% weighting to each macroeconomic scenario. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weighted average &nbsp; Upside &nbsp; Base case &nbsp; Downside &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card and lending ECL &nbsp; 3,279,005 &nbsp; 3,074,242 &nbsp; 3,255,980 &nbsp; 3,583,744 &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group executes transactions with derivative financial instruments, which are intended to meet its own needs to reduce its exposure to market, currency and interest-rate risks. The derivatives are classified at fair value through profit or loss, except those in cash flow hedge accounting strategies, for which the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives is recognized directly in other comprehensive income. The management of these risks is conducted through determining limits, and the establishment of operating strategies. The derivative contracts are considered level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are used to hedge exposures, but hedge accounting is adopted only for forecasted transactions related to the cloud infrastructure, intercompany transactions and certain software licenses used by Nu (hedge of foreign currency risk), to hedge interest of the fixed rate credit portfolio (hedge of interest rate risk of portfolio) and to hedge the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting or SOP exercise, as shown below. &nbsp; 42 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

The Group managed its exposures to the variability in cash flows of foreign currency forecasted transactions to movements in foreign exchange rates by entering into foreign currency exchange rate contracts (exchange futures). These instruments are entered into to match the cash flow profile of the estimated forecast transactions and are exchange-traded with fair value movements settled on a daily basis. The Group applies hedge accounting to the forecasted transactions related to its main cloud infrastructure contract and other expenses in foreign currency including intercompany expenses. The effectiveness is assessed monthly by analyzing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the amount of the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. Derivatives are generally rolled over monthly. They are expected to occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedged item. Therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transaction have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective. Sources of ineffectiveness are differences in the amount and timing of forecast and actual payment of expenses. &nbsp; 46 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; The table below shows the change in the hedge of foreign currency risk: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nine-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; (8,254) &nbsp; (2,610) Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; 17,648 &nbsp; (18,714) Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period &nbsp; 3,089 &nbsp; 15,593 to &quot;Customer support and operation&quot; &nbsp; (1,690) &nbsp; 11,087 to &quot;General and administrative expenses&quot; &nbsp; 4,358 &nbsp; 4,802 to &quot;Other income (expenses)&quot; &nbsp; 3,329 &nbsp; - Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; (2,908) &nbsp; (296) Deferred income taxes &nbsp; (7,495) &nbsp; 1,160 Balance at end of the period &nbsp; 4,988 &nbsp; (4,571) &nbsp; The expected future transactions that are the hedged item are: &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 12/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to 3 months &nbsp; 3 to 12 months &nbsp; Total &nbsp; Total Expected foreign currency transactions &nbsp; 44,594 &nbsp; 108,358 &nbsp; 152,952 &nbsp; 187,456 Total &nbsp; 44,594 &nbsp; 108,358 &nbsp; 152,952 &nbsp; 187,456 &nbsp; b) Hedge of corporate and social security taxes over share-based compensation The Group's hedge strategy is to cover the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate and social security taxes at RSU vesting from the variation of the Company's share price volatility. The derivative financial instruments used to cover the exposure are total return swaps (&quot;TRS&quot;) in which one leg is indexed to the Company's stock price and the other leg is indexed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&quot;SOFR&quot;) plus spread. The stock fixed at the TRS is a weighted average price. The hedge was entered into by Nu Holdings and therefore there is no income tax effect. The Group applies the cash flow hedge for the hedge structure thus the market risk is replaced by an interest rate risk. The effectiveness assessment is performed monthly by (i) assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) monitoring the credit risk impact in the hedge effectiveness; and (iii) maintaining and updating the hedging ratio. Given the possibility of forfeiture impacting the future cash forecast of the employee benefit plan, the Group manages exposures to keep the hedging level within an acceptable coverage. The derivative fair value is measured substantially based on the stock price which is also used in the measurement of the provision or payment for corporate and social security taxes. There is no expectation for a mismatch between the hedged item and hedging instrument at maturity other than the SOFR. &nbsp; 47 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; In June 2024, the Group modified its risk management objective of the hedge accounting for corporate and social security taxes to reduce the portion being hedged from a pre-income tax effect to a post-income tax effect, aiming to hedge the effects of the Company's share price changes on the hedged items net of the income tax effects. As a result, the Group partially settled the TRS in an amount equivalent to the income tax rates applicable exposure. The gain related to TRS settled, in the amount of US$14,130 accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income, is being reclassified to the statement of profit or loss in the proportion of the settlement of the related liability. As of September 30, 2024, US$12,083 of the total has been reclassified to profit or loss. &nbsp; The table below shows the change in the hedge of corporate and social security taxes over share-based compensation: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nine-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 09/30/2023 Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; 20,671 &nbsp; (4,876) Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; 59,775 &nbsp; 46,128 Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to the statement of profit or loss during the period (note 10) &nbsp; (45,463) &nbsp; (24,205) to &quot;Customer support and operations&quot; &nbsp; (1,561) &nbsp; (858) to &quot;General and administrative expenses&quot; &nbsp; (42,686) &nbsp; (22,736) to &quot;Marketing expenses&quot; &nbsp; (1,216) &nbsp; (611) Balance at end of the period &nbsp; 34,983 &nbsp; 17,047 &nbsp; Expected cash disbursement &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 12/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to 1 year &nbsp; 1 to 3 years &nbsp; Over 3 years &nbsp; Total &nbsp; Total Considering the reporting date fair value of the hedged item: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expected cash disbursement for corporate and social contributions &nbsp; 57,501 &nbsp; 110,611 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 168,112 &nbsp; 110,596 Total &nbsp; 57,501 &nbsp; 110,611 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 168,112 &nbsp; 110,596 &nbsp; 48 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

In Mexico, it includes &quot;Cuenta Nu&quot;. In Brazil, &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot; is a prepaid account in which the amounts deposited by customers are classified as electronic money and must be allocated to government securities (see note 12b) or in a specific account maintained at the Central Bank of Brazil (see note 15), in accordance with Brazilian regulatory requirements. &nbsp; In Mexico, &quot;Cuenta Nu&quot; balances are not required to be invested in specific assets; and therefore, they can be used as a financing source for the credit card operations in Mexico. The RDBs are an investment option inside &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot; and can have daily liquidity or defined future maturity. Deposits in RDB have guarantees from the Brazilian Deposit Guarantee Fund (&#8220;FGC&#8221;). Unlike the deposits in electronic money, Nu is required to follow the compulsory deposits requirements for RDB deposits (see note 15), however it is not required to invest the remaining resources in government securities or in specific account maintained at the Central Bank of Brazil - these amounts can be used as a financing source for lending and credit card operations. There are also RDBs with a defined future maturity date, which have a maturity of up to 27 months and a weighted average interest rate of 120% of the Brazilian CDI rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The interest paid on both &quot;Conta do Nubank&quot; and RDB deposits (except fixed term RDBs) is 100% of the Brazilian CDI rate as of the initial date if the balances are kept for more than 30 days.

The programs consist of accumulating points according to the use of the credit card in the ratio of R$1.00 (one Brazilian real, equivalent to US$0.18 as of September 30, 2024 and US$0.21 as of December 31, 2023) equal to 0.5 and 1 point in cashback for Nubank+ and Ultravioleta, respectively. The points do not expire and there is no limit on the number of rewards an eligible card member can earn. Deferred annual fees from the reward program comprise amounts related to the rewards fees which are paid in advance by customers. The redemption of the points occurs in cashback or air miles Program. Nu uses financial models to estimate the redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members, and, therefore, the estimated financial value of the points, based on historical redemption trends and current enrollee redemption behavior, among others. The estimated financial value is recorded in the statement of profit or loss when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is when the reward points are redeemed. &nbsp; 56 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) Fair value methodology consists of discounting the cash flows from acquired credit card receivables, using observable spreads from the credit card issuers. (iii) Borrowings and financing include the fair value calculated by the discounted cash flow method and also cases in which the fair value is the same amount as the book value (cases with prepayment clauses at the amortized cost). The fair value of floating rate demand deposits is assumed to be equal to carrying amounts. The valuation approach to specific categories of financial instruments is described below. i) Fair value models and inputs Credit card: The fair values of credit card receivables and payables to the network are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Fair values are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and credit spread. For payables, cash flows are also discounted by the Group's own credit spread. Loans to customers: Fair value is estimated based on groups of customers with similar risk profiles, using valuation models. The fair value of a loan is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. Other receivables: Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows by the interest rate curve and a credit spread. b) Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value The following table shows a summary of the fair values, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of the financial assets and liabilities indicated below, classified on the basis of the various measurement methods used by the Group to determine their fair value: &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair value Level 1 &nbsp; Fair value Level 2 &nbsp; Fair value Level 3 &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Short-term investments &nbsp; 373,649 &nbsp; 13,858 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 387,507 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Government bonds &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 9,117,495 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 9,117,495 United States &nbsp; 138,060 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 138,060 Mexico &nbsp; 198,755 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 198,755 Colombia &nbsp; 2,575 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 2,575 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corporate bonds and other instruments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certificate of bank deposits (CDB) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 8,244 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 8,244 Investment funds &nbsp; 40,538 &nbsp; 24,263 &nbsp; 79,241 &nbsp; 144,042 Time deposit &nbsp; - &nbsp; 297,251 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 297,251 Notes &nbsp; - &nbsp; 50,384 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 50,384 Bill of credit (LC) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 11 Real estate and agribusiness certificate of receivables &nbsp; - &nbsp; 11,639 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 11,639 Real estate and agribusiness letter of credit &nbsp; - &nbsp; 661 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 661 Corporate bonds and debentures &nbsp; 1,076,327 &nbsp; 79,911 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,156,238 Equity instrument &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 13,126 &nbsp; 13,126 Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 1,791 &nbsp; 193,452 &nbsp; 29 &nbsp; 195,272 Collateral for credit card operations &nbsp; - &nbsp; 332 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 332 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 142,096 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 142,105 Repurchase agreements &nbsp; - &nbsp; 482,363 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 482,363 &nbsp; 59 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; i) Fair value models and inputs Securities: The securities with high liquidity and quoted prices in the active market are classified as level 1. Therefore, all government bonds and some corporate bonds are included in level 1 as they are traded in active markets. Brazilian securities values are the published prices by the &quot; Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira das Entidades dos Mercados Financeiro e de Capitais &quot; (&quot;Anbima&quot;). For US and Mexico bonds, fair values are the published prices by Bloomberg. Other corporate bonds and investment fund shares, the valuation of which is based on observable data, such as interest rates and interest rate curves are classified as level 2. Credit Rights Investment Funds (FIDCs) comprised of fixed rate receivables from retail customers are classified at level 3 of the fair value hierarchy with fair value calculated using the discounted cash flow model, based on the underlying assets of the fund. Derivatives: Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified as level 1 of the hierarchy. Derivatives traded on the Brazilian stock exchange are fairly valued using B3 quotations. Swaps are valued by discounting future expected cash flows to present values using interest rate curves and are classified as level 2. Total Return Swaps are also valued by discounting expected cash flows, with the particularity that the equity leg expected cash flow is the last observed price, following non-arbitrage principles. Equity instrument: For the fair value of the equity instrument, the Group used contractual conditions as inputs that are not directly observable, and therefore it is classified as level 3. Instruments eligible as capital: If the instrument has an active market, prices quoted in this market are used. Otherwise, valuation techniques are used, such as discounted cash flows, where cash flows are discounted by a risk-free rate and a credit spread. Instruments eligible as capital were designated at fair value through profit (loss) in the initial recognition (fair value option). Repurchase agreements: The fair value is calculated by discounted cash flow . d) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no material transfers of financial instruments between levels 1 and 2 or between levels 2 and 3. The table below shows a reconciliation from the opening to the closing balances for recurring fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity instrument &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; Investment funds &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Financial assets at beginning of period &nbsp; 13,199 &nbsp; 20 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 13,219 Acquisitions &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 84,186 &nbsp; 84,186 Total gains or losses &nbsp; (73) &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 1,748 &nbsp; 1,684 In profit or loss &nbsp; (73) &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 5,219 &nbsp; 5,155 In OCI &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; (3,471) &nbsp; (3,471) Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6,693) &nbsp; (6,693) Financial assets at end of period &nbsp; 13,126 &nbsp; 29 &nbsp; 79,241 &nbsp; 92,396 &nbsp; &nbsp; 61 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

INCOME TAX Current and deferred taxes are determined for all transactions that have been recognized in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the current tax laws. The current income tax expense or benefit represents the estimated taxes to be paid or refunded, respectively, for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary tax differences are expected to reverse. a) Income tax reconciliation The tax on the Group's pre-tax profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities. Thus, the following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to profit for the period, calculated by applying the combined Brazilian income tax rate of 40% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three-month period ended &nbsp; Nine-month period ended &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 09/30/2023 &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 09/30/2023 Profit before income tax &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 723,790 &nbsp; 411,545 &nbsp; 2,027,748 &nbsp; 979,151 Tax rate (i) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% Income tax &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (289,516) &nbsp; (164,618) &nbsp; (811,099) &nbsp; (391,660) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Permanent additions/exclusions &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Share-based payments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1,772) &nbsp; (4,764) &nbsp; (7,418) &nbsp; (4,969) Operational losses and others &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (73) &nbsp; (2,650) &nbsp; (8,025) &nbsp; (6,840) Effect of different tax rates - subsidiaries and parent company &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 49,249 &nbsp; 25,033 &nbsp; 102,806 &nbsp; 47,146 Interest on capital &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10,177 &nbsp; 23,965 &nbsp; 34,009 &nbsp; 23,965 Donations &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10,083 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 15,064 &nbsp; - Other amounts (ii) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51,448 &nbsp; 14,525 &nbsp; 66,387 &nbsp; 22,860 Income tax &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (170,404) &nbsp; (108,509) &nbsp; (608,276) &nbsp; (309,498) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current tax expense &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (335,468) &nbsp; (307,248) &nbsp; (1,174,519) &nbsp; (776,183) Deferred tax benefit &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 165,064 &nbsp; 198,739 &nbsp; 566,243 &nbsp; 466,685 Income tax in the statement of profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (170,404) &nbsp; (108,509) &nbsp; (608,276) &nbsp; (309,498) Deferred tax recognized in OCI &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,469 &nbsp; (6,481) &nbsp; (10,007) &nbsp; (1,892) &nbsp; &nbsp; 62 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) The tax rate used was the one applicable to the Brazilian financial subsidiaries, which represents the most significant portion of the operations of the Group. The tax rate used is not materially different from the average effective tax rate considering all jurisdictions where the Group has operations. The effect of other tax rates is shown in the table above as &#8220;effect of different tax rates &#8211; subsidiaries and parent company&#8221;. (ii) Mostly related to the amount of non-taxable income from securities, incentives and non-taxable interests on recoverable taxes. b) Deferred income taxes The following tables present significant components of the Group&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the changes for both periods. The accounting records of deferred tax assets on income tax losses and/or social contribution loss carryforwards, as well as those arising from timing differences, are based on technical feasibility studies which consider the expected generation of future taxable income, considering the history of profitability for each subsidiary individually. The use of the deferred tax asset related to tax loss and negative basis of social contribution is limited to 30% of taxable profit per year for the Brazilian entities and there is no time limit to use it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reflected in the statement of profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12/31/2023 &nbsp; Constitution &nbsp; Realization &nbsp; Foreign exchange &nbsp; Reflected in OCI &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provisions for credit losses &nbsp; 1,330,733 &nbsp; 963,968 &nbsp; (554,022) &nbsp; (165,304) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,575,375 Provision PIS/COFINS - Financial Revenue &nbsp; (2,108) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 2,108 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; - Other temporary differences (i) &nbsp; 192,070 &nbsp; 107,900 &nbsp; (8,454) &nbsp; (24,740) &nbsp; (2,206) &nbsp; 264,570 Total deferred tax assets on temporary differences &nbsp; 1,520,695 &nbsp; 1,071,868 &nbsp; (560,368) &nbsp; (190,044) &nbsp; (2,206) &nbsp; 1,839,945 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tax loss and negative basis of social contribution &nbsp; 92,918 &nbsp; 33,364 &nbsp; (7,999) &nbsp; (10,032) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 108,251 Deferred tax assets &nbsp; 1,613,613 &nbsp; 1,105,232 &nbsp; (568,367) &nbsp; (200,076) &nbsp; (2,206) &nbsp; 1,948,196 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Futures settlement market &nbsp; (11,509) &nbsp; (401) &nbsp; 2,900 &nbsp; 202 &nbsp; - &nbsp; (8,808) Fair value changes - financial instruments &nbsp; (9,332) &nbsp; (12,463) &nbsp; 359 &nbsp; 1,217 &nbsp; (280) &nbsp; (20,499) Others &nbsp; (54,937) &nbsp; (614) &nbsp; 33,130 &nbsp; 1,931 &nbsp; - &nbsp; (20,490) Deferred tax liabilities &nbsp; (75,778) &nbsp; (13,478) &nbsp; 36,389 &nbsp; 3,350 &nbsp; (280) &nbsp; (49,797) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deferred tax, offset &nbsp; 1,537,835 &nbsp; 1,091,754 &nbsp; (531,978) &nbsp; (196,726) &nbsp; (2,486) &nbsp; 1,898,399 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair value changes - cash flow hedge &nbsp; (5,375) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6,467 &nbsp; 1,054 &nbsp; (7,521) &nbsp; 2,146 Deferred tax recognized during the period &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,091,754 &nbsp; (525,511) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (10,007) &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) Other temporary differences are composed mainly of other provisions and supplier provisions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 63 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISKS, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND OTHER RISKS Overview The Group monitors all the risks that could have a material impact on its strategic objectives, including those that must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To efficiently manage and mitigate these risks, the risk management structure conducts risk identification and assessment to prioritize the risks that are key when pursuing potential opportunities and/or that may prevent value from being created or that may compromise existing value, with the possibility of impacting financial results, capital, liquidity, customer relationships and reputation. Risks that are actively monitored include Credit, Liquidity, Market, Foreign exchange (FX), Operational, IT and Cyber, Regulatory, Compliance and AML (Anti-money laundering) and Reputational Risk, Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and Risk from Cryptocurrency business. Nu considers Risk Management an important pillar of the Group's strategic management. The risk management structure broadly permeates the entire Group, with the objective of ensuring that risks are properly identified, measured, mitigated, monitored and reported, in order to support the development of its activities. Risk Management is related to the principles, culture, structures and processes to improve the decision-making process and the achievement of strategic objectives. It is a continuous and evolving process that runs through Nu's entire strategy, to support Management in minimizing its losses, as well as maximizing its profits and underscoring the Group's values. The Group's risk management structure considers the size and complexity of its business, which allows tracking, monitoring and control of the risks to which it is exposed. The risk management process is aligned with management guidelines, which, through committees and other internal meetings, define strategic objectives, including risk appetite. Conversely, the capital control and capital management units provide support through risk and capital monitoring and analysis processes. &nbsp; 68 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; The Group considers a risk appetite statement (&#8220;RAS&#8221;) to be an essential instrument to support risk management and decision making. The Board reviews and approves the RAS, as guidelines and limits for the business plan and capital deployment. Nu has defined a RAS (aligned to local regulatory requirements) that prioritizes the main risks and, for each of these, qualitative statements and quantitative metrics expressed in relation to earnings, capital, risk measures, liquidity and other relevant measures were implemented, as appropriate. Each of the risks described below has its own methodologies, systems and processes for its identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation. In the case of financial risks, such as credit, liquidity, IRRBB and market risk, the measurement is carried out based on quantitative models and, in certain cases, prospective scenarios in relation to the main variables involved, respecting the applicable regulatory requirements and best market practices. Non-financial risks, such as operational risk and technological/cyber risks, are measured using impact criteria (inherent risk), considering potential financial losses, reputational damage, customer perception and legal/regulatory obligations, as well as evaluated in relation to the effectiveness of the respective structure of internal controls. There were no significant changes to the risk management structure that was reported in Annual Financial Statements. Credit risk The Group&#8217;s outstanding balance of financial assets and other exposures to credit risk is shown in the table below: &nbsp; &nbsp; 09/30/2024 &nbsp; 12/31/2023 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Financial assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp; 7,645,754 &nbsp; 5,923,440 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 119,281 &nbsp; 368,574 Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 195,272 &nbsp; 20,981 Collateral for credit card operations &nbsp; 332 &nbsp; 320 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; 314,885 &nbsp; 389,875 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 11,019,200 &nbsp; 8,805,745 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income &nbsp; 11,019,200 &nbsp; 8,805,745 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card receivables &nbsp; 12,689,210 &nbsp; 12,414,133 Loans to customers &nbsp; 4,939,376 &nbsp; 3,202,334 Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &nbsp; 6,800,215 &nbsp; 7,447,483 Other receivables &nbsp; 971,286 &nbsp; 1,689,030 Other financial assets &nbsp; 180,827 &nbsp; 131,519 Securities &nbsp; 659,664 &nbsp; 104,420 Financial assets at amortized cost &nbsp; 26,240,578 &nbsp; 24,988,919 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other exposures &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unused limits (i) &nbsp; 18,936,274 &nbsp; 16,998,572 Credit Commitments &nbsp; 18,936,274 &nbsp; 16,998,572 &nbsp; 69 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024 &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) Unused limits are not recorded in the statement of financial position but are considered in the measurement of the ECL because it represents credit risk exposure. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as: &#9679; the ability of an entity to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses; and &#9679; the possibility of not being able to easily exit a financial position due to its size compared to the traded volume in the market. The liquidity risk management structure uses future cash flow data, applying what Nu believes to be a severe stress scenario to these cash flows, in order to measure that the volume of high-quality liquid assets that the Group has is sufficient to guarantee its resilience even in very adverse situations. The liquidity indicators are monitored daily. For funding risk management, the gaps between assets and liabilities in term buckets are monitored to assure that the profile of assets is consistent with the liabilities. &nbsp; The Group has a Contingency Funding Plan for the Brazilian entities that describes possible management actions that should be taken in the event of a deterioration of the liquidity indicators.

(ii) Considering the earliest date in which the customer can withdraw the deposit. The expected redemption rate for Nu's deposits, used within the previously described liquidity risk management framework is estimated based on observed historic customer behavior. &nbsp; (iii) The total was projected considering the exchange rate of Brazilian Reais, Mexican and Colombian Pesos to US$ as of September 30, 2024. The unused limit of credit cards is the pre-approved limit that has not yet been used by the customer and represents the current maximum potential credit exposure. Therefore, it does not represent the real need for liquidity arising from commitments. When customers begin utilizing their unused limits, the duration of the credit card receivables are expected to be shorter than the duration of the payables to network.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the entities of the Group had significant financial instruments in a currency other than their respective functional currencies. Certain costs in US Dollars and Euros, or intercompany loans in US Dollars, are hedged with FX derivatives based on projections of these costs, or when there are new exposures. Hedge transactions are adjusted when internal cost projections change and when the FX derivatives expire. &nbsp; &nbsp; 72 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The purpose of capital management is to maintain the capital adequacy for Nu's operation through control and monitoring of the capital position, to evaluate the capital necessity according to the risk appetite and strategic aim of the organization, and to establish a capital planning process following future requirements of regulatory capital, based on the Group's growth projections, risk exposure, market movements, and other relevant information. Also, the capital management structure is responsible for identifying sources of capital, writing and submitting the capital plan and the capital contingency plan for approval by the Executive Directors. Regulatory Capital Composition a) Nu Prudential Conglomerate in Brazil Brazil's Central bank defines a prudential conglomerate as a group of companies in which one regulated entity controls other regulated companies or investment funds. The conglomerate is classified as Type 3 when the regulated company that leads the conglomerate is a Payment Institution, which is the case of Nu Pagamentos. &nbsp; The regulatory capital of the prudential conglomerate, defined by Brazil's Central Bank, consists of three key components: &#9679; Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: Consisting of paid-in capital, reserves, and retained earnings, after accounting for deductions and prudential adjustments. &#9679; Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital: This includes debt instruments that have no specific maturity and can absorb losses, meeting the eligibility criteria set out by the Central Bank. The sum of CET1 and AT1 forms the overall Tier 1 Capital. &#9679; Tier II Capital: This involves subordinated debt instruments with set maturity dates that meet eligibility requirements. Type 3 institutions are required to implement capital rules as a prudential conglomerate. This implementation includes a phase-in rule for minimum capital requirements and prudential adjustments up to December 2024. Transitional rules are currently in effect and are outlined in the table below. The figures for 2025 represent the final implementation requirements. &nbsp; &nbsp; Full year Transitional Rule &nbsp; 2024 &nbsp; 2025 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prudential Adjustments &nbsp; 60.0% &nbsp; 100.0% Minimum CET1 (Including Buffers) (i) &nbsp; 5.75% &nbsp; 7.00% Tier 1 Capital (Including Buffers) (i) &nbsp; 7.25% &nbsp; 8.50% Conservation Capital Buffer (CCB) &nbsp; 1.25% &nbsp; 2.50% Total Requirement &nbsp; 8.75% &nbsp; 10.50% (i) Consider the baseline regulatory minimum plus any additional buffers as required by Brazil's Central Bank regulations. &nbsp; &nbsp; 73 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.

OTHER TRANSACTIONS a) Accounting for crypto-assets - Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&quot;SAB 121&quot;) In March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) released Staff Accounting Bulletin (&quot;SAB&quot;) 121, which addresses the rights and obligations of the parties to a crypto asset safeguarding arrangement. SAB 121 explains that an issuer that has obligations to safeguard digital assets held for their platform users should recognize those digital assets as an asset and a liability to return to the customers, both of which are measured at fair value. In June 2022, the Group launched a platform, through its subsidiary Nu Crypto Ltda. (&quot;Nu Crypto&quot;), which allows customers to trade crypto assets, in partnership with specialized brokers. The custody activity is performed by the brokers, which hold the cryptographic key information, and the Company's contractual arrangements state that its customers retain legal ownership of the crypto; have the right to sell or transfer the crypto assets; and also benefit from the rewards and bear the risks associated with the ownership, including as a result of any crypto price fluctuations. The Group maintains an internal recordkeeping of the crypto assets held for the customers. &nbsp; 75 &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd.
