(NYSE: JPM) today reported third- quarter 2009 net income of $3.6 billion, compared with net income of $527 million in the third quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.82, compared with $0.09 in the prior year. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Our net income of $3.6 billion in the quarter reflected the strong earnings power of the company, with broad-base d growth across the Investment Bank, Asset Ma nagement, Commercial Banking an d Retail Banking. However, credit costs remain high and are expected to st ay elevated for the foreseeable future in the Consumer Lending and Card Services loan portfolios. Accordingly, we have added $2.0 billion to our consumer credit reserves, bringing the firmwide total to $31.5 billion, or 5.3% 1 of total loans. Tier 1 Common Capital, another key element of our fortress balance sheet, was also strengthened through capital generation during the quarter, to $101 billion, or 8.2%.” Dimon further remarked: “JPMorgan Chase continue s to help consumers and communities in this challenging economy. We recently announced the deci sion to revamp our overdraft policies to make it easier for customers to have more control over the fees they pay. In addition, our Card Services business has developed new innovative products that enhance the way customers manage their spending and borrowing. We are also aiding communities by work ing with struggling mortgage customers to modify their loans. We have approved more than 262,000 new trial modifications under the U.S. Making Home Affordable Progr am and our own modification program, nearly 90% of which include a reducti on in payments for the homeowner. Since 2007, we have helped families by initiating 782,000 ac tions to prevent foreclosure, and we are committed to doing our part to support economic recovery going forward.” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Discussing the firm’s outlook, Dimon concluded: “While we are seeing some initial signs of consumer credit stability, we are not yet certain that this trend will continue. Despite this near-term uncertainty about the path of the economy, ou r strong capital position and underlying earnings power will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses, creating a lasting franchise for many years to come.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

These results included the negative impact of the tight ening of the firm’s credit spread, offset by the positive impact of counterparty spread tightening and gains on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related positions. Net revenue was $7.5 billion, an in crease of $3.4 billion, or 85%, from the prior year. Investment banking fees were up 4% to $1.7 billion, consisting of equity underwriting fees of $681 million (up 31%), debt underwriting fees of $593 million (up 19%) and advisory fees of $384 million (down 33%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, up by $4.2 billion, reflecting strong results across most products and gains of approximate ly $400 million on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage-related positions, compared with mar kdowns of $3.6 billion in the prior year. These results also included losses of $497 million from the tightening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, compared with gains of $343 million in th e prior year from the widening of the spread on those liabilities. Equity Markets revenue was $941 million, down by $709 million, or 43%, which included losses of $343 million from the tightening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, compared with gains in the prior year of $429 million from the widening of the spread on those liabilities. The current period’s results also included solid client revenue, particularly in prime services, and strong trading results. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $102 million, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of reta ined loans, largely offset by a combination of the positive net imp act of credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities, and net interest income on loans. The provision for credit losses increased to $379 million, compared with $234 million in the prior year. The increase in the provision reflected higher charge-offs of $750 million, partially offset by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 a reduction of $371 million in the allowance for cr edit losses. The resulting allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 8. 44%, compared with 3.62% in the prior year.

Compared with the prio r quarter, net income decreased by $8 million, reflecting a decrease in mortgage production revenue, an increase in the provision for credit losses, higher noninterest expense and lower loan balances; these effects were largely offset by positive MSR risk management results and wider loan and deposit spreads. Net revenue was $8.2 billion, an increase of $3.3 bil lion, or 66%, from the pr ior year. Net interest income was $5.2 billion, up by $1.9 billion, or 60%, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan sp reads and higher deposi t balances offset pa rtially by lower loan balances.

The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion from the prior year. Weak economic conditions and housing price declin es continued to drive higher estimated losses for the home equity and mortgage loan portfolios. The provision included an add ition of $1.4 billion to the allowance for loan losses, compared with additions of $730 million in the prior year J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 and $1.2 billion in the prior quarter.

Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by $73 million, or 8%, due to a decline in the provision for credit losses, wide r deposit spreads and hi gher deposit-related fees; these were offset largely by higher noninterest expense and lower deposit balances. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, up by $1.7 billion, or 61%, from the prior year. The increase reflected the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees and wider deposit spreads.

Discussion of Results: Card Services reported a net loss of $700 million, a decline of $992 million from the third quarter of 2008. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue. End-of-period managed loans were $165.2 billion, a decrease of $21.3 billion, or 11%, from the prior year and $6.3 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year was due to lower charge volume and a higher level of charge-offs.

The increase was driven by higher merc hant servicing revenue related to the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP ba sis was $26,622 million, $25,623 million, and $14,737 million for the third quarter of 2009, second quarter of 2009 and third quarter of 2008, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $3.6 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2008. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, partially offset by increases to both the provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of $12.7 billion, or 79%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.0 billion, up by $8.7 bill ion, or 167%. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions, primarily related to the absence of markdow ns on legacy leveraged lending and mortgage positions and strong trading results in the Investment Bank, as well as higher investment portfolio trading income in Corporate. These results also benefited from the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Net intere st income was $14.8 billion, up by $3.9 billion, or 36%, due to the impact of Washington Mutual, wide r loan spreads and higher investment portfolio net interest income. The managed provision for credit losses was $9.8 billion, up by $3.1 billion, or 47%, from the prior year. The consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $9.0 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in the prior year, refl ecting higher net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses in the home lending and credit card loan portfolios. Consumer-managed net charge- offs were $7.0 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 6.29% and 3.39%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $779 million, compared with $962 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected higher net charge-offs, partially offset by a reduction in allowance in the Investment Bank. Wholesale net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, compared with $52 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.93% and 0.10%, respectively. The firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $20.4 billion at September 30, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $9.5 billion. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion, up by $2.3 billion, or 21%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Wash ington Mutual transaction and higher performance- based compensation expense, partially offset by lower headcount-related expense 1.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 1. Notes on financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, wh ich is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments. First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for cr edit losses, net charge-offs a nd loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold still remain on the balance sheet, and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concep t of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of th e entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performa nce will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Ac cordingly, revenue from tax-exempt s ecurities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basi s comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. b. The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impa ired loans; the allowance for loan losses related to purchased credit-impaired loans; and, loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Consumer Lending net charge- off rates exclude the impact of purc hased credit-impaired loans. The allo wance related to the purchased credit- impaired portfolio was $1.1 billion at September 30, 2009. c. Tier 1 Common Capital (“Tier 1 Common ”) is calculated, for all purposes, as Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits, and other noncompensation costs related to employees. e. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

(e) The calculation of second quarter 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction the adjusted ROE and ROTCE were 6% and 10% for the second quarter 2009, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because it increases the comparability to prior periods. related deferred tax liabilities.
