(NYSE: JP M) today reported second-quarter 2009 net income of $2.7 billion, an increase of 36% compared with net income of $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.28, compared with $0.53 in the second quarter of 2008. Current-quarter earnings per shar e reflected a one-time, non-cash reduction in net income applicable to common stockholders of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the results: “We are pleased that, despite a continued difficult economic envir onment, we were able to report $2.7 billion in earnings and record revenue of almost $28 billion. Of part icular note, the Investment Bank reported record overall revenue for the first half of the year, which included record fees and Fixed Income Markets revenue for this quarter. In addition, Commercial Ba nking, Asset Management, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Treasury & Securities Services and Retail Ba nking each delivered another quarter of solid performance. These results were negatively affected by the continued high levels of credit costs in Consumer Lending and Card Services, which we exp ect will remain elevated for the foreseeable future.” Regarding balance sheet strength , Dimon added: “Even after furt her strengthening our credit reserves by $2 billion to $30 billion and repaying the $25 billion of TARP capital, the firm ended the quarter with a very strong Tier 1 Capital ra tio of 9.7% and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 7.7%. With these additions to reserves, we now have an extremely high loan loss coverage ratio of 5%.” Dimon further remarked: “Throughout this crisis, we have remained committed to doing our part to help bring stability to the communities in which we operate and to the financial system overall. During the quarter, we maintained our efforts to support economic recovery and to help keep people in their homes. We contin ued to lend, extending approxima tely $150 billion in new credit to consumer and corporate customers. We approved 138,000 trial mortgage modifications, bringing total foreclosures prev ented since 2007 to 565,000 – a number we expect to continue to grow.” Commenting on the second half of 2009, Dimon c oncluded: “While we do not know if the economy will deteriorate further, we feel confident that, with our strong cap ital and reserve levels and significant earnings power, we can continue to reinvest in our businesses and do well for our clients, communities and shareholders over the long term.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

The results reflected higher net revenue and lower nonint erest expense, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $7.3 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from the prior year. Investment banking fees were up 29% to a record $2.2 billion and co mprised the following: advisory fees, up 6% to $393 million; equity underwriting fees, up by $561 million to a record $1.1 billion; and debt J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 underwriting fees, down 10% to $743 million. Fixe d Income Markets revenue was a record $4.9 billion, up by $2.6 billion from the prior year, driven by strong results across all products, as well as the absence of markdowns related to leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments and mortgage-related exposure. The current period had modest gain s on those exposures, compared with losses totaling $1.1 billion in the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was offset partially by losses of $773 million from the tight ening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Equity Markets revenue was $708 million, down by $371 million, or 34%, reflecting weak trading results and losses of $326 million from the tightening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liab ilities, offset by str ong client revenue, particularly in prime services. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $575 million, down by $914 million, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of retained loan s, partially offset by th e net impact of credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities and net interest income on loans. The provision for credit losses was $871 million, co mpared with $398 million in the prior year, due to higher charge-offs, as well as a higher a llowance reflecting continued deterioration in the credit environment. Net charge-offs were $433 million, while the increase to the allowance for loan losses was $438 million. The resulting allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 7.91%, compared with 3.44% in th e prior year.

A higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense were offset partially by higher net revenue, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mu tual transaction. Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $459 million, or 97%, reflecting a decline in MSR risk management results, narrower loan spreads and lo wer loan balances; these effects were offset J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 partially by higher deposit- relate d fees, efficiencies related to the Washington Mutual transaction and wider deposit spreads. Net revenue was $8.0 billion, an increase of $2.9 bil lion, or 56%, from the pr ior year.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $955 million, co mpared with a net loss of $171 million in the prior year and $389 million in the prior quarter. Compared with the prior quarter, results reflected a decline in MSR risk management resu lts, narrower loan spreads, lower loan balances and an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previ ously-sold loans, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $3.4 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 45%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Wash ington Mutual transaction and wide r loan spreads, largely offset by lower loan balances in the heritage Chase portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income increased due to higher net mortga ge servicing revenue, partially o ffset by a decline in mortgage production revenue. Mortgage production revenue was $284 million, down $110 million from the prior year, as an increase in reserves for the repurchase of previously-sold loans and markdowns on the mortgage warehouse were offset partially by wider margins on new originations.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP ba sis was $25,623 million, $25,025 million, and $18,399 million for the second quarter of 2009, first quarter of 2009 and second quarter of 2008, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $2.7 billion, an increase of $718 million, or 36%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net re venue, predominantly offset by a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $27.7 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 41%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 bill ion, up by $3.5 billion, or 37%. The increase was driven by higher principal transactions, higher lending- and deposit-related fees, and record Investment Banking fees; these were offset partially by the effect of lowe r market levels on fees and commission revenue. Net interest income was $1 4.7 billion, up by $4.5 billion, or 45%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads and higher investment- and trading-related net interest income. The managed provision for credit losses was $9.7 billion, up by $5.4 billion, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for cr edit losses was $8.5 billi on, compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year, reflect ing higher net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for credit losses, largely related to home lendi ng. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $7.0 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 6.18%2 and 3.08%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, compared with $505 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses, largely in the Investment Bank. Wholes ale net charge-offs were $679 million, compared with net charge-offs of $41 million in the prior y ear, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.19% and 0.08%, respectively. The firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $17.5 billion at June 30, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $6.2 billion. Noninterest expense was $13.5 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or 11%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Wash ington Mutual transactio n, a $675 million (pretax) FDIC special assessment and higher FDIC insurance premiums. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, wh ich is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments. First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for cr edit losses, net charge-offs a nd loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations ar e funded and decisions are made about al locating resources, such as employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In add ition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on th e balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both th e credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Ac cordingly, revenue from tax-exempt s ecurities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basi s comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financ ial Supplement (second quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. b. Tier 1 Common Capital (“Tier 1 Common ”) is calculated, for all purposes, as Tier 1 Capital less qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, and qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries. c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. 2. Coverage Ratio: Allowance for loan losses to en d-of-period loans excludes purch ased credit-impaired loans and loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm’s balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. No allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at June 30, 2009. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

For further discussion of this FSP, see page 36 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (c) The calculation of second quarter 2009 earnings per share includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion, or $0.27 per share, resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. (d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (e) The calculation of second quarter and year-to-date 2009 net income applicable to common equity includes a one-time, non-cash reduction of $1.1 billion resulting from repayment of TARP preferred capital. Excluding this reduction the adjusted ROE and ROE-GW were 6% and 10% for the second quarter 2009 , respectively, and 6% and 9% for the year-to-date, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROE-GW, non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because it increases the comparability to prior periods. (f) Net income applicable to common equity divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm. The Firm utilizes this measure to facilitate comparisons to competitors.
