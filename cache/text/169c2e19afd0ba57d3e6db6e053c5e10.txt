Highlights of our financial results include: &bull; Increased year-over-year revenue to $33,203 million, 21% above our fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 (&ldquo;Fiscal Year 2021&rdquo;). &bull; Increased GAAP operating income to $14,225 million, 67% above Fiscal Year 2021; and increased non-GAAP operating income* to $20,294 million, 28% above Fiscal Year 2021. &bull; Increased net cash provided by operating activities to $16,736 million, 22% above Fiscal Year 2021; and increased free cash flow* to $16,312 million, 22% above Fiscal Year 2021. Revenue (in billions) Operating Income (in billions) Free Cash Flow (in billions) * See Appendix A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Return of Capital to Stockholders Our strong cash flow in Fiscal Year 2021 enabled us to return an aggregate of $14,032 million to our stockholders during Fiscal Year 2022, consisting of $7,032 million in cash dividends and $7,000 million under our stock repurchase program. We also paid $1,455 million for the elimination of shares withheld to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. In addition, our strong free cash flow in Fiscal Year 2022 enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $4.60 per share in our first quarter of fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 (&ldquo;Fiscal Year 2023&rdquo;), an increase of 12% over the quarterly dividend paid in Fiscal Year 2022. Dividends Broadcom Inc. 3 &nbsp; Table of Contents PROXY SUMMARY &nbsp; Total Stockholder Return We believe long-term total stockholder return (&ldquo;TSR&rdquo;) is a meaningful measure, as our stock price over short periods is frequently impacted by market volatility and macroeconomic events unrelated to our underlying performance. Our five-year TSR performance, based on an investment of $100 in Broadcom common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal year 2017 and assuming reinvestment of dividends, has been substantial on both an absolute and relative basis, returning $222 on a $100 investment. Although our one-year TSR decreased in Fiscal Year 2022 due to broader market volatility, we still outperformed our peer group median and the S&amp;P 500 as shown below. Cumulative TSR Our one-, three- and five-year TSR outperformed our peer group median and the S&amp;P 500 Index. Our TSR increased by 21.1% annually on average over the past three fiscal years and by 17.3% annually on average over the past five fiscal years. We significantly increased our absolute TSR since our initial public offering in 2009 by over 3,700% , with an annual average increase of 31.8% . Executive Compensation Executive Compensation Program Governance Our executive compensation program is designed to reward our executive officers for producing sustainable growth in share value, to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, and to attract and retain top talent. The table below highlights our key executive compensation program governance practices. &nbsp; Best Practices We Employ &nbsp; Practices We Do Not Employ &#252; Majority of named executive officer compensation tied to long-term performance X No excessive risk taking in incentive plan design &#252; Performance metrics directly tied to value creation for stockholders X No re-pricing of underwater stock options without stockholder approval &#252; Caps on cash and equity incentive plan payouts &nbsp; X No excise tax gross-ups &#252; Annual risk assessment of compensation programs &nbsp; X No supplemental retirement or pension benefits &#252; Engagement of an independent compensation consultant X No guaranteed bonuses &#252; CEO compensation reviewed and approved by the independent directors X No &ldquo;single trigger&rdquo; change in control payments or benefits &#252; Robust stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors X No hedging or pledging of stock by employees and directors &nbsp; 4 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROXY SUMMARY &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2022 Named Executive Officer Pay Mix The following charts compare the Fiscal Year 2022 target total direct compensation for our CEO and our other named executive officers (&ldquo;NEOs&rdquo;), except for Mr. Krause who resigned in July 2022. Mr. Krause did not receive any severance or bonus payments and forfeited all outstanding, unvested equity awards in connection with his resignation. Target total direct compensation consists of (i) base salary, (ii) target short-term incentives (&ldquo;STI&rdquo;) through our annual performance cash bonus plan (the &ldquo;APB Plan&rdquo;) and (iii) target long-term incentives (&ldquo;LTI&rdquo;) in the form of equity awards comprised of service-based restricted stock unit (&ldquo;RSU&rdquo;) awards and performance-based stock unit (&ldquo;PSU&rdquo;) awards based on the fair market value of the awards on the grant date, assuming target performance, as applicable. The Average Other NEO chart also includes the portion of the multi-year equity awards of RSU awards (the &ldquo;RSU Multi-Year&nbsp;Awards&rdquo;) and PSU awards (the &ldquo;PSU Multi-Year Awards&rdquo;) granted to our NEOs in January 2019 (the &ldquo;2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards&rdquo;) that began vesting in March 2022, based on the fair market value on the January 2019 grant date and assuming target performance. The 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards vest on the same basis as if four annual equity grants were made on March 15 each year, beginning in 2019 for four successive years. CEO FY 2022 Target Pay Mix Average Other NEO FY 2022 Target Pay Mix Broadcom Inc. 5 &nbsp; Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE &nbsp; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Code of Ethics and Business Conduct We are committed to strong corporate governance. Our Board has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the &ldquo;Code of Ethics&rdquo;) that is applicable to all members of our Board, employees, including our President and CEO, our Chief Financial Officer (&ldquo;CFO&rdquo;), and contractors. The Code of Ethics guides us in how we conduct our business and work with each other, and reflects our values, standards and expectations. Any amendments to or waivers given to our executive officers or directors under the Code of Ethics will be disclosed on our website to the extent required under the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) rules. A copy of the Code of Ethics is available in the &ldquo;Investor Center&mdash;Corporate Governance&mdash;Documents&rdquo; section of our website or upon request to: Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc., 1320 Ridder Park Drive, San Jose, California 95131. Corporate Governance Guidelines Our Board has adopted the Corporate Governance Guidelines that cover various topics relating to our Board and its activities. A copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is available in the &ldquo;Investor Center&mdash;Corporate Governance&mdash;Documents&rdquo; section of our website or upon request to: Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc., 1320 Ridder Park Drive, San Jose, California 95131. Some of the governance best practices included in the Corporate Governance Guidelines are as follows: &bull; Protections Against Overboarding To ensure that our directors are not over-committed and have sufficient time to fulfill their duties and responsibilities on our Board effectively, directors may not serve on more than four other public company boards without prior approval, except that a director who also serves as the chief executive officer of a public company should not serve on more than two public company boards in addition to our Board. The Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (the &ldquo;NESG Committee&rdquo;) regularly reviews the commitment of our directors, including the number of other public company directorships. When considering any requests to serve on additional public company boards, our Board, with the NESG Committee, carefully reviews such director&rsquo;s prior time and attention to our Board and ability to continue to dedicate sufficient time to fulfill the responsibilities required as a member of our Board. Our Board also considers such directors&rsquo; contributions to our Board, our full Board&rsquo;s skill and diversity composition and whether such director&rsquo;s service with the other public company boards will impact service on our Board and committees on which the director is a member, including if the other public company is a special purpose acquisition company. &bull; Resignation Offered with Significant Job Change Any director who retires from or terminates his or her present employment, or who materially changes his or her position, is required to submit an offer of resignation as a director of our Board. This provides our Board the opportunity to evaluate whether the individual should continue to sit on our Board in light of the director&rsquo;s new occupational status. Our Board may invite any such director to remain a director if our Board determines that continued access to such director&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and experience is in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. &bull; Resignation Offered at Age 75 Longer serving directors have valuable insight about our business, operations, history, policies and objectives. Our Board does not currently believe that a mandatory retirement age for non-employee directors is necessary, and that continued service by a particular director may be in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. However, when a non-employee director reaches the age of 75 years, the director is required to offer such director&rsquo;s resignation to our Board, to be effective as of the next annual meeting of stockholders. This allows our Board to evaluate the composition and needs of our Board and determine whether continued service of such director is in the best interests of Broadcom and our stockholders. &nbsp; 6 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE &nbsp; Stock Ownership Guidelines Based on competitive market data and after consultation with the Compensation Committee&rsquo;s independent compensation consultant, the stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and executive officers are as follows: Position Aggregate Value* Non-employee Director 5x annual cash retainer CEO 6x base salary Executive Officer 3x base salary &nbsp; *Fair market value of common stock based on the closing price per share as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of valuation. Our non-employee directors and executive officers are expected to satisfy the applicable guidelines within five years of the date on which they become a director or an executive officer and to hold at least such minimum value in shares of common stock while they remain a director or an executive officer. Shares held in a trust or other estate-planning vehicle established by a non-employee director or an executive officer, which they beneficially own under SEC rules, count toward achieving the applicable level of stock ownership. Outstanding RSU and PSU awards for which the performance criteria have been met count toward achieving the applicable level of stock ownership at a rate of 100%. Shares subject to outstanding stock options awards do not count towards achieving the applicable stock ownership level. As of the Record Date, all of our non-employee directors and executive officers have met the level of stock ownership set forth under the guidelines. Anti-Hedging and Trading Restrictions Our insider trading policy prohibits our directors and employees, including our executive officers, from hedging or pledging our securities, making short sales or trading in derivative securities related to our securities. CEO and Senior Management Succession Planning Our Board is actively involved in the CEO and senior management succession planning. Our Board discusses CEO succession planning at least bi-annually. Our Board has developed an interim and a longer-term CEO succession plan. The interim plan would utilize internal candidates and become effective in the event our CEO unexpectedly becomes unable to perform his duties, in order to minimize potential disruption or loss of continuity to the business and operations. The longer-term CEO succession plan is currently focused on the development of internal candidates, as well as on maintaining business and operational continuity. In addition, our Board, with our CEO and Vice President of Human Resources, regularly discuss senior management succession planning and review the composition of senior management. Our Board reviews the qualifications and experience of the potential successors and the development priorities and achievements of the potential successors, and our Board engages with the potential internal successors at least annually at Board meetings and in less formal settings. Corporate Social Responsibility Our Board, through the NESG Committee, oversees our environment, climate, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance (&ldquo;ESG&rdquo;) matters, including our corporate social responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives. The NESG Committee receives quarterly updates from management on ESG matters and regularly updates the Board. Broadcom Inc. 7 &nbsp; Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE &nbsp; In February 2023, we published our annual Environmental, Social and Governance Report for Fiscal Year 2022 (the &ldquo;ESG Report&rdquo;). In the ESG Report, we discuss our Fiscal Year 2022 ESG program and initiatives, including our products that help our customers with sustainability, our human rights program within our supply chain, our talented and dedicated workforce, and our environmental impact. We also disclosed in the ESG Report our goal to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in line with the UN Paris Agreement and Science Based Targets Initiative goal to limit global warming to 1.5&ordm; Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We prepared the ESG Report leveraging the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (core option), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Semiconductors and Software &amp; IT Services Industry Standards and the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The ESG Report is also reviewed by the full Board. Additional information about our corporate social responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives is in the ESG Report, which is located in the Citizenship and the Investor Center sections of our website. The ESG Report and our website are not part of or incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement. Stockholder Engagement We recognize the importance of actively engaging with and understanding the concerns of our stockholders. Our Board and executive officers value the input from our stockholders. Our Lead Independent Director and chairperson of the Compensation Committee, together with members of management, annually engage with our stockholders in a robust stockholder engagement program. In Fiscal Year 2022, we contacted stockholders beneficially owning over 50% of our then outstanding shares of common stock and engaged with stockholders owning approximately 49% of our then outstanding stock. Our Lead Independent Director and chairperson of the Compensation Committee, along with members of management, participated in these engagements and discussed a variety of topics, including board composition, risk management, corporate governance, ESG initiatives, corporate social responsibility, executive compensation and succession planning. We continued to meet with our stockholders into Fiscal Year 2023 to discuss the progress of our ESG priorities and corporate social responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives. Stockholder Communications with our Board You may communicate with our Board at the following address: Board of Directors Broadcom Inc. c/o Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer 1320 Ridder Park Drive San Jose, California 95131 Communications are distributed to our Board or to any individual director, as appropriate, depending on the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication. Communications that are unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable will be excluded, but will be made available to any director upon request. &nbsp; 8 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board oversees the conduct of our business by senior management and risk management, provides guidance on strategic and business planning, is principally responsible for the succession planning for our CEO and senior management, and ensures that the long-term interests of stockholders are being served. Director Independence Our Board annually reviews the independence of each director and nominee and considers whether such individual has a material relationship with Broadcom that could compromise their ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. For the purpose of assessing a director&rsquo;s independence, our Board reviewed transactions and relationships between Broadcom and an entity where a director or nominee serves as a director and/or is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of such entity, or where a director or nominee for director serves on a non-employee advisory board of, or in a non-employee advisory capacity to, such an entity. While Dr. Samueli is considered independent under the Nasdaq Stock Market (&ldquo;Nasdaq&rdquo;) listing standards, Dr. Samueli would not be deemed independent until December 2023 under Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis proxy voting policies. Accordingly, our Board has determined that Mses. Bryant, Delly and Page, and Messrs. Fernandez, Hartenstein, Low and You, representing seven of our nine director nominees, are currently &ldquo;independent directors.&rdquo; Board Leadership Structure Our Board currently believes that Broadcom and its stockholders are best served by a Board leadership structure in which the roles of the CEO and the Chairman of the Board are held by different individuals, and that there be a Lead Independent Director if the Chairman is not independent. Under this structure our CEO is generally responsible for setting the strategic direction of Broadcom and for the day-to-day management of our operations. The independent Chairman or the Lead Independent Director, as applicable, provides strong independent leadership to assist our Board in fulfilling its oversight role of management and our risk management practices, approves the agenda for Board meetings and presides over Board meetings and over the meetings of our independent directors in executive session. Our Board annually reviews its leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve Broadcom and its stockholders. Currently, Mr. Tan serves as our President and CEO, Dr. Samueli serves as our Chairman of the Board and Mr. Hartenstein serves as our Lead Independent Director. Our Board has decided to maintain the current leadership structure and division of responsibilities. Director Nominations In accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board seeks individuals to serve as directors who have the highest personal and professional integrity, strength of character, demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment, and diversity of skills, experience and background appropriate for the business and operations of Broadcom. When evaluating director candidates, the NESG Committee seeks to ensure that our Board has the requisite skills, experience and expertise, and that our Board consist of persons with appropriately diverse and independent backgrounds. The NESG Committee will consider all aspects of a candidate&rsquo;s qualifications in the context of the needs of Broadcom, including: &bull; personal and professional integrity, ethics and values &bull; experience as an officer in corporate management &bull; experience and expertise in our industries and international business and familiarity with Broadcom &bull; experience as a board member of another public company Broadcom Inc. 9 &nbsp; Table of Contents BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &bull; practical and mature business judgment &bull; diversity of background and perspective (including age, ethnicity, race, experience, gender and education) &bull; Board size and composition and the extent to which a candidate would fill a present need on our Board &bull; other ongoing commitments and obligations of the candidate &bull; independence from management The NESG Committee will consider nominee recommendations from its members, other Board members and members of our management, as well as nominees recommended by our stockholders. The NESG Committee has from time to time also engaged third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating possible candidates. See &ldquo; Other Information &ndash; Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for the 2024 Annual Meeting &rdquo; below for information on the requirements for director nominations, including nominations using proxy access. Director Attendance and Meetings The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that each director is expected to attend all meetings of our Board and of each committee on which the director is a member and the annual meetings of stockholders. Our Board held 10 meetings during Fiscal Year 2022 and our independent directors met at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management present. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of our Board and all committees of our Board on which the director served during Fiscal Year 2022. All of our directors attended the annual meeting of stockholders in April 2022. Board Risk Oversight Our Board believes that evaluating Broadcom&rsquo;s most critical risks is one of its most important areas of oversight. Our Board regularly reviews and discusses with management risks related to operations, liquidity, credit, cybersecurity, climate, compensation programs, workforce retention and senior management succession. In addition, each committee is responsible for the oversight of specific areas of risk and reports regularly to our Board on matters relating to those risks. Management reports, at least annually, on our risks and risk management practices to the relevant committees and the full Board. Committee Primary Areas of Risk Oversight Audit &bull; Oversee financial reporting process, accounting policies and internal controls &nbsp; &bull; Evaluate risks related to financial reporting, accounting, auditing, tax and fraud &nbsp; &bull; Evaluate exposures and risks related to cybersecurity, data privacy and information technology security and controls, including our cybersecurity performance and risk profile, and the steps management takes to monitor and report such exposure &nbsp; &bull; Review and approve related party transactions Compensation &bull; Oversee compensation plans, program and policies &nbsp; &bull; Evaluate the relationship between risk management policies and practices, business strategy and officers&rsquo; compensation &nbsp; &bull; Evaluate and provide input on CEO and senior management succession planning NESG &bull; Review and evaluate the corporate governance framework, including governance guidelines and policies &nbsp; &bull; Evaluate the structure and composition of our Board and committees, including succession planning, diversity, and related policies and procedures &nbsp; &bull; Oversee corporate responsibility and sustainability program and initiatives, including environment, climate, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance matters &nbsp; 10 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; Cybersecurity Risk Management Our Board is actively involved in overseeing our cybersecurity, data privacy and information technology risk management. Our management, including our Chief Security Officer, reviews with the Audit Committee at least quarterly our cybersecurity, data privacy and information technology security policies, practices and protective measures, current and projected threats to our data privacy and information security, cybersecurity incidents and related risks. The Audit Committee and management also update our Board at least quarterly on our cybersecurity performance and risk profile and the effectiveness of our security processes. Compensation Risk Assessment The Compensation Committee, in consultation with Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (&ldquo;Meridian&rdquo;), conducts an annual review of our compensation policies and practices for our employees, to assess the risks associated with such policies and practices. The Compensation Committee considered our mitigation of compensation-related risks, such as our compensation policies and practices that balance short- and long-term goals and awards and provide a mix of the cash and equity components (as described in more detail under &ldquo; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &rdquo; and &ldquo; Executive Compensation &rdquo; below). The Compensation Committee also considered the executive stock ownership guidelines, hedging and pledging prohibitions and oversight process led by the Compensation Committee, the members of which are independent directors. Board Committees Our Board has the following committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, NESG Committee and Executive Committee. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the NESG Committee each operate under a charter that satisfies the applicable standards of the SEC and Nasdaq. The charters for all four committees are available in the &ldquo;Investor Center&mdash;Corporate Governance&mdash;Documents&rdquo; section of our website. Stockholders may also request a copy from Investor Relations, Broadcom Inc., 1320 Ridder Park Drive, San Jose, California 95131. Audit Committee Each member of the Audit Committee is independent in accordance with the audit committee independence requirements under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq. Our Board has determined that Mses.

Upon the recommendation of the NESG Committee, our Board nominated the nine individuals below for election as directors, all of whom are currently directors. Stockholders may not vote their proxies for a greater number of persons than the number of director nominees provided below. Our Board expects that each of the director nominees will be available to serve as a director. In the event a director nominee resigns or otherwise becomes unwilling or unable to serve after the mailing of the Internet Notice but before the Annual Meeting, our intention would be to make a public announcement of such resignation and either reduce the size of our Board or appoint a substitute nominee, in accordance with our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the &ldquo;Bylaws&rdquo;). If we reduce the size of our Board, this would reduce the number of nominees to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Votes received in respect of such director would not be counted in such circumstances. In the event that we instead propose to elect a substitute nominee at the Annual Meeting to fill any such vacancy, it is intended that the shares represented by the proxy will be voted for such substitute nominee. Our Board believes that each director nominee has the experience, qualification, integrity, diversity of background and understanding of our business and industries required for service on our Board. Our Board, in consultation with the NESG Committee, also believes that each director nominee has demonstrated the willingness and the ability to dedicate sufficient time and attention to fulfill the responsibilities required as a director and that the service with other public companies does not and will not impact service on our Board.

Other than as stated above, no fees were billed to Broadcom by PwC for Fiscal Years 2022 and 2021. &nbsp; 22 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS &nbsp; Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Services Policy All engagements with our independent registered public accounting firm, regardless of amount, must be authorized in advance by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated its pre-approval authority to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee, provided that any matters approved in such manner are presented to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Pursuant to the charter of the Audit Committee, committee approval of non-audit services (other than review and attest services) is not required, if such services fall within available exceptions established by the SEC. However, to date, the Audit Committee&rsquo;s policy has been to approve all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm and our management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the Audit Committee&rsquo;s pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date. During Fiscal Years 2022 and 2021, all services provided to Broadcom by PwC were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Our Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of Broadcom for Fiscal Year 2023. Broadcom Inc. 23 &nbsp; Table of Contents AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board with its oversight responsibilities regarding the following: &nbsp; &bull; the quality and integrity of Broadcom&rsquo;s financial statements and internal controls; &nbsp; &bull; the appointment, compensation, retention, qualifications and independence of Broadcom&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm; &nbsp; &bull; the performance of Broadcom&rsquo;s internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm; &nbsp; &bull; Broadcom&rsquo;s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and &nbsp; &bull; related party transactions. Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Statements In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed Broadcom&rsquo;s financial statements for Fiscal Year 2022 with Broadcom&rsquo;s management and PwC. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with PwC, with and without management present, Broadcom&rsquo;s internal controls over financial reporting and the overall quality of Broadcom&rsquo;s financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and the SEC. Based on the Audit Committee&rsquo;s review and discussions noted herein, as well as such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements for Fiscal Year 2022 be included in the 2022 Annual Report for filing with the SEC. Independence and Pre-Approval Policy The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant&rsquo;s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed the independence of PwC with that firm. The Audit Committee&rsquo;s policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by Broadcom&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm. For each proposed service, PwC provides the Audit Committee with a description of the service and sufficient information to confirm PwC&rsquo;s determination that the provision of such service will not impair its independence. The Audit Committee reviewed and pre-approved all audit and non-audit services performed by PwC during Fiscal Year 2022 in accordance with established procedures. Independent Auditor Tenure and Rotation As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm. PwC has been Broadcom&rsquo;s independent auditor since 2006. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having PwC as its independent auditor. These include: &nbsp; &bull; Higher quality audit work and accounting advice due to PwC&rsquo;s institutional knowledge of and familiarity with Broadcom&rsquo;s business and operations, accounting policies and financial systems, and internal control framework. &nbsp; &bull; Operational efficiencies and a resulting lower fee structure because of PwC&rsquo;s history and familiarity with Broadcom&rsquo;s business. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the process for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the lead audit engagement partner every five years. At the Audit Committee&rsquo;s instruction, PwC selects candidates to be considered for this role, who are then interviewed by members of Broadcom&rsquo;s senior management. After discussing the results of senior management&rsquo;s interviews, the Audit Committee interviews the candidates. The Audit Committee then considers the appointment and votes on the selection. The Audit Committee and the Board approved the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Broadcom&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 29, 2023. AUDIT COMMITTEE Justine F. Page, Chairperson Gayla J. Delly Raul J. Fernandez Harry L. You &nbsp; 24 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN Overview Our Board is asking our stockholders to approve an amendment and restatement of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;2012 Plan&rdquo;) to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 25,000,000 shares and extend the time period for which we may grant incentive stock options to February 6, 2033. On February 6, 2023, our Board approved amending and restating the 2012 Plan, subject to stockholder approval. A copy of the 2012 Plan is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix B. The 2012 Plan was originally adopted by the board of directors and shareholders of Broadcom Corporation in 2012. Our Board subsequently amended and restated the 2012 Plan in February 2021 to have terms consistent with good governance and stockholder interests, such as reducing the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance. The 2012 Plan was last approved by our stockholders on April 5, 2021. Our Board approved amending and restating the 2012 Plan so that we could continue to grant equity awards to eligible participants. Competition for top talent is significant in many locations and the semiconductor and technology industries in which we operate. Granting equity awards is a key factor in attracting, motivating and retaining top talent, and is a common benefit offered by our competitors. We view equity awards as a highly-valued benefit that is necessary for Broadcom to effectively compete with other companies and is critical to our continued success. We believe granting equity awards to a vast majority of our employees is one of the main reasons why our global voluntary attrition rate in Fiscal Year 2022 was approximately 6.5%, which is below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2022 Salary Increase and Turnover Study &mdash; Second Edition, September 2022). Broadcom is different than other companies because we grant equity awards to a vast majority of our employees. It is important to Broadcom that our employees align their interests with our stockholders and share in Broadcom&rsquo;s success through equity awards. Broadcom also has a history of acquiring companies and businesses. We are proud that many knowledgeable and talented employees from our acquired companies and businesses have decided to join Broadcom. We believe granting equity awards assists in the successful and rapid integration of our employees who join Broadcom through acquisitions, as well as in retaining them. After our 2021 annual meeting, we have granted equity awards to eligible participants only under the 2012 Plan. As of the Record Date, 19,777,761 shares remained available for issuance under the 2012 Plan. The proposed increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance represents approximately 6.0% of our 416,923,260 shares of common stock outstanding as of January 29, 2023. We expect the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2012 Plan will be reduced further in March 2023 due to grants of regular annual equity awards to a vast majority of our employees, including the recipients of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards. In January 2019, we granted the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards to a vast majority of our employees, including our executive officers. Because the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards vest on the same basis as if four annual equity grants were made on March 15 of each year, beginning in 2019, the recipients of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards have not received regular annual equity awards since 2019. However, the recipients of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards will be eligible to receive equity awards again in March 2023. As such, we believe that it is prudent to replenish the share reserve in the 2012 Plan at this time. The ability to grant equity awards under the 2012 Plan to the recipients of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards is necessary to motivate and retain them and to generate stockholder value. Broadcom Inc. 25 &nbsp; Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; Information Regarding Equity Awards under Broadcom&rsquo;s Equity Plans Outstanding Awards and Share Reserve under the Equity Plans The following table includes information regarding outstanding equity awards (with PSUs included at the maximum performance level) and shares available for future grants under the 2012 Plan, the Avago Technologies Limited 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;Avago Plan&rdquo;) and LSI Corporation 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;LSI Plan&rdquo;) as of January 29, 2023: &nbsp; &nbsp; 2012 Plan &nbsp; &nbsp; LSI Plan (1) &nbsp; &nbsp; Avago Plan (2) &nbsp; Total shares underlying outstanding stock options &nbsp; 1,575 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,863 &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Weighted average exercise price of outstanding stock options $203.16 &nbsp; $47.76 &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options, in years &nbsp; 4.87 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.73 &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; Total shares underlying outstanding unvested restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs &nbsp; 14,130,291 &nbsp; &nbsp; 43,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,479,770 &nbsp; Total shares currently available for grant &nbsp; 19,766,027 &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Following our 2021 annual meeting, we do not grant equity awards under the LSI Plan. (2) The Avago Plan expired in 2019. Dilution, Burn Rate and Overhang under the Equity Plans Our dilution, burn rate and overhang measurements below are calculated with respect to our equity compensation plans. We granted the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards to our employees, including our executive officers, which vest on the same basis as if four annual equity grants were made on March 15 of each year, beginning in 2019. For the burn rate and dilution calculations below, 25% of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards are considered granted in each of Fiscal Year 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Broadcom measures net burn rate as (a) the number of shares subject to equity-based awards (with PSUs included at the maximum performance level) granted under our 2012 Plan, LSI Plan and Avago Plan in a fiscal year (net of cancellations and forfeitures), divided by (b) the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for that fiscal year. Our three-year average annual net burn rate is approximately 1.9%. If we exclude the effects of cancellations and forfeitures, our three-year average annual gross burn rate is approximately 2.5%. Broadcom measures dilution as (a) the total number of shares subject to equity awards outstanding under all of our equity compensation plans (with PSUs included at the maximum performance level) at the end of the fiscal year, divided by (b) the total shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the fiscal year. Our average dilution over the last three fiscal years is approximately 4.3%. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiscal Year &nbsp; &nbsp; Three-Year Average (Fiscal Years 2020-2022) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Options Granted &nbsp; 13,463 &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7,501 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RSUs and PSUs Granted &nbsp; 10,548,827 (1) &nbsp; 9,882,370 (2) &nbsp; 10,361,745 (3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Burn R ate &nbsp; 2.6 % &nbsp; 2.4 % &nbsp; 2.6 % &nbsp; 2.5% &nbsp; Options Cancelled/Forfeited &nbsp; 8,211 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,845 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,651 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RSUs and PSUs Cancelled/Forfeited &nbsp; 2,511,792 (4) &nbsp; 2,846,727 (5) &nbsp; 2,099,329 (6) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net Burn Rate &nbsp; 2.0 % &nbsp; 1.7 % &nbsp; 2.1 % &nbsp; 1.9% &nbsp; Total shares underlying outstanding equity awards &nbsp; 17,555,098 &nbsp; &nbsp; 16,944,297 (7) &nbsp; 18,774,448 (8) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dilution &nbsp; 4.2 % &nbsp; 4.1 % &nbsp; 4.6 % &nbsp; 4.3% &nbsp; Weighted-average common stock outstanding &nbsp; 408,827,512 &nbsp; &nbsp; 409,930,111 &nbsp; &nbsp; 401,836,391 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Common stock outstanding &nbsp; 417,876,276 &nbsp; &nbsp; 412,870,534 &nbsp; &nbsp; 406,502,394 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Includes 7,800,726 shares subject to the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards with a vesting commencement date in Fiscal Year 2022. &nbsp; 26 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; (2) Includes 7,800,726 shares subject to the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards with a vesting commencement date in Fiscal Year 2021 and does not include 7,800,726 shares subject to the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards with a vesting commencement date in Fiscal Year 2022.

(8) Excludes 13,839,236 shares subject to the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards with a vesting commencement date in Fiscal Years 2021 and 2022. An additional metric that we use to measure the cumulative impact of our equity compensation plans is overhang. Broadcom measures overhang as (a) the number of shares subject to equity awards outstanding (with PSUs included at the maximum performance level) plus the number of shares available for grant, divided by (b) the total shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the year. As of January 29, 2023, our overhang was approximately 9.0%, and the three-year average overhang was approximately 17.4%. However, assuming the 2012 Plan had been approved on January 29, 2023, our overhang would have been approximately 15.0% as of such date. &nbsp; &nbsp; As&nbsp;of&nbsp;January&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2023 &nbsp; Adjusted for Increase As of January 29, 2023 &nbsp; Total shares underlying outstanding equity awards &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;17,656,499 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;17,656,499 &nbsp; Total shares available for grant &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;19,766,027 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;44,766,027 &nbsp; Common stock outstanding &nbsp; 416,923,260 &nbsp; 416,923,260 &nbsp; Overhang &nbsp; 9.0% &nbsp; 15.0% &nbsp; Good Governance Provisions in the 2012 Plan The following is a summary of provisions in the 2012 Plan that reflect good governance and are consistent with stockholder interests: &nbsp; &bull; No Evergreen . No &ldquo;evergreen&rdquo; share replenishment provision. &nbsp; &bull; No Repricing Without Stockholder Approval . Prohibits repricing of outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights to a lower exercise price without stockholder approval. &nbsp; &bull; No Dividends Payable on Awards Prior to Vesting. Prohibits payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on an award until it vests, although dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue on unvested awards. &nbsp; &bull; No grants in excess of shares available under the 2012 Plan . Does not allow the granting of awards covering more shares than are then available. &nbsp; &bull; Fair Market Value Grants . The exercise price of a stock option or stock appreciation right may not be less than the fair market value of a share on the date of grant, except when equity awards are assumed or replaced as part of a corporate transaction and the spread between fair market value and exercise price is not increased. &nbsp; &bull; Flexibility to Grant Various Types of Awards; Performance-Based Awards . We may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances, restricted stock, RSUs and other stock-based awards, as well as awards that are subject to performance vesting conditions, such as PSUs. &nbsp; &bull; Specific Limits . We are limited to 4,000,000 shares that may be granted to any participant per calendar year. Broadcom Inc. 27 &nbsp; Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Double-Trigger Change-in-Control Vesting . Provides for accelerated vesting of outstanding awards only if successor entity fails to assume or replace awards following a change in control, unless otherwise provided for in an award agreement. &nbsp; &bull; No Liberal Change-in-Control Definition . Change-in-control events require consummation of the underlying transaction. Summary of the 2012 Plan The following summary of the material provisions of the 2012 Plan is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the 2012 Plan, a copy of which is attached as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement. Share Reserve Subject to stockholder approval of the 2012 Plan, the total number of shares available for new equity award grants (including incentive stock options) will be increased by 25,000,000 shares. With the proposed increase, the total number of shares available for new equity award grants (including incentive stock options) will be 45,000,000 shares, plus the number of shares subject to unvested equity awards granted under the 2012 Plan prior to April 5, 2021 (which was 20,164,288 shares). The proposed increase represents approximately 6.0% of our 416,923,260 shares of common stock outstanding as of January 29, 2023. As of January 29, 2023, 14,131,866 shares were subject to outstanding equity awards under the 2012 Plan (consisting of 1,575 shares subject to options, 10,874,962 shares subject to RSU awards and 3,255,329 shares subject to PSU awards (assuming maximum performance levels)) and 19,766,027 shares remained available for grant under the 2012 Plan. Any Returning Shares will be available for equity award grants under the 2012 Plan to the extent such shares become available. &ldquo;Returning Shares&rdquo; means (i) shares subject to outstanding equity awards under the 2012 Plan that expire or terminate for any reason prior to the issuance of the shares subject to those equity awards, (ii) shares used to pay the exercise price or base price of an equity award and/or shares withheld to satisfy withholding taxes related to the issuance, exercise, vesting or settlement of an equity award, granted under the 2012 Plan, and (iii) unvested shares issued under the 2012 Plan that are cancelled or repurchased by Broadcom pursuant to repurchase rights under the award agreement. Equity awards assumed by Broadcom in connection with a merger, consolidation, stock purchase or similar transaction, or issued by Broadcom in substitution for equity awards granted by another entity in connection with such transaction will not reduce the shares available under the 2012 Plan, nor will shares subject to such assumed or substituted equity awards become available for issuance under the 2012 Plan. No participant in the 2012 Plan may be granted equity awards for more than 4,000,000 shares per calendar year. Eligibility Employees, non-employee directors and consultants in the service of Broadcom or any of its parents or subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 2012 Plan. As of January 29, 2023, all non-employee directors and approximately 20,000 employees and 70 consultants are eligible to participate in and receive equity awards under the 2012 Plan. Valuation Under the 2012 Plan, the fair market value per share on any relevant date is the closing selling price per share in regular hours trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on that date, as reported by Nasdaq. If there is no closing selling price for the shares of Broadcom on the date in question, the fair market value is the closing selling price on the last preceding date for which such price exists. &nbsp; 28 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN&nbsp; &nbsp; Equity Incentive Programs The 2012 Plan consists of two equity incentive programs: (i) the discretionary grant program and (ii) the stock issuance program. The principal features of each program are described below. The term Plan Administrator, as used in this summary, means the Compensation Committee or other committee appointed by our Board, which is authorized to administer the discretionary grant and stock issuance programs. Under the 2012 Plan, the independent directors of our Board may serve as the Plan Administrator for awards granted to our CEO and a disinterested majority of our Board must approve discretionary awards granted to directors who serve on the committee acting as the Plan Administrator . Discretionary Grant Program The Plan Administrator can, subject to the terms of the 2012 Plan, determine who receives an equity award under the discretionary grant program, when equity awards are made, the number of shares subject to each award, the applicable vesting and exercisability schedule, the maximum term for each equity award and whether any option is an incentive stock option or a non-statutory option under the federal tax laws. Stock Options . The Plan Administrator will set the exercise price, which must not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, except pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;), such as assumptions or substitutions of options in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions. No option will have a term in excess of ten years, and each option will generally become exercisable in one or more installments over a specified period of service. However, options may be structured so that they will be immediately exercisable for any or all of the option shares. Any unvested shares acquired under those immediately exercisable options will be subject to repurchase, at the exercise price paid per share, if the participant ceases service with Broadcom prior to vesting in those shares. The exercise price generally may be paid in cash, in shares valued at fair market value on the exercise date or through a sell-to-cover procedure. If a participant ceases service with Broadcom, such participant will have a limited period of time within which to exercise their outstanding options for any shares that are vested and exercisable at the time of such cessation of service. The Plan Administrator has discretion to extend the period during which the outstanding options may be exercised (but not beyond the option term) and/or to permit the option to be exercised with respect to additional shares that would have vested had the participant continued service with Broadcom. Such discretion may be exercised at any time while the options remain outstanding, whether before or after the participant&rsquo;s actual cessation of service. If the participant ceases service with Broadcom for any reason other than misconduct and the entire exercise period falls within a trading blackout period imposed by Broadcom, the Plan Administrator may permit Broadcom to automatically (i) exercise any unexercised portion of the option on the last business day of the exercise period and (ii) withhold the number of shares having a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price and the amount necessary to satisfy any applicable withholding taxes, subject to certain limitations. Stock Appreciation Rights . The Plan Administrator has the authority to issue the following two types of stock appreciation rights under the discretionary grant program: &bull; Tandem stock appreciation rights, which provide participants with the right to surrender their options for a payment in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the vested shares subject to the surrendered option over (ii) the aggregate exercise price payable for those shares. The 2012 Plan clarifies that the base price per share of any tandem stock appreciation rights will be set in accordance with the applicable rules for setting the exercise price of the underlying stock option, and tandem rights may not have a term in excess of ten years. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Standalone stock appreciation rights, which allow participants to exercise those rights as to a specific number of shares and receive in exchange a payment in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares as to which those rights are exercised over (ii) the aggregate base price in effect for those shares. The base price per share may not be less than the fair market value per share on the date the standalone stock appreciation right is granted, and the right may not have a term in excess of ten years. Broadcom Inc. 29 &nbsp; Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; &nbsp; Payments with respect to exercised tandem or standalone stock appreciation rights may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be made in cash or in shares. Upon cessation of service with Broadcom, a participant holding one or more stock appreciation rights will have a limited period within which to exercise those rights as to any shares that are vested and exercisable at the time of such cessation of service. The Plan Administrator has the discretion to extend the period during which the outstanding stock appreciation rights may be exercised (but not beyond the stock appreciation right term) and/or to permit the stock appreciation right to be exercised with respect to additional stock appreciation rights that would have vested had a participant continued service with Broadcom. Such discretion may be exercised at any time while the stock appreciation rights remain outstanding, whether before or after a participant&rsquo;s actual cessation of service. Repricing . The 2012 Plan does not permit options or stock appreciation rights to be repriced to a lower exercise price without first obtaining stockholder approval, except in connection with certain changes to the capital structure, as explained below under &ldquo; General Provisions &mdash; Changes in Capitalization &rdquo; or in issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies or in accordance with the assumption, continuation or replacement of equity awards in connection with a change in control pursuant to the 2012 Plan. Stock Issuance Program Shares may be issued under the stock issuance program for such valid consideration under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate, such as cash or past or future services. In addition, shares of restricted stock may be issued that vest in one or more installments over a participant&rsquo;s period of service or upon attainment of specified performance objectives. Shares may also be issued under such program pursuant to RSUs or other stock-based awards that entitle a participant to receive the shares underlying those awards upon the attainment of designated performance goals, the satisfaction of specified service requirements and/or upon the expiration of a designated deferral period following the vesting of those awards or units, including a deferred distribution date following the cessation of a participant&rsquo;s service with Broadcom. In the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion, awards under the stock issuance program may be structured to vest upon a participant&rsquo;s attainment of retirement eligibility. Alternatively, shares may be fully and immediately vested upon issuance. The Plan Administrator may, subject to the terms of the 2012 Plan, determine who receives an equity award under the stock issuance program, when those equity awards are to be made, the number of shares subject to each equity award, the applicable vesting and issuance schedule for each equity award and the cash consideration (if any) payable per share. The Plan Administrator has the discretionary authority to structure one or more equity awards under the stock issuance program so that the shares will not vest unless performance goals are achieved, including, goals based on total stockholder return. In addition, the performance goals may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of Broadcom&rsquo;s performance relative to the performance of other entities and may also be based on the performance of any of the business groups or divisions thereof or any parent or subsidiary. Performance goals may include a minimum threshold level of performance below which no award will be earned, levels of performance at which specified portions of an award will be earned, and a maximum level of performance at which an award will be fully earned. The Plan Administrator may provide that, if the actual level of attainment for any performance objective is between two specified levels, the amount of the award attributable to that performance objective will be interpolated on a straight-line basis. The Plan Administrator has the discretionary authority at any time to accelerate the vesting and/or waive the vesting requirements of any and all shares of restricted stock or other equity awards outstanding under the stock issuance program. Outstanding RSUs or other stock-based awards under the stock issuance program will automatically terminate, and no shares will actually be issued and the shares subject to such awards will be surrendered (as applicable) if the performance goals or service requirements established for such awards are not attained, except as otherwise provided above or in the applicable award agreement or unless the Plan Administrator waives such requirements. &nbsp; 30 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; General Provisions Change in Control Unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement or another applicable agreement, any equity award that is outstanding immediately before a change in control will not vest, lapse (including, without limitation, with respect to forfeiture restrictions or rights of repurchase), and/or become exercisable (as applicable) solely as a result of the change in control, but will instead be assumed, continued, or replaced with a cash retention program that preserves the spread existing at the time of the change in control. The equity awards, so assumed, continued or replaced, will vest, become exercisable, or have any restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of such equity awards in effect immediately before the change in control, subject to the following conditions. The 2012 Plan specifies that performance-based equity awards (including, without limitation, PSUs) will not be deemed to have been assumed, continued or replaced unless those with performance periods that remain in progress as of the date of the change in control are deemed to have been achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels for the entire performance period (and not pro rata); provided that the performance-based equity awards will continue to be subject to any time-based vesting conditions that were applicable to them before assumption, continuation or replacement. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement or another applicable agreement, if the Plan Administrator determines the outstanding equity awards are not assumed, continued or replaced in accordance with the 2012 Plan, effective immediately before the change in control but conditioned upon its completion, with corresponding payments made no later than within thirty (30) days following the change in control: &bull; All outstanding equity awards under the discretionary grant program will become fully vested and exercisable (as applicable), and if a participant does not exercise all such awards, the Plan Administrator will pay such participant in exchange for the cancellation of each such unexercised award the difference between the per share consideration provided to other similarly situated stockholders in the change in control and the exercise price or base price per share (as applicable), with such payment generally to be made in cash and/or shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion (less applicable withholding taxes); provided that any such awards for which the exercise or base price (as applicable) exceeds the per share consideration will be cancelled and terminated without payment; &bull; All restrictions imposed on equity awards made under the stock issuance program that are not performance-based will lapse and be of no further force and effect, such that all such equity awards will become fully vested, settled (if applicable) and paid generally in cash and/or shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion; and &bull; All performance-based equity awards for which the performance period has been completed as of the date of the change in control but which have not yet been paid will vest and be paid in cash and/or shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion, with all performance goals to be deemed achieved at actual performance. Further, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement or another applicable agreement, all performance-based equity awards for which the performance period has not been completed as of the date of the change in control will, with respect to each applicable performance goal and other vesting criteria, be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, and vest and be paid out for the entire performance period (and not pro rata), with the manner of payment to be made generally in cash or shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion. Stockholder Rights and Option Transferability The holder of an option or stock appreciation right will have no stockholder rights with respect to the shares subject to that option or stock appreciation right unless and until such participant exercises the option or stock appreciation right and becomes a holder of record of the shares distributed upon exercise of such award. Incentive stock options are not assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of inheritance following the participant&rsquo;s death, and during the participant&rsquo;s lifetime, may only be exercised by the participant. However, the Plan Administrator may structure non-statutory options and standalone stock appreciation rights so they may be transferred or assigned during the participant&rsquo;s lifetime, by gift or pursuant to a domestic relations order, to one or more members of the participant&rsquo;s family or to a trust established for the benefit of the participant and/or one or more such family members or to the participant&rsquo;s former spouse. A participant will have the right to vote shares issued to the participant under the stock issuance program, regardless of whether the participant&rsquo;s interest in those shares is vested. However, a participant will not have the right to vote the shares subject to a RSU or share right award until such award vests and the underlying shares are Broadcom Inc. 31 &nbsp; Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; issued. Dividend-equivalent units may be credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom shares, on outstanding unvested shares issued under the stock issuance program or RSU or share right awards, subject to such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate, provided that any applicable dividend and dividend equivalent amounts with respect to unvested shares or any share underlying any equity award may be accrued but not paid to a participant until all conditions or restrictions relating to such share have been satisfied or lapsed and will be forfeited if all of such conditions or restrictions are never satisfied or lapse. Changes in Capitalization If any change is made to shares by reason of any recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction or other change affecting the outstanding shares as a class without our receipt of consideration or should the value of outstanding shares be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, appropriate adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the 2012 Plan, (ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted equity awards under the 2012 Plan per calendar year, (iii) the class of securities and the exercise price or base price per share (or any other cash consideration payable per share) in effect under each outstanding option or stock appreciation right, and (iv) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding RSU or other stock-based award under the 2012 Plan and the cash consideration (if any) payable per share. The adjustments will be made in such manner as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate to prevent the dilution or enlargement of rights and benefits under the 2012 Plan and the outstanding equity awards thereunder, and such adjustments will be final, binding and conclusive. Amendment and Termination Our Board may amend or modify the 2012 Plan at any time, subject to any required stockholder approval. Stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that (i) materially increases the number of shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan, (ii) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive equity awards under the 2012 Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to participants under the 2012 Plan or materially reduces the price at which shares may be issued or purchased under the 2012 Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the 2012 Plan, (v) expands the types of awards available for issuance under the 2012 Plan, or (vi) is otherwise required by applicable law or the requirements of the stock exchange on which the shares are at the time primarily traded. In addition, our Board may not amend the 2012 Plan to remove the requirement for stockholder approval of any form of repricing of stock options or stock appreciation rights. Unless sooner terminated by our Board, the 2012 Plan will terminate on the earliest to occur (i) all shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan have been issued as fully-vested shares or (ii) the termination of all outstanding equity awards in connection with a change in control. All equity awards outstanding at the time the 2012 Plan terminates will continue in force and effect in accordance with the provisions of the documents evidencing those awards. However, if our stockholders approve the 2012 Plan, no stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, may be granted after February 6, 2033. If our stockholders do not approve the 2012 Plan, no such stock options may be granted after February 5, 2031. New Plan Benefits Future grants under the 2012 Plan will be made at the discretion of the Plan Administrator and, accordingly, are not yet determinable. After the end of Fiscal Year 2022, Broadcom granted Mr. Tan and Dr. Kawwas PSU awards, however, the amount of shares are not determinable as the vesting is contingent on both achievement of formidable stock performance milestones and continued service requirements over a five-year period. Additional information about these PSU Awards are in &ldquo; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &mdash; Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation Actions .&rdquo; Broadcom also expects to grant each of our non-employee directors re-elected at the Annual Meeting annual RSU awards that have a target value of $250,000 on the date of the Annual Meeting. For additional information about these RSU awards, see &ldquo; Board of Directors &mdash; Director Compensation &mdash; Equity Compensation .&rdquo; Additional Information Regarding Equity Awards Granted under the 2012 Plan A summary of equity awards granted to our NEOs under equity compensation plans, including the 2012 Plan, that were outstanding as of October 30, 2022 is in the &ldquo; Executive Compensation &mdash; Fiscal Year 2022 Outstanding Equity &nbsp; 32 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table .&rdquo; We granted equity awards under the 2012 Plan to our non-employee directors covering an aggregate of 50,857 shares from February 1, 2016 through January 29, 2023. Since February 1, 2016, we granted equity awards under the 2012 Plan covering an aggregate of 47,310,643 shares to employees who are not executive officers and to consultants. This number reflects PSU awards that have vested at actual performance levels and unvested PSU awards assuming target performance levels. Since February 1, 2016, we have granted 13,463 stock options under the 2012 Plan. Further information about historical grants made to our NEOs and non-employee directors can be found in proxy statements filed with the SEC by Broadcom and our predecessors (Broadcom Limited and Avago Technologies Limited). Federal Income Tax Consequences The following discussion summarizes material income tax consequences of the 2012 Plan under current federal income tax law and is intended for general information only. Other federal taxes and foreign, state and local income taxes are not discussed, and may vary depending upon individual circumstances and locality. Moreover, existing law is subject to change by new legislation, new regulations, administrative pronouncements, and court decisions or by new or clarified interpretations or applications of existing laws, regulations, administrative pronouncements and court decisions. Any such change may affect the federal income tax consequences described below. Interested parties should consult their own tax advisors as to specific tax consequences. Option Grants Options granted under the 2012 Plan may be either incentive stock options, which satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code, or non-statutory stock options, which are not intended to meet such requirements. The federal income tax treatment for the two types of options is as follows: &bull; Incentive Stock Options . No taxable income is recognized when an incentive stock option is granted or exercised (except for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, in which case taxation is the same as for non-statutory stock options). If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares more than two years after the grant date and more than one year after the exercise date, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain or loss. If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares before the end of the two- or one-year holding periods described above, the participant generally will have ordinary income at the time of the sale equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or the sale price, if less) minus the exercise price of the option. Any excess of the sales price over the fair market value at the date of exercise will be recognized by the participant as capital gain (long-term or short-term depending on the length of time the shares were held after the stock option was exercised). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Non-Statutory Stock Options . No taxable income is recognized when a non-statutory stock option is granted to a participant. Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (on the exercise date) of the shares purchased over the exercise price of the option. Any taxable income recognized in connection with an option exercise by an employee participant is subject to tax withholding by Broadcom. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the shares acquired upon exercise of the non-statutory option are unvested and subject to repurchase in the event of the participant&rsquo;s cessation of service prior to vesting in those shares, the participant will not recognize any taxable income at the time of exercise but will have to report as ordinary income, as and when the repurchase right lapses, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares on the date the repurchase right lapses over (ii) the exercise price paid for the shares. The participant may elect under Section 83(b) of the Code to include as ordinary income in the year of exercise of the option an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the purchased shares on the exercise date over (ii)&nbsp;the exercise price paid for such shares. If such timely Section 83(b) election is made, the participant will not recognize any additional income as and when the repurchase right lapses. Broadcom Inc. 33 &nbsp; Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; Stock Appreciation Rights No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a stock appreciation right. The participant will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the stock appreciation right is exercised, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the exercise date over the base price in effect for the exercised right, and Broadcom will be required to collect certain withholding taxes applicable to such income from the participant. If the stock appreciation right is exercised for stock, any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss. Restricted Stock Unless a participant who receives an award of restricted stock makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code as described below, the participant generally is not required to recognize ordinary income upon the grant of restricted stock. Instead, on the date the restrictions lapse and the shares vest (that is, become transferable and no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture), the participant will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on that date over the amount, if any, paid for those shares. If a participant makes a Section 83(b) election to recognize ordinary income on the date the restricted shares are granted, the amount of ordinary income required to be recognized is equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant over the amount, if any, paid for those shares. In that case, the participant will not be required to recognize additional ordinary income when the restrictions lapse and the shares vest. Direct Stock Issuances The participant will recognize ordinary income in the year in which shares are actually issued to the participant. The amount of that income will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance less the amount, if any, paid for those shares, and Broadcom will be required to collect certain withholding taxes applicable to such income from the participant. RSUs and Other Stock-Based Awards A participant generally is not required to recognize income upon the grant of a RSU or other stock-based award, including PSU awards. When such awards vest, the participant will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares that vest. Broadcom will be required to collect certain withholding taxes applicable to such ordinary income from the participant. Upon the sale of any shares that are delivered to the participant pursuant to an award, the participant will realize either long-term or short-term capital gain (or loss), depending on how long the shares were held, equal to the difference between the amount realized and the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares were vested or delivered to the participant pursuant to the award. General Tax Effect for Broadcom Broadcom is generally entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an equity award under the 2012 Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, upon the exercise of a non-statutory stock option). Moreover, if a participant recognizes ordinary income due to a disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option, Broadcom will generally be entitled to a deduction in the same amount. Impact of Section 409A of the Code The 2012 Plan, as well as payments and benefits under the 2012 Plan, are intended to be exempt from, or to the extent subject thereto, to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the 2012 Plan will be interpreted in accordance therewith. We make no representations that any or all payments or benefits described the 2012 Plan will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and make no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any such payment. The optionee or the participate will be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A of the Code. &nbsp; 34 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN &nbsp; Required Vote We believe strongly that the approval of the 2012 Plan is important to Broadcom&rsquo;s continued success. Such approval will enable Broadcom to attract, motivate and retain individuals who are critical to the success of Broadcom. The affirmative vote of a majority of votes represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to approve the 2012 Plan. For the effects of abstentions and broker non-votes on this Proposal 3, see &ldquo; Additional Meeting Information&mdash;Board Recommendations, Required Vote and Effects of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes. &rdquo; Our Board recommends a vote FOR approval of an Amendment and Restatement of the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. Broadcom Inc. 35 &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; PROPOSAL 4: SAY ON PAY &nbsp; PROPOSAL 4: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION In accordance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as described in the &ldquo; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &rdquo; and the compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosure under &ldquo; Executive Compensation &rdquo; in this Proxy Statement. We currently hold the say-on-pay vote annually and expect the next say-on-pay vote will occur at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. Our executive compensation program is based on challenging and rigorous short-term financial and operational targets and long-term business objectives and strategies, and is designed to reward our executive officers for producing sustainable growth and to align their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders, as well as attract and retain top talent. When setting financial and operational targets for the short-term incentives and performance goals for the long-term incentives, the Compensation Committee judiciously determines, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, the target levels and peer index that would significantly enhance stockholder value, be difficult to attain and require substantial effort to achieve by our executive officers. For Fiscal Year 2022, we increased revenue by 21% and operating income by 67%. We believe the compensation paid to our NEOs for Fiscal Year 2022 appropriately reflects and rewards our executive officers&rsquo; contributions to Broadcom&rsquo;s strong performance despite the continued disruption in normal business activities, including the ongoing supply chain constraints, and is aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Consistent with our previous commitment, we did not grant regular annual equity incentive awards to Ms. Spears, Messrs. Brazeal and Krause, and Dr. Kawwas in Fiscal Year 2022 because they were granted 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards. Stockholders are being asked to approve the following resolution: &ldquo;RESOLVED THAT stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Broadcom&rsquo;s named executive officers, as disclosed in &ldquo; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &rdquo; and in the compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosure under &ldquo; Executive Compensation &rdquo; in this Proxy Statement.&rdquo; In deciding how to vote on this proposal, stockholders are encouraged to read the &ldquo; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &rdquo; and &ldquo; Executive Compensation &rdquo; sections of this Proxy Statement. While the vote on this resolution is advisory and not binding, the Compensation Committee and our Board values input from stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote on this resolution when considering future executive compensation decisions. Our Board recommends a vote FOR approval of the named executive officer compensation on an advisory basis. &nbsp; 36 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents PROPOSAL 5: SAY ON PAY &nbsp; PROPOSAL 5: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF THE ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION In accordance with the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, we are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the frequency with which stockholders would have an opportunity to provide an advisory vote to approve the compensation of named executive officers. Stockholders have the option of selecting a frequency of one, two or three years, or abstaining. Our Board believes that holding an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every year continues to be appropriate for Broadcom. This will enable our stockholders to vote, on an advisory basis, to approve the most recent compensation information that is presented in our proxy statement, leading to a more meaningful and coherent communication between us and our stockholders on the compensation of our named executive officers. While the vote on this resolution is advisory and not binding, the Compensation Committee and our Board values input from stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote on this resolution when determining how often stockholders will be asked to vote, on an advisory basis, on named executive officer compensation. Our Board recommends a vote for 1 YEAR with respect to the frequency of the advisory vote on named executive officer compensation. Broadcom Inc. 37 &nbsp; Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; &nbsp; COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following Compensation Discussion&nbsp;and Analysis (the &ldquo;CD&amp;A&rdquo;) describes the philosophy, objectives and structure of our Fiscal Year 2022 executive compensation program. This CD&amp;A is intended to be read in conjunction with the tables and other information beginning on page&nbsp; 58 . Our NEOs for Fiscal Year 2022 were: &nbsp; &bull; Hock E. Tan, President and Chief Executive Officer &nbsp; &bull; Kirsten M. Spears, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer &nbsp; &bull; Mark D. Brazeal, Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer &nbsp; &bull; Charlie B. Kawwas, Ph.D., President, Semiconductor Solutions Group &nbsp; &bull; Thomas H. Krause, Jr., Former President, Broadcom Software Group Executive Summary Our executive compensation program is based upon challenging and rigorous short-term financial and operational performance targets combined with long-term business objectives and strategies to create sustained stockholder value. We provide above-market pay opportunities for excellent performance and appropriately adjust for underperformance, if that occurs. We seek to closely align our executive officers&rsquo; interests with those of our stockholders by allocating a significant portion of our executives&rsquo; compensation opportunity to variable compensation tied to our financial and strategic performance, our stock price value or both. Fiscal Year 2022 Performance Financial Results Highlights Our performance in Fiscal Year 2022 continued to be strong despite the on-going impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties. Highlights of our financial results include: &nbsp; &bull; Increased year-over-year revenue to $33,203 million, 21% above Fiscal Year 2021. &nbsp; &bull; Increased GAAP operating income to $14,225 million, 67% above Fiscal Year 2021; and increased non-GAAP operating income* to $20,294 million, 28% above Fiscal Year 2021. &nbsp; &bull; Increased net cash provided by operating activities to $16,736 million, 22% above Fiscal Year 2021; and increased free cash flow* to $16,312 million, 22% above Fiscal Year 2021. Revenue (in billions) Operating Income (in billions) Free Cash Flow (in billions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *See Appendix A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. &nbsp; 38 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Return of Capital to Stockholders Our strong cash flow in Fiscal Year 2021 enabled us to return an aggregate of $14,032 million to our stockholders during Fiscal Year 2022, consisting of $7,032 million in cash dividends and $7,000 million under our stock repurchase program. We also paid $1,455 million for the elimination of shares withheld to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. In addition, our strong free cash flow in Fiscal Year 2022 enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $4.60 per share in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, an increase of 12% over the quarterly dividend paid in Fiscal Year 2022. Dividends Total Stockholder Return Our five-year TSR performance, based on an investment of $100 in Broadcom common stock on the last trading day of our fiscal year 2017 and assuming reinvestment of dividends, has been substantial on both an absolute and relative basis, returning $222 on a $100 investment. Although our one-year TSR decreased as a result of broader market volatility during Fiscal Year 2022, we still outperformed our peer group median and the S&amp;P 500 as shown below. Cumulative TSR Our one-, three- and five-year TSR outperformed our peer group median and the S&amp;P 500 Index. Our TSR increased by 21.1% annually on average over the past three fiscal years and by 17.3% annually on average over the past five fiscal years. We significantly increased our absolute TSR since our initial public offering in 2009 by over 3,700% , with an annual average increase of 31.8% . Say-on-Pay At the 2022 annual meeting, our stockholders showed support of our executive compensation program, with approximately 80% of the votes cast in favor of the non-binding, advisory say-on-pay proposal. Broadcom Inc. 39 &nbsp; Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2022 Compensation Highlights Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Payouts for Fiscal Year 2022 Company Performance Payouts under the APB Plan were tied to challenging and rigorous pre-established annual corporate and divisional performance goals, as well as the individual contributions and performance of each executive. The APB Plan payouts reflected the following considerations: &nbsp; &bull; The Compensation Committee set two challenging and rigorous Fiscal Year 2022 corporate performance goals &ndash; revenue and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of revenue (&ldquo;adjusted non-GAAP operating margin&rdquo;) &ndash; at target attainment levels that would enhance stockholder value and require substantial effort to achieve. &nbsp; &bull; Our NEOs achieved the maximum attainment level for the corporate performance goals despite headwinds from macroeconomic volatility, resulting in 150% attainment of the corporate performance goals under the APB Plan. &nbsp; &bull; The divisional performance goals unrelated to revenue and operating margin exceeded target performance levels. &nbsp; &bull; Our NEOs also exerted significant efforts in our pending acquisition of VMware, Inc. (&ldquo;VMware&rdquo;). &bull; Based on careful assessment by the Compensation Committee (and the independent directors in the case of our CEO), our NEOs received individual performance multipliers between 120% and 150%. There were no increases to our NEOs&rsquo; target bonus opportunities in Fiscal Year 2022. Ms. Spears, Dr. Kawwas and Messrs. Brazeal and Krause were not granted regular annual equity incentive awards in Fiscal Year 2022 due to their previously granted 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards that covered regular annual equity incentive awards through Fiscal Year 2022. CEO Equity Incentive Awards The independent directors, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, granted an annual PSU award to Mr. Tan to incentivize and encourage Mr. Tan&rsquo;s retention in a highly competitive talent market and to recognize his invaluable leadership in increasing stockholder value and furthering our corporate strategy. Mr. Tan was also granted a separate, smaller in size strategic PSU award to reward achievement of specific strategic priorities in Fiscal Year 2022 that went beyond the standard day-to-day operations responsibilities and were critical in a year when there were expectations of a possible realignment in the global markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainties. See the &ldquo; Elements of Executive Compensation &ndash; Long-Term Incentive Compensation &rdquo; section below for more information relating to these awards. Promotion Equity Incentive Awards In December 2021, Mr. Brazeal was promoted and assumed responsibilities as our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer in addition to his continuing Chief Legal Officer responsibilities. The Compensation Committee granted Mr. Brazeal equity incentive awards solely in connection with his promotion and increased responsibilities. See the &ldquo; Elements of Executive Compensation &ndash; Long-Term Incentive Compensation &rdquo; section below for more information relating to these awards. Overview of Our Executive Compensation Program The Compensation Committee believes that, in general, a significant portion of our executive officers&rsquo; target total direct compensation should be comprised of performance-based incentives. Accordingly, our executive compensation program is designed to reward our executive officers for producing sustainable growth in stockholder value consistent with our strategic plan, align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, and attract and retain top talent in a highly competitive talent market. &nbsp; 40 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Target Total Direct Compensation Our annual total direct compensation consists of three principal elements: &nbsp; Base&nbsp;Salary Individual salaries reflect the executive&rsquo;s responsibilities and sustained individual performance. Salaries are set to be competitive with market and industry norms. Short-Term Incentives&nbsp;(STI) The APB Plan is intended to reward the achievement of pre-established annual corporate and divisional performance goals, as well as the individual contributions and performance of each executive. In Fiscal Year 2022, our corporate performance goals were (i) revenue and (ii) adjusted non-GAAP operating income. Pre-established attainment levels are designed to significantly enhance stockholder value, to be difficult to attain, to require substantial effort to achieve and to avoid excessive compensation-related risks. Long-Term Incentives (LTI) RSU and PSU awards are granted to encourage and reward the efforts of our executives to grow sustainable, long-term stockholder value. These equity awards further encourage retention and mitigate compensation-related risks with related ownership guidelines. The following charts compare the Fiscal Year 2022 target total direct compensation for our CEO and our other NEOs, except for Mr. Krause who resigned in July 2022. Mr. Krause did not receive any severance or bonus payments and forfeited all outstanding, unvested equity awards in connection with his resignation. Target total direct compensation consists of (i) base salary, (ii) target STI through the APB Plan, and (iii) target LTI in the form of equity awards comprised of RSU and PSU awards based on the fair market value of the awards on the grant date, assuming target performance, as applicable. The Average Other NEO chart also includes the portion of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards that began vesting in March 2022 based on the fair market value on the January 2019 grant date and assuming target performance. The 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards vest on the same basis as if four annual equity grants were made on March 15 each year, beginning in 2019 for four successive years. As shown in the charts below, over 95% of our CEO&rsquo;s and 90% of our other NEOs&rsquo; average target total direct compensation in Fiscal Year 2022 is comprised of variable, performance-based compensation.

Equity awards are a long-term retention tool for our key executives. When granting equity awards or when recommending to the independent directors an equity award grant to our CEO, the Compensation Committee considers each executive&rsquo;s role, responsibilities, experience and expertise and overall value to Broadcom, as well as how much unvested equity the executive then holds as an indicator of retention risk. The Compensation Committee has adopted a compensation philosophy that is designed to keep our executives&rsquo; target total direct compensation competitive with the compensation of executives in comparable positions at other companies in our compensation peer group and third-party market pay surveys. Generally, target total cash compensation falls below the median of the competitive market, but in combination with equity, target total direct compensation may be higher. The Compensation Committee bases its decisions on the needs of Broadcom and an executive&rsquo;s level of sustained performance, expertise, experience, marketability and internal equitability. While the Compensation Committee and our Board generally consider the accounting and tax implications of their executive compensation decisions, neither element has been a material consideration in the compensation awarded to our NEOs historically. &nbsp; 42 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Say-on-Pay The Compensation Committee values the input received from our stockholders. Each year we engage with our stockholders and obtain feedback on our executive compensation program. At the 2022 annual meeting, our stockholders showed support of our executive compensation program, with approximately 80% of the votes cast in favor of the non-binding, advisory say-on-pay proposal. In Fiscal Year 2022, we contacted stockholders beneficially owning over 50% of our then outstanding shares of common stock and engaged with stockholders owning approximately 49% of our then outstanding stock. Our Lead Independent Director and our chairperson of the Compensation Committee, along with members of management, participated in these engagements and discussed corporate governance, ESG initiatives, executive compensation, including long-term incentive compensation, and succession planning. These stockholders indicated that they continue to be generally supportive of our executive compensation actions and decisions and overall program design. The feedback received from our stockholders was reported by our Lead Independent Director and our chairperson of the Compensation Committee to both the full Compensation Committee and Board Compensation Determination Process Role of the Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee devotes extensive time throughout the year to our executive compensation program to ensure that it aligns executive pay with corporate performance and rewards our executives for pursuing corporate financial, operational and strategic goals that will create sustainable, long-term stockholder value. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation of our key executives, except our CEO, for whom the Compensation Committee makes recommendations for review and approval by the independent directors. Individual Executive Compensation Assessment . In addition to market compensation data provided by its compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee (and, in the case of our CEO, the independent directors) considers the following information, among other factors, for each executive when determining his or her compensation: &bull; current base salary, target APB Plan opportunities (and prior fiscal year payouts), the accumulated value of outstanding and unvested equity awards and other benefits; &bull; the individual&rsquo;s overall performance, role, responsibilities, knowledge, skills, leadership and contributions to Broadcom&rsquo;s values and culture; and &bull; our CEO&rsquo;s recommendation on compensation and individual performance (other than for himself). This information helps the Compensation Committee and the independent directors to understand the long-term retentive elements and total compensation delivered to our executives. Internal Pay Parity. While we do not maintain a formal policy regarding internal pay parity, it is considered by the Compensation Committee and the independent directors when determining compensation. Consistent with market practice, our CEO is compensated at a higher level than our other executives due to his higher level of responsibility, accountability and experience. Given Mr. Tan&rsquo;s responsibility for our overall performance, the independent directors believe that compensating him at a higher level than our other executives and weighting his total compensation more heavily toward long-term, performance-based incentive compensation is consistent with market practice, appropriately reflects his contributions and directly aligns his incentives with the interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, Mr. Tan receives more of his target total direct compensation in the form of LTI compensation through PSU awards as compared to our other executives. Broadcom Inc. 43 &nbsp; Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; &nbsp; Compensation Risk Oversight. While our Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the Compensation Committee annually reviews and discusses the risks that relate to all of our compensation policies and practices, including incentive and commission arrangements below the executive level. Role of Compensation Consultant In December 2021, the Compensation Committee retained Meridian as its independent compensation consultant to assume the role previously held by Compensia, Inc. (&ldquo;Compensia&rdquo;). Meridian provided consulting services to the Compensation Committee and the independent directors, including assessments of executive and non-employee director compensation based on analyses of competitive market compensation data. In addition, the Compensation Committee relied on Meridian for periodic updates on regulatory developments and market trends related to executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Meridian did not provide any other services to Broadcom except advising the Compensation Committee and the independent directors on executive and non-employee director compensation-related matters. The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Meridian pursuant to the SEC and Nasdaq rules and concluded that Meridian was independent and its work for the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflict of interest. Compensation Competitive Analysis The Compensation Committee works with its independent compensation consultant to develop a meaningful compensation peer group for purposes of understanding competitive market compensation practices. This peer group is annually reviewed and updated as necessary. The peer group is used for comparative purposes only. The Compensation Committee does not benchmark any pay elements or target total direct compensation to a specific percentile. In the absence of relevant peer group data, the Compensation Committee reviews industry-based market pay survey data (&ldquo;market survey data&rdquo;). In August 2021, the Compensation Committee approved the compensation peer group for Fiscal Year 2022, which appears below and was developed in consultation with Compensia. Booking Holdings was removed from the compensation peer group for Fiscal Year 2022 due to its revenues and market capitalization falling outside of the selection criteria set forth below. Advanced Micro Devices was added to the compensation peer group for Fiscal Year 2022 based on the applicable relevant selection criteria set forth below. The following selection criteria were considered as guidelines when developing the compensation peer group: &bull; Revenue : comparability across annual revenue, generally 0.5 to 2.0 times that of Broadcom &bull; Market capitalization : market capitalization that generally fall between 0.3 to 3.0 times that of Broadcom &bull; Industry : companies in semiconductor-related and other technology-focused industries having a similar scale &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2022 Peer Group 3M Company &nbsp; Cisco Systems, Inc. &nbsp; International Business Machines Corporation &nbsp; PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(2) Represents publicly reported revenue for the trailing four quarters ended May 2, 2021. Elements of Executive Compensation The principal elements of our executive compensation program are: &bull; base salary; &bull; an annual cash incentive bonus plan; &bull; LTI compensation in the form of equity awards; &bull; severance and change in control payments and benefits; and &bull; modest perquisites and other personal benefits. &nbsp; Base Salary We believe that a competitive base salary is an important element of our executive compensation program designed to attract, engage and retain our executive officers. Base salaries provide fixed, baseline compensation and are set at levels intended to reflect an executive&rsquo;s sustained individual performance and level and scope of responsibility, to be within a competitive range for similar positions at the companies in our compensation peer group and/or market survey data, and to take into account internal pay parity among our executive officers. The Compensation Committee also reviews our economic and business conditions and outlook. The base salaries of our key executives are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. Our CEO makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to base salary adjustments for our executive officers (other than himself). The Compensation Committee also reviews and considers many factors in determining individual performance for the purposes of adjusting base salaries. These factors include division performance against budget, achievement of divisional goals, new product introductions and corporate strategy implementation. Consistent with this process and based on a market review of the NEOs&rsquo; roles and responsibilities in a highly competitive talent market, the Compensation Committee approved in May 2022 modest increases to the base salaries of the NEOs (other than the CEO), effective July 2022 and as set forth below.

Under the APB Plan, we provide a performance-based annual cash incentive bonus opportunity for our executive officers. The APB Plan is designed to encourage and motivate our executive officers to achieve our overall corporate goals for the fiscal year, as well as divisional goals where appropriate, and to drive positive contributions to Broadcom&rsquo;s growth and performance. Each executive officer is annually assigned a specified target annual cash incentive bonus opportunity under the APB Plan, expressed as a percentage of the executive officer&rsquo;s eligible earnings. The Compensation Committee considers compensation peer group and market data in determining the executive officer&rsquo;s target annual cash incentive opportunity. In the case of our CEO, the Compensation Committee provides the data in its recommendation to the independent directors. The Compensation Committee and the independent directors also consider other factors that influence corporate and operational results, such as the executive&rsquo;s experience, performance, leadership, responsibility and internal equitability. Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan The target annual cash incentive opportunity for our NEOs did not change in Fiscal Year 2022. The following is the APB Plan target bonus percentage for our NEOs. NEO Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan Target Bonus (as&nbsp;a&nbsp;%&nbsp;of&nbsp;eligible&nbsp;earnings) Hock E. Tan 200% Kirsten M. Spears 100% Mark D. Brazeal 100% Charlie B. Kawwas, Ph.D. 100% Thomas H. Krause, Jr. 100% Annual cash incentive bonuses under the APB Plan are calculated as follows: &nbsp; Bonuses under the APB Plan are payable to our NEOs in cash, except for our CEO in certain circumstances. In the event the independent directors assign our CEO an individual performance multiplier (discussed in more detail below) greater than 100%, they may elect to pay the difference between the dollar amount of our CEO&rsquo;s actual annual cash incentive bonus payout and the dollar amount of his annual cash incentive bonus payout calculated using a performance factor of 100% in the form of an equity award. The type and terms of any such equity award are determined by the independent directors. The independent directors believe that this feature gives them the flexibility to further incentivize our CEO to focus on our mid-term to long-term performance and value creation for our stockholders and to provide continued retention of our CEO. &nbsp; 46 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Corporate Performance Components The corporate performance goals for the Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan are set forth below. &nbsp; Attainment Level &nbsp; &nbsp; Threshold Target Maximum Revenue (in millions) $ 28,673 &nbsp; $ 30,183 &nbsp; $ 31,692 &nbsp; Adjusted non-GAAP operating income (as a % of revenue) &nbsp; 59.7 % &nbsp; 60.7 % &nbsp; 62.7 % &nbsp; These performance levels were established in December 2021 by the Compensation Committee, taking into account the recommendation of our CEO, and approved by the independent directors. The target levels were designed to require substantial effort to achieve, while driving a significant increase in stockholder value. Each goal carried an equal weighting of 50% of the corporate performance component. Divisional Performance Components The Compensation Committee, taking into account our CEO&rsquo;s recommendations, determined in December 2021 the executive officer&rsquo;s divisional goals and set their weightings based on its assessment of the business requirements of the particular division to which the goals related and the relative importance of the goals to the division. Each divisional goal was set by the Compensation Committee to be difficult to attain and to require substantial effort by the division and the NEO in charge of the division to achieve. The table below under &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan Attainment and Payout Amounts &rdquo; sets forth the divisional goals for Fiscal Year 2022. Individual Performance Multiplier The final payouts under the APB Plan include the effect of a non-subjective individual performance multiplier applied judiciously to recognize the extraordinary efforts of our executives despite adverse market conditions or exceptional performance with respect to our corporate goals or an executive&rsquo;s division results. Each individual NEO&rsquo;s performance multiplier (other than our CEO&rsquo;s) is approved by the Compensation Committee based, in part, on the recommendations of our CEO and by the independent directors, in the case of our CEO, with input from the Compensation Committee. In evaluating individual performance to determine the applicable multiplier, the Compensation Committee considers (i) the requirements of the NEO&rsquo;s position and role, including the achievement of the corporate or divisional goals, (ii) fiscal responsibility as determined by the Compensation Committee with input from our CEO, (iii) demonstration of senior leadership, (iv) contribution to Broadcom&rsquo;s values and culture, and (v) how each of these factors impact the overall performance of Broadcom or the NEO&rsquo;s division, as applicable. Based on this evaluation, the Compensation Committee or, in the case of our CEO, the independent directors, assigns each NEO an individual performance multiplier of between 50% and 150%. NEOs who consistently meet or exceed the requirements of their position, as determined by the Compensation Committee, receive an individual performance multiplier between 100% and 150%. NEOs who meet some, but not all, of the requirements of their position or for whom the Compensation Committee believes that improvement is needed receive an individual performance multiplier between 50% and 100%. Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan Attainment In December 2022, the Compensation Committee and the independent directors reviewed Broadcom&rsquo;s actual performance for Fiscal Year 2022 to determine the level of achievement for the corporate performance goals and the divisional goals, and to assign an individual performance multiplier for each of our executives. Corporate Performance Component For Fiscal Year 2022, we achieved revenue of $33,203 million and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 63.8%, both of which were above the pre-established maximum attainment levels of performance. See Appendix A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

For Fiscal Year 2022, the divisional goals for Ms. Spears and Mr. Brazeal were based on fiscal responsibility of their divisions and ability to control the direct expenses of their division. In December 2022, the Compensation Committee determined that the divisional goals of Ms. Spears and Mr. Brazeal were achieved as set forth below in &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan Attainment and Payout Amounts. &rdquo; Due to their promotions in December 2020, Dr. Kawwas and Mr. Krause were not subject to divisional goals in Fiscal Year 2022. Individual Performance Multiplier The Compensation Committee, with input from our CEO, determined the individual performance multipliers for each of our NEOs (other than our CEO and, due to his resignation, Mr. Krause) for Fiscal Year 2022. Ms. Spears, Mr. Brazeal and Dr. Kawwas received an individual performance multiplier between 120% to 150% due to their strong leadership and extraordinary efforts in increasing our revenue by 21% and achieving our 63.8% non-GAAP operating margin in Fiscal Year 2022 despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, challenging macroeconomic environment and continued supply chain disruptions. Ms. Spears, Mr. Brazeal and Dr. Kawwas also exerted significant efforts, along with Mr. Tan, on the pending acquisition of VMware. In addition, Dr. Kawwas&rsquo; individual performance multiplier reflects his performance as President, Semiconductor Solutions Group in overseeing our broad semiconductor portfolio since July 2022 while continuing to lead worldwide semiconductor sales and global operations. The independent directors, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, determined that Mr. Tan should receive an individual performance multiplier of 150%, resulting in a payout of 225% of his target bonus. Under Mr. Tan&rsquo;s strong leadership, we successfully navigated through the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and the challenging macroeconomic environment and achieved strong financial results for Fiscal Year 2022. In addition, Mr. Tan and his strategic vision were critical in our entry into an agreement and plan of merger with VMware, and Mr. Tan has shown invaluable leadership in the integration planning of the pending acquisition of VMware. &nbsp; 48 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2022 APB Plan Attainment and Payout Amounts Each of the corporate and applicable divisional goals for our NEOs, and their respective weighting, is set forth in the table below.

Discretionary Cash Bonuses Each year, the Compensation Committee may supplement or substitute the APB Plan payout earned by our NEOs with discretionary cash bonuses that are awarded based on our CEO&rsquo;s recommendations (other than with respect to himself) and the Compensation Committee&rsquo;s assessment of individual contributions. Discretionary cash bonuses were not awarded to our NEOs for Fiscal Year 2022. Long-Term Incentive Compensation Our equity awards serve as a long-term reward and retention tool for our executives and are intended to reflect market practice and the value we place on their contribution to Broadcom. The philosophy behind our equity awards is to provide each executive with a strong incentive to remain with and build value in Broadcom over an extended period. The Compensation Committee believes that granting RSU and the PSU awards further the objectives of our philosophy by motivating strategic financial performance improvement and maximizing our stock price and TSR. By doing so, our executives&rsquo; interests are closely aligned with our stockholders&rsquo; interests. The Compensation Committee has historically granted equity awards under our annual equity program to our NEOs (other than our CEO) in March of each year, with 50% in the form of RSU awards and 50% in the form of PSU awards at target. Because our NEOs (other than our CEO) received the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards, they have not received regular annual equity awards since 2019. However, these NEOs are eligible to receive equity awards for events outside the ordinary course related to promotions or retention. Accordingly, in Fiscal Year 2022, these NEOs were not granted regular annual equity awards under our annual equity program. See the &ldquo; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &ndash; Elements of Executive Compensation &ndash; Long-Term Incentive Compensation &rdquo; in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020 for a detailed discussion of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards. Broadcom Inc. 49 &nbsp; Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Equity Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2022 Equity Incentive Awards Granted to Mr. Tan The Compensation Committee and the independent directors, in consultation with Compensia who was their compensation consultant at that time, focused on retaining Mr. Tan in highly competitive talent market and incentivizing Mr. Tan to continue to increase value for our stockholders. They also considered the appropriate market value for the grant of equity awards to Mr. Tan in comparison to awards granted by our peer group companies and in connection with our corporate strategy. Mr. Tan was granted two equity incentive awards in Fiscal Year 2022 to address two different priorities. The first equity incentive award was approved in September 2021 and was Mr. Tan&rsquo;s regular annual equity incentive award. The second equity incentive award was approved in October 2021, smaller in size and designed to reward significant achievement tied to our specific strategic priorities in Fiscal Year 2022 that went beyond the standard day-to-day operations responsibilities and were critical in a year when there were expectations of a possible realignment in the global markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainties. For the first equity incentive award granted to Mr. Tan, the Compensation Committee recommended and the independent directors approved an annual PSU award that vests based on our TSR performance compared to the S&amp;P 500 (&ldquo;Relative TSR&rdquo;) and absolute TSR (the &ldquo;FY 2022 TSR PSU Award&rdquo;) with a target value of $26,000,000 and effective as of and based on the closing price of our common stock on November 1, 2021. The target number of shares was determined by dividing the target value by the closing price of Broadcom&rsquo;s common stock on November 1, 2021 (rounded down to the nearest share). The award value in the &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Compensation Table &rdquo; below is $44,186,269, which reflects the accounting grant date fair value under ASC 718 on November 1, 2021. Mr. Tan may earn up to 300% of the target number of shares based on our Relative TSR and absolute TSR performance measured over the period beginning on November 1, 2021 and ending on November 3, 2024 as confirmed by the independent directors and subject to Mr. Tan&rsquo;s continued employment on the vesting date, November 3, 2024. However, if Mr. Tan retires from Broadcom on or after the last day of Fiscal Year 2022, the performance period will end on the date of his retirement notice and vest on his retirement date. The number of shares earned will be determined by multiplying the target number of shares by the achievement factor (the &ldquo;Achievement Factor&rdquo;). If Mr. Tan&rsquo;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability prior to November 3, 2024, 100% of the FY 2022 TSR PSU Award will automatically vest with respect to the target number of shares. The table below sets forth the Relative TSR and Achievement Factor for the FY 2022 TSR PSU Award. Relative TSR Achievement Factor (1) Below the 25 th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 0 At the 25 th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 0.25 At the 50 th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 1.0 At or above the 75 th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 3.0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) If the Relative TSR achieved during the performance period is between two of the levels set forth in the table above, the Achievement Factor will be determined using linear interpolation, except if Relative TSR for the performance period is less than the 25th percentile of the S&amp;P 500, the Achievement Factor will be 0. If our absolute TSR is negative, then the maximum number of shares that may be earned is 100% of the target shares. For the second equity incentive award granted to Mr. Tan, the independent directors approved a PSU award that vests depending on the satisfaction of pre-established metrics and milestones related to certain strategic objectives (the &ldquo;FY 2022 Strategic PSU Award&rdquo;) with a value of $10,000,000 and effective as of and based on the closing price of our common stock on November 1, 2021. The award value in the &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Compensation Table &rdquo; below is $9,727,179, which reflects the accounting grant date fair value under ASC 718 on November 1, 2021. The number of shares subject to the award was determined by dividing the award value by the closing price of Broadcom&rsquo;s common stock on November 1, 2021 (rounded down to the nearest share). To earn the shares, all of the pre-established metrics and milestones related to strategic objectives such as &nbsp; 50 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; corporate strategy, acquisition strategy and leadership development must be satisfied during the performance period from November 1, 2021 to October 30, 2022, as determined by the independent directors in their sole discretion, and Mr. Tan must remain employed through the vesting date, October 30, 2022. If any of the pre-established metrics and milestones were not satisfied, Mr. Tan would not have earned any shares. If Mr. Tan&rsquo;s employment had terminated due to his death or permanent disability prior to October 30, 2022, 100% of the FY 2022 Strategic PSU Award would have automatically vested. In November 2021, the independent directors determined that Mr. Tan satisfied all of the pre-established metrics and milestones and earned the shares under the FY 2022 Strategic PSU Award. Promotion Equity Incentive Awards Granted to Mr. Brazeal In December 2021, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Meridian, granted to Mr. Brazeal promotion equity incentive awards comprised of a RSU award for 8,000 shares (the &ldquo;Brazeal Promotion RSUs&rdquo;) and a PSU award for 8,000 shares (the &ldquo;Brazeal Promotion PSUs&rdquo;) at target. The terms and amounts of Mr. Brazeal&rsquo;s promotion equity incentive awards were solely designed to reflect his promotion and increased responsibilities as the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer in addition to his continuing responsibilities as Chief Legal Officer. The Brazeal Promotion RSUs will vest over four years at a rate of 25% per year on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to Mr. Brazeal&rsquo;s continued employment on the relevant vesting date. The Brazeal Promotion PSUs are earned based on our Relative TSR and our absolute TSR over four overlapping performance periods that begin on March 2, 2021 and end on March 1st of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. The number of shares of common stock that may be earned is capped at 25% of the target number of shares for each of the first three performance periods. In the aggregate, Mr. Brazeal may earn up to 200% of the target number of shares, if at the end of the fourth performance period our Relative TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 Index and our absolute TSR is not negative. No shares will be earned for a performance period if our Relative TSR is below the 25th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The Brazeal Promotion PSUs vest, to the extent earned, on each anniversary of the grant date, subject to his continued employment on the relevant vesting date. Within 60 days after the end of each performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the number of shares earned by multiplying the target number of shares subject to the performance period (25% of the total target number of shares) by an Achievement Factor. The Achievement Factor is based on our Relative TSR for the performance period. For the fourth performance period the Achievement Factor is based on our Relative TSR, as well as the sum of the Achievement Factors for the first three performance periods (the &ldquo;Prior Achievement Sum&rdquo;). However, if our absolute TSR is negative for the fourth performance period, then the maximum number of shares that may be earned is 100% of the total target number of shares. If the Relative TSR is between two of the percentile levels, the number of shares earned will be determined using linear interpolation.

Following Fiscal Year 2022, the independent directors confirmed that all of the metrics and milestones set forth in the FY 2022 Strategic Award were satisfied during the performance period and, as a result, Mr. Tan earned the 18,937 shares, which vested immediately. Additional Compensation Practices and Policies Employee Stock Purchase Plan Executives employed by our participating subsidiaries, including all of our NEOs, may also participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &ldquo;ESPP&rdquo;). Our ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire Broadcom common stock through periodic payroll deductions, at a 15% discount, based on a six-month &ldquo;look-back&rdquo; period. &nbsp; 54 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; Other Compensation The Compensation Committee provides modest perquisites and other personal benefits to our executives on a case-by-case basis. Typically, the Compensation Committee will provide a perquisite to an executive in limited circumstances, such as where it believes that such benefit is appropriate to assist in the performance of the executive&rsquo;s duties, to make the executive more efficient and effective, and for recruitment, motivation, retention or security purposes. For example, in Fiscal Year 2022, Mr.&nbsp;Tan received reimbursement for travel to his residence in Pennsylvania and a car service for business-related travel in the San Francisco Bay Area, as approved by the independent directors. For additional information on the perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs in Fiscal Year 2022, see the &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Compensation Table &rdquo; below. Severance and Change in Control Benefits The Compensation Committee believes that severance and change in control arrangements are important parts of the overall compensation program for our NEOs. Severance arrangements provide a stable work environment and are used primarily to attract and retain individuals with the requisite experience and ability to drive our success. Change in control provisions help to secure the continued employment and dedication of our NEOs, to reduce any concern that they might have regarding their own continued employment prior to or following a change in control of Broadcom and to promote continuity of management during a corporate transaction. Each of our NEOs (except Mr. Krause due to his resignation) is eligible for severance and change in control payments and benefits under their respective severance benefit agreement, including vesting acceleration of the equity awards following a Covered Termination (as defined below under &ldquo; Executive Compensation &mdash; Severance and Change in Control Agreements with Named Executive Officers; Death and Permanent Disability Policies; Retiremen t&rdquo;) in connection with a change in control, which is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;double trigger&rdquo; provision. The Compensation Committee provides such payments and benefits to our NEOs based on its review of severance practices at the companies in our compensation peer group and as the result of arms&rsquo; length negotiations at the time our NEOs commence employment with Broadcom, when they are requested to take on additional responsibilities, or from time to time if deemed necessary or desirable to achieve parity with other NEOs or otherwise. Further, we believe our double trigger change in control arrangements protects stockholder value by allowing us the opportunity to deliver a motivated management team to any potential acquirer. If we did not offer such change in control arrangements, our NEOs could be less motivated to pursue a potential acquisition even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders, due to the possibility that they would lose the potential value of their unvested equity compensation upon an acquisition. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these arrangements, as well as an estimate of the post-employment payments and benefits that our NEOs are eligible to receive, see &ldquo; Executive Compensation &ndash; Severance and Change in Control Agreements with Named Executive Officers; Death and Permanent Disability Policies; Retirement &rdquo; below. Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation Actions Equity Awards Granted in Fiscal Year 2023 On October 31, 2022 (the &ldquo;Grant Date&rdquo;), in connection with the annual equity incentive award grant review and in consultation with Meridian, the independent directors granted Mr. Tan a PSU award with the opportunity to earn up to 1,000,000 shares contingent on both achievement of formidable stock price performance milestones and continued service requirements over a five-year period (the &ldquo;FY 2023 Tan PSU Award&rdquo;). In addition, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Meridian, granted Dr. Kawwas on the Grant Date a PSU award with the opportunity to earn up to 300,000 shares with vesting terms similar to the FY 2023 Tan PSU&nbsp;Award and contingent on both achievement of formidable stock performance milestones and continued service requirements over a five-year period (the &ldquo;FY 2023 Kawwas PSU Award,&rdquo; and together with the FY 2023 Tan PSU&nbsp;Award, the &ldquo;FY 2023 PSU Awards&rdquo;). Broadcom Inc. 55 &nbsp; Table of Contents COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &nbsp; The grant date fair value of the maximum vesting opportunities for these FY 2023 PSU Awards (per ASC 718) is estimated to be approximately $161,000,000 for Mr. Tan and $48,000,000 for Dr. Kawwas. Leading Broadcom through the Next Stage of Growth The independent directors approved the FY 2023 Tan PSU Award to incentivize achievement of our long-term growth strategy and drive substantial return to stockholders by (i) aligning Mr. Tan&rsquo;s interests with those of our stockholders by shifting material elements of Mr. Tan&rsquo;s compensation opportunity to performance-based compensation and (ii) providing a significant incentive for Mr. Tan to continue to lead Broadcom, while executing critical growth initiatives, including the pending acquisition of VMware. Under Mr. Tan&rsquo;s leadership, we increased our TSR by over 3,700% since our initial public offering in 2009. Mr. Tan has been and continues to be the driving force behind our transformation from a semiconductor company into the world&rsquo;s leading infrastructure technology company that is poised to continue our platform expansion to accelerate innovation and address the most complex information technology infrastructure needs. The independent directors believe that Mr. Tan&rsquo;s leadership is a key factor for our ongoing success and growth potential, and thus, a long-term equity incentive award that motivates Mr. Tan to realize our success and growth potential is in the best interests of all of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee approved the FY 2023 Kawwas PSU Award to reflect Dr. Kawwas&rsquo; promotion as President, Semiconductor Solutions Group in July 2022 and increased responsibilities in overseeing our broad semiconductor portfolio in addition to continuing to oversee worldwide semiconductor sales and global operations, and to provide a significant incentive for Dr. Kawwas to continue to contribute towards the achievement of our long-term performance goals. Incentive Opportunities Aligned with Stockholders The FY 2023 PSU Awards are 100% at risk and deliver value to Mr. Tan and Dr. Kawwas only if our stockholders have also received significant and sustained value appreciation during the five-year performance period. The shares under the FY 2023 PSU Awards can be earned only during the period beginning after the third anniversary of the Grant Date and concluding on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date (the &ldquo;Earning Period&rdquo;) (i) if our consecutive 20-trading days closing stock price average (the &ldquo;Average Stock Price&rdquo;) meets or exceeds the pre-established and formidable per share stock price hurdles set forth below during the Earning Period and (ii) there is no termination of employment, consultancy or Board membership, except as otherwise set forth in the PSU agreements. One-third of the shares subject to the FY 2023 PSU Awards will be earned for each per share stock price hurdle attained, with no interpolation between the price hurdles. Stock Price Performance Milestone Number of Tan PSUs that Could be Earned Number of Kawwas&nbsp;PSUs that Could be Earned $ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;825 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;333,333 100,000 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;950 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;333,334 100,000 $ 1,125 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;333,333 100,000 The stock price hurdles reflect a 75.5%, 102.1% and 139.3% increase to the Grant Date closing stock price over a five-year period. If the Average Stock Price does not equal or exceed $825 during the Earning Period, the FY 2023 PSU Awards will be forfeited in full on the fifth anniversary of the Grant Date. &nbsp; 56 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT &nbsp; COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section included in this Proxy Statement, as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K.

The severance benefit agreements for Messrs. Tan and Brazeal, and Dr. Kawwas also contain alternative language that would apply to PSU awards that vest based on share price contingencies, but no such awards were outstanding as of October 30, 2022. &nbsp; Under the terms of the FY 2022 TSR PSU Award and Brazeal Promotion PSUs, as well as the PSU awards granted to Mr. Tan, Dr. Kawwas and Ms. Spears in Fiscal Year 2021, the performance goals will be based on Broadcom&rsquo;s performance through a date within 10 days prior to the change in control and the Achievement Factor will be calculated on a date before the change in control, as determined by the plan administrator of the 2012 Plan. &nbsp; If a Covered Termination takes place other than in connection with a &ldquo;change in control&rdquo; (as defined in the severance benefits agreement) of Broadcom, Broadcom must provide the NEO with: &nbsp; Name Continued Base Salary &nbsp; Bonus (1) &nbsp; Health Benefits Continuation Coverage &nbsp; Cash Payments in Exchange for Equity Cancellation (2) &nbsp; &nbsp; Hock E.

The definition of &ldquo;good reason&rdquo; generally means any of the following, subject to certain notice and cure period provisions: (A) a material reduction in the NEO&rsquo;s salary (other than as part of a broad salary reduction program instituted because Broadcom is in financial distress); (B) a substantial reduction in the NEO&rsquo;s duties and responsibilities; (C) the elimination or reduction of the NEO&rsquo;s eligibility to participate in Broadcom&rsquo;s benefit programs that is inconsistent with the eligibility of our executives to participate therein; (D) Broadcom informs the NEO of its intention to transfer the NEO&rsquo;s primary workplace to a location that is more than 50 miles from the location of the NEO&rsquo;s primary workplace as of such date; (E) Broadcom&rsquo;s material breach of the severance benefits agreement that is not cured within 60 days written notice thereof; and (F) any serious chronic mental or physical illness of the NEO or a member of the NEO&rsquo;s family that requires the NEO to terminate their employment because of substantial interference with the NEOs duties; provided, that at Broadcom&rsquo;s request the NEO provides Broadcom with a written physician&rsquo;s statement confirming the existence of such mental or physical illness. For Dr. Kawwas, a termination during the period between and inclusive of December 10, 2020 and December 15, 2023 (such period, Broadcom Inc. 63 &nbsp; Table of Contents EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION &nbsp; the &ldquo;Continuation Period&rdquo;) for &ldquo;good reason&rdquo; also includes: (A) an adverse change or reduction in either (i) their position, title, reporting responsibilities or duties or (ii) compensation, or (B) being required to report to anyone other than our CEO or the Board. Acceleration of Equity Awards in the Event of Death or Permanent Disability Upon an executive&rsquo;s death or permanent disability, Broadcom&rsquo;s Death and Permanent Disability Policies provide for the full acceleration of vesting of the executive&rsquo;s outstanding and unvested equity awards that have started vesting and would otherwise vest solely based on the executive&rsquo;s continued service, including PSU awards for which the performance criteria have been met as of the date of such death or permanent disability. Under such circumstances, any PSU awards held by executives with performance periods that have started but not ended will have their performance goals deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, with all other terms and conditions deemed met. However, pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Multi-Year Equity Awards, holders are not entitled to full acceleration of vesting of these awards except with respect to those awards for which the vesting start date has already occurred at the time of the applicable executive&rsquo;s death or disability. The Death Policy applies to all of our employees, directors and other service providers, including the NEOs, while the Permanent Disability Policy applies to (i) any officer of Broadcom, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1 and (ii) any member of the CEO&rsquo;s executive staff, including the NEOs, as determined by the CEO. The benefits provided under the Death and Permanent Disability Policies are intended to be additive to any benefits a NEO becomes entitled to under any other policy, program, plan or agreement (including severance benefit agreements), generally unless the Board, the Compensation Committee or the Policy Committee (as defined in the applicable policy) determines otherwise. Retirement Under the FY 2022 TSR PSU Award and the PSU award granted to Mr. Tan in Fiscal Year 2021 (the &quot;FY 2021 PSU Award&quot;), if Mr. Tan retires from Broadcom prior to the applicable vesting date (as noted in the table below), the performance period for each of these PSU awards will end on the date of his retirement notice and vest on his retirement date, subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals. Such retirement notice must be provided at least 30 days prior to Mr. Tan&rsquo;s retirement date. The following table reflects the potential payments Mr. Tan would be entitled to receive if he had provided a retirement notice on September 29, 2022 and retired effective October 30, 2022. &nbsp; PSU Award Vesting Date &nbsp; Shares Accelerated (1) (#) Value of PSU Acceleration (2) ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; FY 2021 PSU Award 10/29/2023 &nbsp; 135,973 64,301,632 &nbsp; &nbsp; FY 2022 TSR PSU Award 11/03/2024 &nbsp; 49,237 23,284,177 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Number of shares for which the performance goals having been deemed satisfied based on Broadcom&rsquo;s actual performance immediately prior to October 30, 2022.

For Fiscal Year 2022, the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Compensation Table ,&rdquo; is $60,606,971 and the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees is $179,156. The Ratio is 338 to 1. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee&rsquo;s compensation in accordance with SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine the total compensation for purposes of the &ldquo; Fiscal Year 2022 Summary Compensation Table &rdquo; with respect to each of our NEOs. As permitted by SEC rules, for purposes of calculating the pay ratio set forth above, we used the same median employee that we identified for purposes of our pay ratio disclosure in Fiscal Year 2020, based on our determination that there was no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio. Our median employee also remained in the same role in Fiscal Year 2020, Fiscal Year 2021 and Fiscal Year 2022. To identify the median employee, we used the following methodology in Fiscal Year 2020: &nbsp; &bull; We collected compensation data from our human resources system of record for all employees globally, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis, as of November 1, 2020, which was the last day of Fiscal Year 2020. Last year, our measuring date was also the last day of our fiscal year. &nbsp; &bull; We annualized the compensation of all permanent full-time and part-time employees who we hired between November 4, 2019 and November 1, 2020. We applied an exchange rate used in our human resources system of record as of November 1, 2020 to convert all international currencies into U.S. dollars. &nbsp; &bull; We used target total direct compensation as of November 1, 2020, as our consistently applied compensation measure. In this context, target total direct compensation meant (1) the applicable annual base salary level in effect as of November 1, 2020, (2) the annual incentive cash target amount or commission target amount payable for service in Fiscal Year 2020, and (3) the approved value of the annual equity awards granted during Fiscal Year 2020. The Ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system of record. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, this pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. Broadcom Inc. 67 &nbsp; Table of Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION Plans Approved by our Stockholders Broadcom has three equity compensation plans that have been approved by our stockholders: the Avago Plan, the 2012 Plan and the ESPP.

We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our on-going performance. Therefore, we provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of our on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of our underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating our core operating performance, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to our operations, and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from our non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. The forgoing reconciliation includes a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, &ldquo;Net cash provided by operating activities.&rdquo; Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Our free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. Broadcom Inc. A- 1 Table of Contents APPENDIX B BROADCOM INC. 2012 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (amended and restated April 3, 2023) ARTICLE ONE GENERAL PROVISIONS I. PURPOSE OF THE PLAN This 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, formerly known as the Broadcom Corporation 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, was adopted by the Board of Directors of Broadcom Corporation on February 16, 2012 and was approved by the shareholders of Broadcom Corporation on May 15, 2012. The Plan was amended and restated by the Board of Directors of Broadcom Corporation on February 13, 2014 and January 28, 2015. The Plan was amended by the Board of Directors of Broadcom Limited on February 1, 2016. The Plan was amended by the Board on April 4, 2018, was amended and restated by the Board on February 5, 2021 and was approved by the stockholders of the Corporation on April 5, 2021. The Plan was subsequently amended and restated by the Board on February 6, 2023 (the &ldquo;Board Approval Date&rdquo;), subject to approval of the stockholders of the Corporation on April 3, 2023. The Plan is intended to promote the interests of Broadcom Inc., a Delaware corporation, by providing eligible persons in the Corporation&rsquo;s service with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest, or otherwise increase their proprietary interest, in the Corporation as an incentive for them to remain in such service. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the attached Appendix. II. STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN &nbsp; A. The Plan is divided into two equity incentive programs: &nbsp; &bull; the Discretionary Grant Program, under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted options to purchase Shares or stock appreciation rights tied to the value of such Shares, and &nbsp; &bull; the Stock Issuance Program, under which eligible persons may be issued Shares pursuant to restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards or other stock-based awards, made by and at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, that vest upon the completion of a designated service period and/or the attainment of pre-established performance milestones, or under which Shares may be issued through direct purchase or as a bonus for services rendered to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). &nbsp; B. The provisions of Articles One and Four shall apply to all equity programs under the Plan and shall govern the interests of all persons under the Plan. III. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN &nbsp; A. The Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, provided, that, any discretionary Awards to members of the committee that serves as the Plan Administrator for such service must be authorized and approved by a disinterested majority of the Board. &nbsp; B. Members of the committee appointed by the Board as the Plan Administrator shall serve for such period as the Board may determine and may be removed by the Board at any time. &nbsp; C. The Plan Administrator shall, within the scope of its administrative functions under the Plan, have full power and authority (subject to the provisions of the Plan) to establish such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate for proper administration of the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs B- 1 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; and to make such determinations under, and issue such interpretations of, the provisions of those programs and any outstanding Awards thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable. Decisions of the Plan Administrator within the scope of its administrative functions under the Plan shall be final and binding on all parties who have an interest in the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs under its jurisdiction or any Award thereunder. &nbsp; D. Service on the Compensation Committee, or other committee appointed by the Board as the Plan Administrator, shall constitute service as a Board member, and members of each such committee shall accordingly be entitled to full indemnification and reimbursement as Board members for their service on such committee. No member of the Compensation Committee, or other committee appointed by the Board as the Plan Administrator, shall be liable for any act or omission made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award under the Plan. IV. ELIGIBILITY &nbsp; A. The persons eligible to participate in the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs are as follows: &nbsp; (i) Employees, &nbsp; (ii) non-employee members of the Board or the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary, and &nbsp; (iii) Consultants who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary). &nbsp; B. The Plan Administrator shall, within the scope of its administrative jurisdiction under the Plan, have full authority to determine (i) with respect to Awards made under the Discretionary Grant Program, which eligible persons are to receive such Awards, the time or times when those Awards are to be made, the number of Shares to be covered by each such Award, the status of any awarded option as either an Incentive Option or a Non-Statutory Option, the exercise price per Share in effect for each Award (subject to the limitations set forth in Article Two), the time or times when each Award is to vest and become exercisable, the maximum term for which the Award is to remain outstanding and such other terms of Awards as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in its discretion, and (ii) with respect to Awards under the Stock Issuance Program, which eligible persons are to receive such Awards, the time or times when the Awards are to be made, the number of Shares subject to each such Award, the vesting schedule (if any) applicable to the Shares subject to such Award, the cash consideration (if any) payable for such Shares and such other terms of Awards as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in its discretion. &nbsp; C. The Plan Administrator shall have the absolute discretion to grant options or stock appreciation rights in accordance with the Discretionary Grant Program and to effect stock issuances or other stock-based awards in accordance with the Stock Issuance Program. V. STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN &nbsp; A. The Shares issuable under the Plan shall be authorized but unissued Shares, including Shares subject to Prior Awards and Shares repurchased by the Corporation on the open market. Subject to any additional Shares authorized by the vote of the Board and approved by the stockholders, the aggregate number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan from and after the Effective Date shall be (i) the number of Shares subject to outstanding Prior Awards, plus (ii) 45,000,000 Shares. The maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Incentive Options granted from and after the Effective Date shall equal the number of Shares available for grant under this Section V.A. of Article One, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and the rules thereunder. &nbsp; B. No one person participating in the Plan may be granted Awards for more than 4,000,000 Shares in the aggregate per calendar year. Broadcom Inc. B- 2 Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; C. Shares subject to outstanding Awards under the Plan, which for purposes of this paragraph shall include Shares subject to outstanding Prior Awards, shall be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan to the extent those Awards expire or terminate for any reason prior to the issuance of the Shares subject to those Awards. Unvested Shares issued under the Plan and subsequently cancelled or repurchased by the Corporation at the original exercise or issue price paid per Share pursuant to the Corporation&rsquo;s repurchase rights under the Plan shall be added back to the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan and shall accordingly be available for subsequent reissuance under the Plan. In addition, should the exercise price or base price of an Award under the Plan be paid with Shares, the authorized reserve of Shares under the Plan shall be reduced only by the net number of Shares issued under the exercised Award. Should Shares otherwise issuable under the Plan be withheld by the Corporation in satisfaction of the withholding taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, exercise, vesting or settlement of an Award under the Plan, the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced only by the net number of Shares issued with respect to that Award. &nbsp; D. Shares issued under awards granted by another entity (&ldquo;other entity awards&rdquo;) and assumed by the Corporation in connection with a merger, consolidation, stock purchase or similar transaction, or issued by the Corporation under awards substituted for other entity awards in connection with a merger, consolidation, stock purchase or similar transaction, shall not reduce the Shares available for Awards under the Plan, nor shall Shares subject to such assumed or substituted other entity awards be added back to the Shares available for issuance under the Plan. &nbsp; E. If any change is made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of Shares, exchange of Shares, spin-off transaction or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation&rsquo;s receipt of consideration or should the value of outstanding Shares be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Plan Administrator to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted Awards under the Plan per calendar year, (iii) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise or base price per Share (or any other cash consideration payable per Share) in effect under each outstanding Award under the Discretionary Grant Program, and (iv) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award under the Stock Issuance Program and the cash consideration (if any) payable per Share thereunder. To the extent such adjustments are to be made to outstanding Awards, those adjustments shall be effected in a manner that shall preclude the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under those Awards. The adjustments determined by the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive. VI. CHANGE IN CONTROL &nbsp; A. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or another applicable agreement between the Optionee or the Participant and the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary, any Award that is outstanding immediately prior to a Change in Control will not vest, lapse (including, without limitation, with respect to forfeiture restrictions or rights of repurchase), and/or become exercisable (as applicable) solely as a result of the Change in Control, but will instead (i) be assumed by the Successor, (ii) continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction, or (iii) replaced with a cash retention program of the Successor that preserves the spread existing at the time of the Change in Control on the Shares as to which the Award is not otherwise at that time vested and exercisable, and such Award, as so assumed, continued or replaced, will vest, become exercisable or have any restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of such Award in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, subject to subsections (i)-(ii) below. &nbsp; (i) A Performance-Based Award shall not be deemed to have been assumed, continued or replaced in accordance with Section VI.A of Article One unless the following conditions are satisfied: (i) Performance-Based Awards for which the Performance Period has been completed as of the date of the Change in Control but have not yet been paid will be assumed, continued or replaced B- 3 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; based on actual performance during the Performance Period; and (ii) Performance-Based Awards for which the Performance Period has not been completed as of the date of the Change in Control will be deemed to have been achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels for the entire Performance Period (and not pro rata); provided that, in each case, the Performance-Based Awards will continue to be subject to any time-based vesting conditions that were applicable to the Performance-Based Awards prior to their assumption, continuation, or replacement but they will not be subject to any performance goals or metrics following the consummation of the Change in Control. &nbsp; (ii) The determination of whether an Award is assumed, continued or replaced in accordance with Section VI.A of Article One shall be made by the Plan Administrator, as constituted immediately before the applicable Change in Control, in its sole discretion. &nbsp; B. No Assumption, Continuation or Replacement of Award. &ensp;Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or another applicable agreement between the Optionee or the Participant and the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary, if for any reason outstanding Awards are not assumed, continued, or replaced pursuant to Section VI.A of Article One, such outstanding Awards will be subject to the following rules, in each case effective immediately prior to the Change in Control but conditioned upon completion of such Change in Control, with any corresponding payments made as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change in Control, but no later than within 30 days following the date of the Change in Control: &nbsp; (i) Discretionary Grant Program Awards. &ensp;All Awards made under the Discretionary Grant Program will become fully vested and exercisable. If an Optionee does not exercise all Awards made under the Discretionary Grant Program prior to the Change in Control, the Plan Administrator will pay such Optionee in exchange for the cancellation of each such unexercised Award the difference between the exercise price or base price per Share of such Award (as applicable) and the per Share consideration provided to other similarly situated shareholders in such Change in Control, with such payment to be made in cash and/or Shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion (less applicable Withholding Taxes); provided, however that if any such payment is to be made in Shares, the Plan Administrator may in its discretion, provide such Optionees the consideration provided to similarly situated stockholders in such Change in Control; provided further, however, that if the exercise price or base price of such Award exceeds the aforementioned consideration provided, then such Award will be canceled and terminated without any payment. &nbsp; (ii) Stock Issuance Program Awards that are not Performance-Based Awards. &ensp;All restrictions imposed on Awards made under the Stock Issuance Program that are not performance-based will lapse and be of no further force and effect, such that all such Awards made under the Stock Issuance Program will become fully vested. Such Awards made under the Stock Issuance Program will be settled (if applicable) and paid in cash and/or Shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion; provided, however that if any such payment is to be made in Shares, the Plan Administrator may in its discretion, provide such holders the consideration provided to other similarly situated stockholders in such Change in Control. &nbsp; (iii) Performance-Based Awards. &ensp;All Performance-Based Awards for which the Performance Period has been completed as of the date of the Change Control but have not yet been paid will vest and be paid in cash and/or Shares at such time at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion, with all performance goals to be deemed achieved at actual performance. Moreover, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Award Agreement or another applicable agreement between the Optionee or the Participant and the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary, all Performance-Based Awards for which the Performance Period has not been completed as of the date of the Change in Control will, with respect to each applicable performance goal and other vesting criteria, be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, and vest and be paid out for the entire Performance Period (and not pro rata), with the manner of payment to be made in cash or Shares at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion; provided, however that if any such Broadcom Inc. B- 4 Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; payment is to be made in Shares, the Plan Administrator may in its reasonable discretion, provide such holders the consideration provided to other similarly situated stockholders in such Change in Control. &nbsp; C. Other Change in Control Matters. &nbsp; (i) Immediately following the consummation of the Change in Control, all outstanding Awards shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the Successor or otherwise expressly continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction. &nbsp; (ii) Awards outstanding shall in no way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets, subject to Section V.E of Article One. &nbsp; (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement provision, the provisions of Section VI of Article One may not be terminated, amended, or modified in any manner that adversely affects any then-outstanding Award or Optionee or Participant without the prior written consent of the Optionee or Participant, unless for the purpose of complying with Applicable Laws or regulations. ARTICLE TWO DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROGRAM I. OPTION TERMS Each option shall be evidenced by one or more documents in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; provided, however, that each such document shall comply with the terms specified below. Each document evidencing an Incentive Option shall, in addition, be subject to the provisions of the Plan applicable to such options. &nbsp; A. Exercise Price . &nbsp; (i) The exercise price per Share shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the option grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options may be granted with an exercise price per Share of less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the option grant date pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code. &nbsp; (ii) The exercise price shall become immediately due upon exercise of the option and shall be payable in one or more of the forms specified below: &nbsp; (a) cash, &nbsp; (b) Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date and held for the period (if any) necessary to avoid any additional charges to the Corporation&rsquo;s earnings for financial reporting purposes, or &nbsp; (c) to the extent the option is exercised for vested Shares, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which the Optionee shall concurrently provide irrevocable instructions to (a) a brokerage firm (designated by the Corporation) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased Shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds, as determined by the Corporation, to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased Shares plus all Withholding Taxes to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and (b) the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm to complete the sale, or B- 5 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; (d) if Optionee ceases Service for any reason other than Misconduct and the entire exercise period applicable to the option remaining after such cessation of Service falls within a trading blackout period which the Corporation may impose from time to time, the Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, permit the Corporation (either at the time the option is granted or at any time thereafter) to (a) automatically exercise such portion of the option which has not been exercised previously on the last business day of the exercise period and (b) automatically withhold on such day a number of Shares subject to the option having a Fair Market Value (measured as of the exercise date) equal to (i) the aggregate exercise price of the Shares with respect to which the option is being exercised and (ii) the amount necessary to satisfy Withholding Taxes; provided, that such automatic exercise shall only occur if the Fair Market Value per Share on the last business day of the exercise period of the option is equal to or greater than 101% of the exercise price per Share of the option and, provided, further, that the Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to revoke or amend this Section I.A.2.iv. of this Article Two (and any related provisions in an applicable Award Agreement) at any time without the consent of Optionee. Except to the extent the procedure set forth in either Section I.A.2.iii. or Section I.A.2.iv. of this Article Two is utilized, payment of the exercise price for the purchased Shares must be made on the Exercise Date. &nbsp; B. Exercise and Term of Options. &ensp;Each option shall be exercisable at such time or times, during such period and for such number of Shares as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the documents evidencing the option. However, no option shall have a term in excess of ten (10) years measured from the option grant date. An option shall not be exercisable for any fractional Shares. &nbsp; C. Effect of Termination of Service. &nbsp; (i) The following provisions shall govern the exercise of any options held by the Optionee at the time of cessation of Service or death: &nbsp; (a) Any option outstanding at the time of the Optionee&rsquo;s cessation of Service for any reason shall remain exercisable for such period of time thereafter as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the documents evidencing the option or as otherwise specifically authorized by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion pursuant to an express written agreement with Optionee, but no such option shall be exercisable after the expiration of the option term. &nbsp; (b) Any option held by the Optionee at the time of death and exercisable in whole or in part at that time may be subsequently exercised by the personal representative of the Optionee&rsquo;s estate or by the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to the Optionee&rsquo;s will or the laws of inheritance. &nbsp; (c) Should the Optionee&rsquo;s Service be terminated for Misconduct or should the Optionee otherwise engage in Misconduct while holding one or more outstanding options under this Article Two (regardless of whether Optionee&rsquo;s Service is terminated for Misconduct), all those options shall terminate immediately and cease to be outstanding. &nbsp; (d) During the applicable post-Service exercise period, the option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested Shares for which that option is at the time exercisable. No additional Shares shall vest under the option following the Optionee&rsquo;s cessation of Service, except to the extent (if any) specifically authorized by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion pursuant to an express written agreement with Optionee. Upon the expiration of the applicable exercise period or (if earlier) upon the expiration of the option term, the option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any Shares for which the option has not been exercised. Broadcom Inc. B- 6 Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; (ii) The Plan Administrator shall have complete discretion, exercisable either at the time an option is granted or at any time while the option remains outstanding, to: &nbsp; (a) extend the period of time for which the option is to remain exercisable following the Optionee&rsquo;s cessation of Service from the limited exercise period otherwise in effect for that option to such greater period of time as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate, but in no event beyond the expiration of the option term, and/or &nbsp; (b) permit the option to be exercised, during the applicable post-Service exercise period, not only with respect to the number of vested Shares for which such option is exercisable at the time of the Optionee&rsquo;s cessation of Service but also with respect to one or more additional options in which the Optionee would have vested had the Optionee continued in Service. &nbsp; D. Stockholder Rights .&ensp;The holder of an option shall have no stockholder rights with respect to the Shares subject to the option until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the exercise price for and become a holder of record of the purchased Shares. &nbsp; E. Repurchase Rights .&ensp;The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to grant options that are exercisable for unvested Shares. Should the Optionee cease Service while holding such unvested Shares, the Corporation shall have the right to repurchase, at the exercise price paid per Share, any or all of those unvested Shares. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable (including the period and procedure for exercise and the appropriate vesting schedule for the purchased Shares) shall be established by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right. &nbsp; F. Transferability of Options .&ensp;The transferability of options granted under the Plan shall be governed by the following provisions: &nbsp; (i) Incentive Options .&ensp;During the lifetime of the Optionee, Incentive Options shall be exercisable only by the Optionee and shall not be assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of inheritance following the Optionee&rsquo;s death. &nbsp; (ii) Non-Statutory Options .&ensp;Non-Statutory Options shall be subject to the same limitation on transfer as Incentive Options, except that the Plan Administrator may structure one or more Non-Statutory Options so that the option may be assigned in whole or in part during the Optionee&rsquo;s lifetime by gift or pursuant to a domestic relations order to one or more Family Members of the Optionee or to a trust established exclusively for the Optionee and/or one or more such Family Members. The assigned portion may only be exercised by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to the assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for the option immediately prior to such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate. II. INCENTIVE OPTIONS The terms specified below, together with any additions, deletions or changes thereto imposed from time to time pursuant to the provisions of the Code governing Incentive Options, shall be applicable to all Incentive Options. Except as modified by the provisions of this Section II, all the provisions of Articles One, Two and Four shall be applicable to Incentive Options. Options that are specifically designated as Non-Statutory Options when issued under the Plan shall not be subject to the terms of this Section II. &nbsp; A. Eligibility .&ensp;Incentive Options may be granted only to Employees. &nbsp; B. Exercise Price .&ensp;The exercise price per Share shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the option grant date. B- 7 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; C. Dollar Limitation .&ensp;Notwithstanding any Award&rsquo;s designation as an Incentive Option, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Options are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Corporation and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), such Incentive Options will be treated as Non-Statutory Options. For purposes of the foregoing limitation, options shall be deemed to become first exercisable in the applicable calendar year based on the chronological order in which they were granted, except to the extent otherwise provided under Applicable Laws or regulations. &nbsp; D. 10% Stockholder .&ensp;If any Employee to whom an Incentive Option is granted is a 10% Stockholder, then the exercise price per Share shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the option grant date, and the option term shall not exceed five (5) years measured from the option grant date. &nbsp; E. Grant Date Limitation .&ensp;Incentive Options shall not be granted after ten (10) years following the Board Approval Date. III. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS &nbsp; A. Authority .&ensp;The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant stock appreciation rights in accordance with this Section III to selected Optionees or other individuals eligible to receive option grants under the Discretionary Grant Program. &nbsp; B. Types .&ensp;Two types of stock appreciation rights shall be authorized for issuance under this Section III: (i)&nbsp;tandem stock appreciation rights (&ldquo;Tandem Rights&rdquo;), and (ii) standalone stock appreciation rights (&ldquo;Standalone Rights&rdquo;). &nbsp; C. Tandem Rights .&ensp;The following terms and conditions shall govern the grant and exercise of Tandem Rights. &nbsp; (i) One or more Optionees may be granted a Tandem Right, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying stock option for Shares or the surrender of that option in exchange for a distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value (on the option surrender date) of the number of Shares in which the Optionee is at the time vested under the surrendered option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (ii) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested Shares. The base price per Share of any Tandem Rights shall be set in accordance with Section I.A.1 of Article Two and Sections II.B and D. of Article Two, as applicable. &nbsp; (ii) No such option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Plan Administrator, either at the time of the actual option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distribution to which the Optionee shall accordingly become entitled under this Section III may be made in Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the option surrender date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Plan Administrator shall in its sole discretion deem appropriate. &nbsp; (iii) If the surrender of an option is not approved by the Plan Administrator, then the Optionee shall retain whatever rights the Optionee had under the surrendered option (or surrendered portion thereof) on the option surrender date and may exercise such rights at any time prior to the later of (i) five (5) business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (ii) the last day on which the option is otherwise exercisable in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing such option, but in no event may such rights be exercised more than ten (10) years after the date of the option grant. No Tandem Rights shall have a maximum term in excess of ten (10) years measured from the grant date. &nbsp; D. Standalone Rights .&ensp;The following terms and conditions shall govern the grant and exercise of Standalone Rights under this Article Two: &nbsp; (i) One or more individuals eligible to participate in the Discretionary Grant Program may be granted a Standalone Right not tied to any underlying option under this Discretionary Grant Program. Broadcom Inc. B- 8 Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; The Standalone Right shall relate to a specified number of Shares and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may establish. In no event, however, may the Standalone Right have a maximum term in excess of ten (10) years measured from the grant date. Upon exercise of the Standalone Right, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the exercise date) of the Shares underlying the exercised right over (ii) the aggregate base price in effect for those Shares. &nbsp; (ii) The number of Shares underlying each Standalone Right and the base price in effect for those Shares shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion at the time the Standalone Right is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per Share be less than the Fair Market Value per underlying Share on the grant date. &nbsp; (iii) Standalone Rights shall be subject to the same transferability restrictions applicable to Non-Statutory Options and may not be transferred during the holder&rsquo;s lifetime, except by gift to one or more Family Members of the holder or to a trust established exclusively for the holder and/or such Family Members or pursuant to a domestic relations order covering the Standalone Right as marital property. &nbsp; (iv) The distribution with respect to an exercised Standalone Right may be made in Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Plan Administrator shall in its sole discretion deem appropriate. &nbsp; (v) The holder of a Standalone Right shall have no stockholder rights with respect to the Shares subject to the Standalone Right unless and until such person shall have exercised the Standalone Right and become a holder of record of Shares issued upon the exercise of such Standalone Right. &nbsp; E. Post-Service Exercise .&ensp;The provisions governing the exercise of Tandem and Standalone Appreciation Rights following the cessation of the recipient&rsquo;s Service or the recipient&rsquo;s death shall be substantially the same as those set forth in Section I.C of this Article Two for the options granted under the Discretionary Grant Program. &nbsp; F. Net Counting .&ensp;Upon the exercise of any Tandem or Standalone Right under this Section III, the share reserve under Section V of Article One shall be reduced only by the net number of Shares actually issued by the Corporation upon such exercise, and not by the gross number of Shares as to which such Tandem or Standalone Right is exercised. &nbsp; G. Repricing of Awards Made Under the Discretionary Grant Program .&ensp;Without first obtaining approval of the stockholders of the Corporation, neither the Board nor the Plan Administrator shall approve either (a) the cancellation of Awards of outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights and the grant in substitution therefore of new stock options or stock appreciation rights having a lower exercise price or base price, as the case may be, or (b) the amendment of outstanding Awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights to reduce the exercise price or base price, as the case may be, thereof. This paragraph shall not be construed to apply to: (i) &ldquo;issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applies&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code; or (ii) adjustments made pursuant to Sections V.E or VI.A of Article One herein. ARTICLE THREE STOCK ISSUANCE PROGRAM I. STOCK ISSUANCE TERMS &nbsp; A. Issuances .&ensp;Shares may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program through direct and immediate issuances without any intervening option grants. Each such stock issuance shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that complies with the terms specified below. Shares may also be issued under the B- 9 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Issuance Program pursuant to share right awards or restricted stock units, awarded by and at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, that entitle the recipients to receive the Shares underlying those awards or units upon the attainment of designated performance goals and/or the satisfaction of specified Service requirements or upon the expiration of a designated time period following the vesting of those awards or units. &nbsp; B. Issue Price . &nbsp; (i) The price per Share at which Shares may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator, but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the issuance date. &nbsp; (ii) Shares may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program for any of the following items of consideration that the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in each individual instance: &nbsp; (a) cash; &nbsp; (b) past services rendered to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary); or &nbsp; (c) any other valid form of consideration permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware at the time such Shares are issued. &nbsp; C. Vesting Provisions . &nbsp; (i) Shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program may, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be fully and immediately vested upon issuance or may vest in one or more installments over the Participant&rsquo;s period of Service and/or upon attainment of specified performance objectives and/or upon the Participant&rsquo;s attainment of retirement eligibility (as defined in the applicable Award Agreement). The elements of the vesting schedule applicable to any unvested Shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and incorporated into the Award Agreement. Shares may also be issued under the Stock Issuance Program pursuant to share right awards or restricted stock units that entitle the recipients to receive the Shares underlying those awards and/or units upon the attainment of designated performance goals or the satisfaction of specified Service requirements or upon the Participant&rsquo;s attainment of retirement eligibility (as defined in the applicable Award Agreement) or upon the expiration of a designated time period following the vesting of those awards or units, including (without limitation) a deferred distribution date following the termination of the Participant&rsquo;s Service. &nbsp; (ii) The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority to structure one or more Awards under the Stock Issuance Program so that the Shares subject to those Awards shall vest (or vest and become issuable) upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals, including, without limitation, goals based on total stockholder return. Such performance goals may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of the Corporation&rsquo;s performance relative to the performance of other entities and may also be based on the performance of any or all of the Corporation&rsquo;s business groups or divisions thereof or any Parent or Subsidiary. Performance goals may include a minimum threshold level of performance below which no award will be earned, levels of performance at which specified portions of an award will be earned, and a maximum level of performance at which an award will be fully earned. The Plan Administrator may provide that, if the actual level of attainment for any performance objective is between two specified levels, the amount of the award attributable to that performance objective shall be interpolated on a straight-line basis. &nbsp; (iii) Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property that the Participant may have the right to receive with respect to the Participant&rsquo;s unvested Shares by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination of Shares, exchange of Shares, spin-off transaction or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation&rsquo;s receipt of consideration or a substantial reduction in the value of outstanding Shares as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, shall be issued subject to (i) the Broadcom Inc. B- 10 Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; same vesting requirements applicable to the Participant&rsquo;s unvested Shares and (ii) such escrow arrangements as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate. &nbsp; (iv) The Participant shall have the right to vote unvested Shares issued to the Participant under the Stock Issuance Program. The Participant shall not have the right to vote the Shares subject to a restricted stock unit or share right award until that award vests and the Shares are actually issued thereunder. Dividend-equivalent units may be credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom Shares, on outstanding unvested Shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program or restricted stock unit or share right awards, subject to such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate, provided that any applicable dividend and dividend equivalent amounts with respect to unvested Shares or any Share underlying any Award may be accrued but not paid to a Participant until all conditions or restrictions relating to such Share have been satisfied or lapsed and shall be forfeited if all of such conditions or restrictions are never satisfied or lapse. &nbsp; (v) Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement, should the Participant cease to remain in Service while holding one or more unvested Shares issued under the Stock Issuance Program or a restricted stock unit award or share right award under the Stock Issuance Program or should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested Shares, then those Shares shall be immediately surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, the Participant shall have no further stockholder rights with respect to those Shares, and/or no Shares or other consideration shall actually be issued to the Participant in satisfaction of such awards, as applicable. To the extent the surrendered Shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration paid in cash, cash equivalent or otherwise, the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the same amount and form of consideration as the Participant paid for the surrendered Shares. &nbsp; (vi) The Plan Administrator may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested Shares that would otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant&rsquo;s Service or the non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those Shares. The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority to issue vested Shares under one or more outstanding share right awards or restricted stock units as to which the designated performance goals or Service requirements have not been attained or satisfied. Such waiver may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant&rsquo;s cessation of Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance objectives. ARTICLE FOUR MISCELLANEOUS I. TAX WITHHOLDING &nbsp; A. Corporation&rsquo;s obligation to deliver Shares upon the issuance, exercise or vesting of Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the satisfaction, as determined by the Corporation, of all Withholding Taxes. The Corporation shall have the right to determine the manner in which Withholding Taxes are provided for, and need not apply the same manner of providing for Withholding Taxes for all Optionees or Participants. &nbsp; B. In addition to the automatic withholding provision set forth in Section I.A.2.iv of Article Two, the Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, provide any or all Optionees or Participants to whom Awards are made under the Plan with the right to utilize the following methods to satisfy all or part of the Withholding Taxes to which those holders may become subject in connection with the issuance, exercise or vesting of those Awards. &nbsp; (i) Share Withholding .&ensp;The election to have the Corporation withhold, from the Shares otherwise issuable upon the issuance, exercise or vesting of those Awards a portion of those Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the percentage of the Withholding Taxes (not to exceed one B- 11 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents APPENDIX B &nbsp; &nbsp; hundred percent (100%)) designated by the Optionee or Participant and make a cash payment equal to such Fair Market Value directly to the appropriate taxing authorities on such individual&rsquo;s behalf. The Shares so withheld shall not reduce the number of Shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. &nbsp; (ii) Share Delivery .&ensp;The election to deliver to the Corporation, at the time the Award is issued, exercised or vests, one or more Shares previously acquired by such Optionee or Participant (other than in connection with the issuance, exercise or vesting triggering the Withholding Taxes) with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the percentage of the Withholding Taxes (not to exceed one hundred percent (100%)) designated by such holder. The Shares so delivered shall not be added to the Shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. &nbsp; (iii) Cash Payment by the Optionee or Participant .&ensp;The election for the Optionee or Participant to tender to the Corporation a cash payment equal to the percentage of the Withholding Taxes (not to exceed one hundred percent (100%)) designated by such holder. II. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 409A OF THE CODE The Plan as well as payments and benefits under the Plan are intended to be exempt from, or to the extent subject thereto, to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted in accordance therewith. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, an Optionee or Participant shall not be considered to have terminated Service with the Corporation, or a Parent or Subsidiary, for purposes of the Plan and no payment shall be due to the Optionee or Participant under the Plan or any Award until the Optionee or Participant would be considered to have incurred a &ldquo;separation from service&rdquo; from the Corporation, its Parent or any Subsidiary within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Any payments described in the Plan that are due within the &ldquo;short term deferral period&rdquo; as defined in Section 409A of the Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless Applicable Laws require otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent that any Awards are payable upon a separation from service and such payment would result in the imposition of any individual tax and penalty interest charges imposed under Section 409A of the Code, the settlement and payment of such awards (or other amounts) shall instead be made on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following such separation from service (or death, if earlier). Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Plan shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. The Corporation makes no representation that any or all of the payments or benefits described in this Plan will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any such payment. The Optionee or the Participant (as applicable) shall be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A. III. SHARE ESCROW/LEGENDS Unvested Shares issued under the Plan may, in the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s discretion, be held in escrow by the Corporation until the Participant&rsquo;s interest in such Shares vests or may be issued directly to the Participant with restrictive legends on the certificates evidencing those unvested Shares. IV. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF THE PLAN &nbsp; A. The Plan shall be effective immediately on the Effective Date. &nbsp; B. The Plan shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which all Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall have been issued as fully-vested Shares or (ii) the termination of all outstanding Awards in connection with a Change in Control. All Awards outstanding at the time of Plan termination shall continue to have force and effect in accordance with the provisions of the documents evidencing such Awards. Broadcom Inc. B- 12 Table of Contents APPENDIX B V. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN The Board shall have complete and exclusive power and authority to amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects. However, no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights and obligations with respect to Awards at the time outstanding under the Plan unless the Optionee or the Participant consents to such amendment or modification. In addition, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment to the Plan that (i) materially increases the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) materially expands the class of individuals eligible to receive option grants or other awards under the Plan, (iii) materially increases the benefits accruing to the Optionees and Participants under the Plan or materially reduces the price at which Shares may be issued or purchased under the Plan, (iv) materially extends the term of the Plan, (v) expands the types of awards available for issuance under the Plan, or (vi) would require stockholder approval under any Applicable Laws, rules or regulations. In addition, the Board may not amend the Plan to remove the requirement for stockholder approval of any form of repricing of Awards made under the Discretionary Grant Program, as specified in Section IV of Article&nbsp;Two. VI. USE OF PROCEEDS Any cash proceeds received by the Corporation from the sale of Shares under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes. VII. REGULATORY APPROVALS &nbsp; A. The implementation of the Plan, the grant of any Award and the issuance of Shares in connection with the issuance, exercise or vesting of any Award made under the Plan shall be subject to the Corporation&rsquo;s procurement of all approvals and permits required by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Plan, the Awards made under the Plan and the Shares issuable pursuant to those Awards. &nbsp; B. No Shares or other assets shall be issued or delivered under the Plan unless and until there shall have been compliance with all applicable requirements of Federal, state and foreign securities and other laws or regulations, including the filing and effectiveness of the Form S-8 registration statement for the Shares issuable under the Plan, and all applicable listing requirements of any stock exchange on which Common Stock is then listed for trading. VIII. NO EMPLOYMENT/SERVICE RIGHTS Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon the Optionee or the Participant any right to continue in Service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining such person) or of the Optionee or the Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person&rsquo;s Service at any time for any reason, with or without cause.
