This will allow us to focus on what we are here for: serving our clients and communities around the world.

These results primarily reflected lower revenue and a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by slightly lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $6.0 billion compared with $7.6 billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment1 (“FVA”) framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes. This change reflects an industry migration towards incorporating the cost or benefit of funding into their valuation; the majority of this adjustment relates to uncollateralized derivatives. Net revenue also included a $536 million loss from debit valuation adjustments1 (“DVA”) on structured notes and derivative liabilities, compared with a loss from DVA of $567 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of both FVA1 and DVA1, net income was $2.1 billion, down 11% compared with the prior year, and net revenue was $8.0 billion, down 2% compared with the prior year. Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, down 4% from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year, driven by lower debt underwriting fees of $801 million, down 19% from a record prior year, and by lower advisory fees of $434 million, down 7% from the prior year. This was predominantly offset by higher equity underwriting fees of $436 million, up 65% from the prior year, on strong market issuance and improved market share. Treasury Services revenue was $1.0 billion, down 7% compared with the prior year, driven by lower trade finance revenue. Lending revenue was $373 million, primarily reflecting net interest income on retained loans, fees on lending-related commitments, and gains on securities received from restructured loans. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $3.0 billion, down 33% from the prior year. Combined Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $4.1 billion, flat compared with the prior year. In the prior year, Fixed Income Markets also included a modest loss from the synthetic credit portfolio. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, up 3% from the prior year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services revenue, due largely to higher assets under custody and higher deposits. Credit Adjustments & Other revenue was a loss of $2.1 billion, driven by the impact of both FVA1 and DVA1, compared with a loss of $586 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by DVA1. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19 million, compared with a benefit of $445 million in the prior year. The prior year included recoveries and a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, both related to certain restructured nonperforming loans. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.15%, compared with 1.19% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 2.02%, compared with 2.52% in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $4.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to lower compensation expense. The compensation ratio was 27%, excluding the impact of FVA1 and DVA1.

Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, an increase of $302 million, or 16%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, higher headcount-related2 expense and costs related to the control agenda.

See notes on pages 12 and 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23,156 million, $23,117 million, and $23,653 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, third quarter of 2013, and fourth quarter of 2012, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.3 billion, down $414 million from the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher taxes resulting from non-deductible penalties incurred and a lower benefit related to tax adjustments, which were partially offset by lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $24.1 billion, down $266 million, or 1%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, flat compared with the prior year. The current-quarter included a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment1 (“FVA”) framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes, and a $536 million loss from debit valuation adjustments1 (“DVA”) on structured notes and derivative liabilities. Net interest income was $11.1 billion, down $203 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower loan yields and lower trading and investment securities balances, partially offset by higher investment securities yields and lower financing costs. The provision for credit losses was $104 million, down $552 million from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $65 million, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses, compared to a $700 million reduction in the prior year, due to favorable delinquency trends and lower estimated losses in mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.44% and 1.99%, respectively. The decrease in consumer net charge- offs was primarily due to improved delinquency trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was an expense of $39 million, compared with a benefit of $430 million in the prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $22 million, compared with net recoveries of $158 million in the prior year, resulting in a net charge- off rate of 0.03% and a net recovery rate of 0.21%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 1.80%, compared with 2.43% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.7 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $10.4 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. Noninterest expense was $15.6 billion, down $495 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower servicing expense. The current quarter included approximately $847 million of legal expense, compared with $1.2 billion of legal expense in the prior year. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Basel I Tier 1 common ratio1 was 10.7% Headcount was 251,196, a decrease of 7,557, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm presents below net income and earnings per share excluding certain reported significant items. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Firm’s reported results. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an additional presentation of the Firm's performance. The tables below provide a reconciliation of reported results to these non-GAAP measures. Three months ended December 31, 2013 In billions Per-share amounts Reported: Net income $ 5.3 $ 1.30 Adjustments: Gain on sale of Visa shares (0.8) (0.21) Gain on sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza (0.3) (0.08) Firmwide legal expense 1.1 0.27 Reduced reserves in Real Estate Portfolios & Card Services (0.8) (0.20) FVA and DVA 1.2 0.32 As adjusted: Net income $ 5.7 $ 1.40 Three months ended December 31, 2012 In billions Per-share amounts Reported: Net income $ 5.7 $ 1.39 Adjustments: DVA 0.3 0.09 Reduced reserves in Real Estate Portfolios (0.4) (0.11) Expense for mortgage-related matters, predominantly IFR1 0.5 0.14 Benefit for tax adjustments (0.6) (0.16) As adjusted: Net income $ 5.5 $ 1.35 1 Independent Foreclosure Review Twelve months ended December 31, 2013 In billions Per-share amounts Reported: Net income $ 17.9 $ 4.35 Adjustments: Gain on sale of Visa shares (0.8) (0.21) Gain on sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza (0.3) (0.08) Firmwide legal expense1 1.1 0.27 Corporate legal expense2 7.6 1.92 Reduced reserves in CCB (3.4) (0.86) FVA and DVA 1.2 0.31 As adjusted: Net income $ 23.3 $ 5.70 1 4Q13 2 2Q13 and 3Q13 b. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the lines of business. c. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2013, $5.0 billion at September 30, 2013, and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2012. In Corporate & Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of- period loans is calculated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage. d. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”), tangible book value per share (“TBVS”), Tier 1 common under Basel I and III rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVS represents the Firm’s tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares. Tier 1 common under Basel I and III rules, and SLR are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position and liquidity. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. For additional information on Tier 1 common under Basel I and III, see Regulatory capital on pages 117-119 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and on pages 61-65 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. All of the aforementioned measures are useful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors. e. In Consumer & Community Banking, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented include loans held-for-sale. f. Corporate & Investment Bank provides several measures which exclude the impact of funding valuation adjustments ("FVA") (effective 4Q13) and debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) on: net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, overhead ratio and return on equity. These measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Consumer & Community Banking deposit rankings are based on the FDIC 2013 Summary of Deposits survey per SNL Financial. Accounts include checking accounts and Chase LiquidSM cards. c. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense of Mortgage Production. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the third quarter of 2013. e. In Commercial Banking, effective January 1, 2013, whole loan financing agreements, previously reported as other assets, were reclassified as loans. For the three months ended December 31, 2013, September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, the impact on period-end loans was $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and the impact on average loans was $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. f. Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of Asset Management against the performance of its respective peers. g. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.
