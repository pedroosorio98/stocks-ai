Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 New York, October 13, 2011 – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported third- quarter 2011 net income of $4.3 billion, compared with net income of $4.4 billion in the third quarter of 2010. Earnings per share were $1.02, compared with $1.01 in the third quarter of 2010. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Of ficer, commented: “The Firm reported third- quarter net income of $4.3 b illion, representing a 13% return on tang ible common equity 1. It is notable that these results in cluded several significant items(), including a $542 million pretax loss in Private Equity, $1.0 billion pretax of ad ditional litigation expense in Corporate and a $1.9 billion pretax DVA gain. The DVA gain reflects an adjustment for the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads which could reverse in future periods and does not rela te to the underlying operations of the company. All things considered, we believe the Firm’s returns were reasonable given the current environment.” Further commenting on business results, Dimon said : “The Investment Bank’s revenue, excluding the DVA gain, was down substantially; however, we are gratified that the business maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Ba nking Fees, and we believe that we have maintained a healthy share of the global sales and trading market. Retail Financial Services demonstrated good underlying performance, with solid revenue an d increased deposits in Consumer & Business Banking and strong retail mortgage origination volumes in our Mo rtgage Banking business. In our Card business, credit card sales volume, excl uding Commercial Card, was up 10% compared with the prior year. Commercial Banking reported continued loan growth, including middle-market loan balances up 18% compared with the prior year, and record deposit 2 balances of $180.3 billion were up 31% compared with the prior year. In Treasu ry & Securities Services, trade finance loans increased 69% to $30.1 billion, and deposit 2 balances increased 41% to $341.1 billion. Corporate/Private Equity results were negativ ely affected by market conditions, the Firm’s decision to take certain positions in its securities portfolio in anticipation of an eventual increase in interest rates, and additional litigation expense.” Dimon continued: “Mortgage net charge-offs impr oved slightly but remained at extremely high levels. We expect mortgage credit losses to remain elevated. The Firm remains committed to helping homeowners and preventing foreclosures . Since the beginning of 2009, we have offered 1,224,000 trial modifications to struggling homeowner s. With respect to our Chase credit card portfolio, the net charge-off rate 1 improved to 4.34% and may conti nue to improve modestly over the next quarter or so. After th at we currently would not exp ect much improvement. Wholesale credit trends remained healthy and stable.” Regarding the balance sheet, Dimon commented: “We maintained our fortress balance sheet, ending the third quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.9%. Our strong capital position allowed us to repurchase $4.4 billion of common stock 2 during the third quarter. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio was approximate ly 7.7% at the end of the third quarter. Our total firmwide credit reserves remained relativ ely flat compared with the prior quarter at $29.0 billion, resulting in a firmwide c overage ratio of 3.74% of total loans 1. The Firm’s total deposits increased to $1.1 trillion, up 21% compared with the prior year.” () The Firm also recognized a $691 million pretax net loss ($0.11 per share after-tax), including hedges, from credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) on derivative assets, due to the widening of credit spreads for the Firm’s counterparties. The Firm actively manages its exposure to CVA. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 Dimon also remarked: “JPMorgan Chase continue s to do our part to support our clients and communities. During the first nine months of 2011, the Firm provided credit to and raised capital of over $1.3 trillion for our clients, up 22% compared with the same period last year; this included $12.6 billion lent to sma ll businesses, up 71%. We originated more than 560,000 mortgages; we provided credit cards to approxima tely 6.6 million people; and we lent or provided credit of $51.0 billion to more than 1,100 not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals, and unive rsities. In addition, the Firm has been very successful in hiring more than 2,200 U.S. military veterans so far this year and has increased its net employee headcount in the U.S. by more than 13,200.” Dimon concluded: “Our shareholders should rest assured that we are being extremely cautious while navigating through this challenging economic environment. We are working hard to meet all of the requirements of the new and complex regulator y environment, and we continue to invest in the future while remaining focused on serving our clients and communities around the world.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

These results reflected higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net revenue. Net revenue was $2.3 billion, an increase of $144 milli on, or 7%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.9 billion, up by $118 million, or 7%, du e to the gain on the sale of an investment, net inflows to products with higher margins, and the effect of higher market levels. This was partially offset by lower valuations of seed capital investments. Net interest income was $418 million, up by $26 million, or 7%, due to higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by narrower deposit spreads. Revenue from Private Banking was $1.3 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Revenue from Retail was $563 million, up 16%. Revenue from Institutional was $455 million, down 10%. Assets under supervision we re $1.8 trillion, an increas e of $36 billion, or 2%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, a decrease of $3 billion. This decrease was due to net outflows from liquidity products an d the effect of lower market le vels, offset by net inflows to long-term products.

See notes on page 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23,763 million, $26,779 million, and $23,824 million for the third quarter of 2011, second quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2010, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $4.3 billion, down by $156 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher noninterest expense, largely offset by a lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $24.4 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Noni nterest revenue was $12.4 billion, up by $681 million, or 6%, from the prio r year. The increase was driven by higher mortgage fees and related income and higher secu rities gains, partially offset by lower principal transactions revenue and lower investment ba nking fees. Noninterest revenue included a $1.9 billion gain from DVA on certain structured and de rivative liabilities, resulting from the widening of the Firm’s credit spreads. This gain was pa rtially offset by a $691 million net loss, including hedges, from CVA on derivative a ssets, due to the widening of credit spreads for the Firm’s counterparties. Net interest income was $12.0 billion, down by $648 million, or 5%, driven predominantly by runoff of higher-yielding loans and spread compression. The provision for credit losses was $2.4 bil lion, down by $812 million, or 25%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in the provision refl ected improved delinquency trends across most consumer portfolios compared with th e prior year. Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $2.7 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in the prior year, re sulting in net charge-off rates of 2.84% and 4.64%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $127 million, compared with $44 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recove ries were $151 million in the current quarter, compared with net charge-offs of $266 million in the prior year, resulting in a net recovery rate of 0.24% and a net charge-off rate of 0.49%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 3.74%, compared with 5.12% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $12.2 billion at Se ptember 30, 2011, down from the prior-year level of $17.7 billion and from the prior-quarter level of $13.2 billion. Noninterest expense was $15.5 billion, up 8% from the prior year, driven by higher noncompensation expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio1 was 9.9% at September 30, 2011, compared with 10.1% at June 30, 2011, and 9.5% at September 30, 2010.  Headcount was 256,663, an increase of 19,853, or 8%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable secu rities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-per iod loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loan s; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased credit- impaired portfolio totaled $4.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $2.8 billion at September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2010, respectively. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), a non-GAAP financial measure, represents common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwi ll and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE, a non-GAAP financial ratio, measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of TCE. In management’s view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm , as well as analysts and investors in assessing the Firm’s use of equity, and in facilitating comparisons with competitors. d. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust prefe rred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, invest ors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of othe r financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Ca pital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III.” The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Base l III is a non-GAAP financia l measure and reflects the Firm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted. The Firm’s estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation by U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firm’s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirem ents, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firm’s capita l under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. e. For Card Services, supplemental information is provided for Chase, excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios, to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and delinquency rates include loans held-for-sale. 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics includ e certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessi ng financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in management’s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. d. Credit Card sales volume presented ex cluding Commercial Card, which was transferred to Card Services & Auto in the first quarter of 2011. e. Average deposit balances for Commercial Banking and Treas ury & Securities Services include deposits, as well as deposits that are swept to on balance sheet liabilities (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, time deposits, and securities loaned or sold under repurchas e agreements) as part of customer cash management programs. f. Common stock repurchases also include repurchases of warrants to purchase common stock. 3. Revised financial disclosure: Commencing July 1, 2011, the Firm’s business segments were reorganized as follows: a. Auto and Student Lending transferred from the Retail Fi nancial Services (“RFS”) reportable/operating segment and is reported with Card Services & Auto (“Card”) in a single reportable/operating segment. b. Retail Financial Services continues as a reportable/operating segment, organized in two components: Consumer & Business Banking (formerly Retail Banking) and Mortgage Banking (including Mortgage Production and Servicing, and Real Estate Portfolios). All prior-period disclosures have been revised to conform with the current-period presentation. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
