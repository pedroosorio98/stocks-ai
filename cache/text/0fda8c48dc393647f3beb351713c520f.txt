(NYSE: JPM), commented: “Every day, we put the Firm’s resources to work to help our customers, corporate client s and the communities where we do business. During 2011, the Firm provided credit 2 and raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for our commercial and consumer clients, up 18% from the prior year . We provided more than $17 billion of credit 2 to U.S. small businesses, up 52% over prior year. We raised capital or provided credit 2 of $68 billion for more than 1,200 not-for-profit a nd government entities, including st ates, municipali ties, hospitals and universities. We also provided new credit card s to 8.5 million people and originated more than 765,000 mortgages. In order to he lp struggling homeowners, the Firm has offered more than 1.2 million mortgage modifications since 2009, of which 452,000 were completed.” JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $3.7 billi on for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $4.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings per share were $0.90 for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 2010. Full-year 2011 net income was a record $19.0 billion, compared with $17.4 billion for the prior year. Ea rnings per share were $4.48 for 2011, compared with $3.96 for 2010. Commenting on financial results, Dimon said: “The Firm’s returns on tangible common equity 1 for the fourth quarter of 2011 and th e full year 2011 were 11% and 15% , respectively. We believe these returns were reasonable given the environment, although the return for the fourth quarter was modestly disappointing. Several significant items affected the Firm’s f ourth-quarter results, including a $567 million pretax DVA loss which refl ected the tightening of the Firm’s credit spreads. As we have consisten tly said, whether positive or ne gative, we do not consider DVA reflective of the underlying operations of the company.” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 “We were pleased that the Investment Bank continued to rank #1 in Global Investment Banking Fees for 2011. Consumer & Business Banking opened 260 ne w branches and increased deposits by 8% in 2011. In our Card business, credit card sales volume 2 was up 10% for 2011. Treasury & Securities Services reported record deposits 2, up 28% for 2011. Commercial Ba nking reported record deposit 2 balances, up 26%, and record net income for 2011.” Dimon added: “As the economy continues to recover, we are gratified to see signs of improvement in loan demand and credit qualit y. Commercial Banking ha d its sixth consecutive quarter of loan growth, including a 17% increase in middle-market loans over the prior year. In Treasury & Securities Services, trade loans were up 73% over the prior year. Business Banking loans were up 5% over the prior year reflecting a 24% incr ease in origination volume during 2011. Mortgage originations through the Firm’s re tail channel were strong. Finally, the Card business had continued loan growth in the fourth quarter as the Chase credit card portfolio1 ended the year with outstandings of $120.0 billion.” “Firmwide, net charge-offs were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarte r, down 43% compared with the prior year, and nonperforming assets declined by 33%. Mortgage ne t charge-offs and delinquencies modestly improved, but both remained at elevated le vels. With respect to our credit card portfolio, the net charge-off rate 1 improved to 3.93%, down from 4.34% in the prior quarter and 7.08% in the prior year. Wholesale credit performance remained stable.” Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said “We maintained our fortress balance sheet, ending the year with a strong Basel I Tier 1 Common 1 ratio of 10.0%. Our capital position allowed us to repurchase $9 billion of common stock 2 during 2011, including $950 million during the fourth quarter. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 Common 1 ratio was approximately 7.9% at the end of the fourth quarter. Our total firmwide credit re serves were $28.3 billion, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 3.35% of total loans 1. The Firm’s total deposits increased to $1.1 trillion, up 21% compared with the prior year.” Dimon concluded: “I am proud of the work our 260,000 employees ha ve done this past year to continue the Firm's 200-year trad ition of showing leader ship and responsibil ity during challenging times. JPMorgan Chase has a positive impact on th e lives of millions of people and the communities in which they live.

These results reflected lower net revenue and an increased provision for credit lo sses, predominantly offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue included a $567 million loss from debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) on certain structured and derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm’s credit spreads. Excluding the impact of DVA, net revenue was $4.9 billion and net income was $1.1 billion. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, compared with $6.2 billi on in the prior year. Investment banking fees were down 39% to $1.1 billion, consisting of de bt underwriting fees of $553 million (down 40%), equity underwriting fees of $169 million (down 65%), and advisory fees of $397 million (down 6%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $2.5 billion, down 13% (down 9% excluding the impact of DVA) from the prior year, with solid client revenue. Equity Markets revenue was $779 million, down 31% (down 26% excluding the impact of DVA) from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower market volumes. For the current quarter, DVA lo sses were $135 million in Fixed Income Markets and $27 million in Equity Markets. Credit Portfo lio recorded a loss of $31 million due to DVA losses of $405 million, offset by net interest income and fees on retained loans, as well as net CVA gains. The provision for credit losses was $272 million, driv en by net charge-offs of $199 million and an increase in the allowance for loan losses due to por tfolio activity, compared with net recoveries of $23 million and a reduction of the allowance in the pr ior year. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained was 2.11%, compared with 3.51% in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, down 29% fr om the prior year, driven by both lower compensation and noncompensation expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted, and all rankings are according to Dealogic)  Ranked #1 in Global Investment Banking Fees for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Ranked #1 in Global Debt, Equity and E quity-related; #1 in Global Syndicated Loans; #2 in Global Announced M&A; #1 in Global Long-Term Debt; and #3 in Global Equity and Equity-related, based on volume, for year ended December 31, 2011.  Return on equity was 7% on $40.0 billion of average allocated capital (11% ex- DVA).  End-of-period total loans were $71.1 billion, up 25% from the prior year and 18% from the prior quarter.

Net revenue was $6.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billi on, or 17%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $4.0 billion, down by $298 million, or 7%, reflecting lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff and narrower loan spreads. Noninterest revenue was $2.4 billion, down by $1.0 billion, or 29%, driven by lower mortgage f ees and related income and lower debit card income. The provision for credit losses was $779 million, a decrease of $1.6 billion from the prior year and a decrease of $248 million from the prior quarter, and included a $230 million net reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The net change in the allowance reflects a reduction of $1.0 billion in the allowance related to the non-credit- impaired portfolio, as estimated lo sses in that portfolio declined, predominantly offset by an increase of $770 million reflecting additional impairment of the Washington Mutual purchased credit-impaired portfolio due to higher-t han-expected default frequency relative to modeled lifetime loss estima tes. The prior-year provi sion reflected a higher impairment on the purchased credit-impaired portfolio and higher net charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained, excl uding purchased credit-impaired loans, was 5.71%, compared with 5.86% in the prior year and 6.26% in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, an increase of $251 million, or 6%, from the prior year, driven by investments in sales force, new branch builds and higher mortgage production costs. Consumer & Business Banking reported net income of $802 million, a decrease of $150 million, or 16%, compared with the prior year. Net revenue was $4.3 billion, down 2% from the pr ior year. Net interest income was $2.7 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, as th e impact of lower deposit spreads was offset by the effect of higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 7%, driven by lower debit card revenue reflecting the impact of the Durbin Amendment, partially offset by increased deposit-related fees. The provision for credit losses was $132 million, compar ed with $69 million in the prior year. The prior year reflected a $100 million reduction to the a llowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs were $132 million (3.02% net charge-off rate), compared with $169 million (4.04% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, up 6% from the prior year, due to investments in sales force and new branch builds. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Checking accounts totaled 26.6 million, down 2% compared with the prior year, driven by the attrition of converted WaMu Free Checking accounts; and were flat compared with the prior quarter.  Average total deposits were $367.9 billion, up 7% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter.  Deposit margin was 2.76%, compared with 2.96% in the prior year and 2.82% in the prior quarter.  End-of-period Business Banking loans we re $17.7 billion, up 5% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter; originations were $1.4 billion, down 3% from the prior year and 4% from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of credit cards were down 28% from the prior year and 13% from the prior quarter.  Branch sales of investment products decr eased 23% from the prior year and 8% from the prior quarter.  Client investment assets, excluding depos its, increased 4% fr om both the prior year and the prior quarter.  Number of active mobile customers increased 57% compared with the prior year and 16% compared with the prior quarter.  Number of branches was 5,508, an increase of 240 from the pr ior year and 112 from the prior quarter.

Mortgage production pretax income was $161 milli on, a decrease of $392 million, or 71%, from the prior year. Production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $269 million, or 20%, from the prior year, re flecting narrower margins and lower volumes. Production expense was $518 million, an increase of $82 million, or 19%, reflecting a shift to higher-cost originations within the retail channel as well as enhanced underwriting processes. Repurchase losses were $390 million, compared with repurchase losses of $349 million in the prior year. The higher losses were primarily driven by an acceleration of Agency demands. Mortgage servicing resulted in a pretax loss of $586 million, compared with pretax income of $14 million in the prior year, largely due to mortga ge servicing rights (“MSR”) risk management loss. Servicing-related revenue was $1.1 billion, a dec line of 9% from the prior year, as a result of the decline in third-party loans serviced. MSR asset amortization was $406 million, compared with $555 million in the prior year; this reflected reduced amortization as a result of a lower MSR asset value. Servicing expense was $925 million, a decrea se of $33 million, or 3% from the prior year. The prior-year servicing expens e included $374 million related to fo reclosure-related matters. MSR risk management was a loss of $377 million, down $667 million compared with the prior year.

The improvement was driven by a lo wer provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. Net revenue was $1.1 billion, down by $269 million, or 20% , from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income as a result of lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. The provision for credit losses was $646 million, comp ared with $2.3 billion in the prior year, and included a net reduction of the allowance for lo an losses of $230 million. The net change in the allowance reflected a reduction of $1.0 billion in the allowance related to the non-credit-impaired portfolio as estimated losses declined, predominantly offset by an increase of $770 million reflecting additional impairment of the Wash ington Mutual purchased credit-i mpaired portfolio due to higher- than-expected default frequency relative to modeled lifetime loss estimates. The prior-year provision reflected a higher impairment of the purchased cr edit-impaired portfolio and higher net charge-offs. Home equity net charge-offs were $579 million (2.90% net charge-off rate 1), compared with $792 million (3.48% net charge-off rate1) in the prior year.

News Release 8 Net revenue was $4.8 billion, a decrease of $258 milli on, or 5%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.5 billion, down $438 million, or 11%, fr om the prior year. The decrease was driven by narrower loan spreads and lower average loan balances, partially offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower ne t charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of $180 million, or 16%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by lower partner revenue-sharing reflecting the impact of the Kohl’s portfolio sale, higher net interchange inco me, and the transfer of the Commercial Card business to Card from Treasur y & Securities Services in the first quarter of 2011; these factors were partially offset by lo wer revenue from fee-base d products. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, noninterest revenue increased 10%. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, compared with $709 million in the prior year and $1.3 billion in the prior quarter.

Compared with the prior quarter, net income decreased by $55 million, or 18%, primarily driven by higher Global Corporate Bank (“GCB”) credit allocation expense and provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of $109 milli on, or 6%, from the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, net revenue was up 9%. Treasury Services (“TS”) net revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $98 million, or 10%. The increase was driven by higher deposit balances and higher trade loan volumes, part ially offset by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to Card in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of the Commercial Card business, TS net revenue increased 17%. Worl dwide Securities Services net revenue was $971 million, an increase of 1% compared with the prior year. TSS generated firmwide net revenue 2 of $2.7 billion, including $1.7 bi llion by TS; of that amount, $1.1 billion was recorded in TS, $600 million in Commercial Banking, and $69 million in other lines of business. The remaining $971 million of firmwi de net revenue was recorded in Worldwide Securities Services. The provision for credit losses was $19 million, reflecting growth in trade loans. Noninterest expense was $1.6 billio n, an increase of $93 million, or 6%, from the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by expenses related to exiting unprofitable busine ss, partially offset by the transfer of the Commercial Card business to Card. Excluding the Comm ercial Card business, TSS noninterest expense increased by 11%. Results for the quarter included a $60 million cred it allocation expense, primarily driven by net charge-offs related to the traditional credit portfo lio for GCB clients that are managed jointly by IB and TSS.

These results reflected lower net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $2.3 billion, a decrease of $329 m illion, or 13%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.8 billion, down by $394 million, or 18%, due to lower performance fees, lower loan- related revenue, the effect of lower market levels and lower valuations of seed capital investments. Net interest income was $446 million, up by $65 m illion, or 17%, due to higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by narrower deposit spreads. Revenue from Private Banking was $1.2 billion, down 12% from the prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $558 million, down 17%. Revenue from Retail was $514 million, down 9%. Assets under supervision we re $1.9 trillion, an increa se of $81 billion, or 4% , from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.3 trillion, an increas e of $38 billion, or 3%, from the prior year. Both increases were due to net inflows to long-t erm and liquidity products, partially offset by the impact of lower market levels.

Private Equity reported a net loss of $89 million, compared with net income of $178 million in the prior year. Net revenue was negative $113 million, dr iven by write-downs on private investments. Net revenue declined by $468 million compared with the prior year due to the absence of prior-year gains from sales. Noninterest expense was $28 m illion, a decrease of $49 million from the prior year. Corporate reported net income of $312 million, compared with a net loss of $149 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $811 million, a decrease of $465 million, reflecting lower securities gains, partially offset by higher net interest income, reflecting higher securities balances and active deployment of the Firm’s excess cash position. S ecurities gains were $54 million in the current quarter, compared with $1.2 billion in the prior y ear. Noninterest expense of $902 million was down from $1.6 billion in the prior year, primarily reflec ting lower litigation expens e.

See notes on page 14 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $21,471 million, $23,763 million, and $26,098 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, third quarter of 2011, and fourth quarter of 2010, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $3.7 billion, down by $1.1 billion, or 23%, from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower net revenue, largely offset by lower noninterest expense and a lower provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $22.2 billion, down by $4.5 billion, or 17%, compared with the prior year. Net revenue included a $567 million loss from DVA on cer tain structured and derivative liabilities J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 resulting from the tightening of the Firm’s cred it spreads. Noninterest revenue was $9.9 billion, down by $4.6 billion, or 32%, from the prior year. Th e decrease was driven by lower securities gains, lower principal transactions revenue, lowe r mortgage fees and related income and lower investment banking fees, partially offset by higher lending and depo sit-related fees. Net interest income was $12.3 billion, flat to the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, down by $859 million, or 28%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, compar ed with $3.1 billion in the prior year. The decrease in the provision reflect ed improved delinquency trends across most consumer portfolios compared with the prior year, partially offset by the impact of a larger net reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the prior year. Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $2.6 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 2.74% and 4.89%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $353 million, an increase of $439 million when compared with a benefit of $86 million in the prior year, primarily related to loan growth. Wholesale net charge-offs were $346 million, compared with $271 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.52% and 0.49%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 3.35%, compared with 4.46% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $11.0 billion at December 31, 2011, down from the prior-year level of $16.6 billion and from the prior-quarter level of $12.2 billion. Noninterest expense was $14.5 billion, down 9% from the prior year, driven by lower noncompensation expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Basel I Tier 1 Common ratio 1 was 10.0% at December 31, 2011, compared with 9.9% at September 30, 2011, and 9.8% at December 31, 2010.  Headcount was 260,157, an increase of 20,326, or 8%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully tax equivalent (“ FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that r eceive tax credits are presente d in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxa ble and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-o ff rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased credit-impaired port folio totaled $5.7 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011, and December 31, 2010, respectively. c. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust prefer red capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, invest ors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III.” The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted. The Firm’s estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implemen tation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firm ’s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management , investors and analysts to compare the Firm’s capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. d. In Card Services, supplemental information is prov ided for Chase, excluding the Washington Mutual and Commercial Card portfolios, to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off rate and 30+ delinquency rate presented include loans held-for-sale. 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in management’s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that mana gement uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. d. Credit card sales volume is presented ex cluding Commercial Card, which was transferred to Card Services & Auto in the first quarter of 2011. e. Deposit balances for Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services are shown on an average basis and include deposits, as well as deposits that are swept to on-balance sheet liabilities (e.g., commercial paper, federal J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 funds purchased, time deposits, and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements) as part of customer cash management programs. f. Common stock repurchases also include repurchases of warrants to purchase common stock. Common stock and warrant repurchases are presented on a trade-date basis. g. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses, reflecting loans and increased lines of credit, represents that provided by Consumer & Business Banking, Card Services and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to not- for-profit and government entities, including states, muni cipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Investment Bank and is in addition to the $257 billion provided to other Investment Bank clients. Asset Management clients include individuals as well as related businesses. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 16 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
