News Release 2 In the discussion of results below of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm and of its business segments, information is presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 5. Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the second quarter of 2016 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Net revenue on a reported basis totaled $24.4 billion, $23.2 billion, and $23.8 billion for the second quarter of 2016, first quarter of 2016, and second quarter of 2015, respectively. Results for JPM 1Q16 2Q15 ($ millions, except per share data) 2Q16 1Q16 2Q15 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net revenue - managed $ 25,214 $ 24,083 $ 24,531 $ 1,131 5% $ 683 3 % Noninterest expense 13,638 13,837 14,500 (199) (1) (862) (6) Provision for credit losses 1,402 1,824 935 (422) (23) 467 50 Net income $ 6,200 $ 5,520 $ 6,290 $ 680 12% $ (90) (1)% Earnings per share $ 1.55 $ 1.35 $ 1.54 $ 0.20 15 $ 0.01 1 Return on tangible common equity 13% 12% 14% Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.2 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior-year quarter. Net revenue was $25.2 billion, up 3%. Net interest income was $11.7 billion, up 6%, primarily driven by loan growth and the impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower investment securities balances. Noninterest revenue of $13.6 billion was flat, with the increase in CIB Markets revenue largely offset by lower revenue in Asset Management, lower CIB Investment Banking revenue and the impact of renegotiated Card co-brand partnership agreements. Noninterest expense was $13.6 billion, down 6%, driven by lower legal expense and continued expense reduction initiatives. The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, up from $935 million due to reserve increases in the current quarter versus reserve releases in the prior-year quarter, and higher net charge-offs. The Consumer provision reflected an increase in reserves primarily driven by higher loss rates in newer Card vintages, in line with expectations, as well as growth in the Card and Auto portfolios, partially offset by releases for Mortgage Banking and Student loans. The Wholesale provision reflected higher net charge-offs primarily driven by Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining and a reserve build of approximately $50 million, which reflected a net increase of approximately $200 million, driven by one Oil & Gas name in the CIB, and offsetting net releases across the remainder of the portfolio. CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (CCB) Results for CCB 1Q16 2Q15 ($ millions) 2Q16 1Q16 2Q15 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net revenue $ 11,451 $ 11,117 $ 11,015 $ 334 3% $ 436 4% Consumer & Business Banking 4,616 4,550 4,483 66 1 133 3 Mortgage Banking 1,921 1,876 1,833 45 2 88 5 Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto 4,914 4,691 4,699 223 5 215 5 Noninterest expense 6,004 6,088 6,210 (84) (1) (206) (3) Provision for credit losses 1,201 1,050 702 151 14 499 71 Net income $ 2,656 $ 2,490 $ 2,533 $ 166 7% $ 123 5% Discussion of Results: Net income was $2.7 billion, an increase of 5%. Net revenue was $11.5 billion, including nearly $200 million of non-core items, principally related to a gain on the sale of Visa Europe and mark-to-market losses on Square. Excluding these items, net revenue would have been up 2% compared with the prior-year quarter driven by higher net interest income on higher volumes. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $4.6 billion, up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth, largely offset JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 by spread compression. Mortgage Banking net revenue was $1.9 billion, up 5%, driven by portfolio growth and higher production revenue, largely offset by lower servicing revenue. Excluding approximately $200 million of non-core items, Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net revenue would have been flat, driven by higher auto lease and card sales volumes, and higher loan balances, offset by the impact of renegotiated Card co-brand partnership agreements and higher amortization of new account origination costs. Noninterest expense was $6.0 billion, a decrease of 3%, driven by continued expense initiatives and lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, an increase of $499 million, reflecting a net reserve build detailed in the JPMorgan Chase section above, compared with a release in the prior-year quarter.

Net revenue was $9.2 billion, an increase of 5%. Banking revenue was $2.7 billion, down 10%.

Lending revenue was $277 million, down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $6.5 billion, up 13%, driven by higher Markets revenue, up 23%.

Equity Markets revenue was up 2%. Securities Services revenue was $907 million, down 9%. Credit Adjustments & Other, was $38 million, compared with $272 million in the prior year. The prior-year quarter included gains on wider funding spreads. Noninterest expense was $5.1 billion, down 1%. The provision for credit losses was $235 million, an increase of $185 million, reflecting higher reserves in the Oil & Gas portfolio driven by one name.

Net revenue was $1.8 billion, up 4%, reflecting higher net interest income from higher average loan balances and deposit spreads.

News Release 4 The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $25 million, compared to an expense of $182 million in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter benefit reflects continued strong overall credit performance in the portfolio and somewhat more stable market conditions in Oil & Gas while the prior year reflected select downgrades.

Net revenue was $2.9 billion, a decrease of 7%, driven by weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity. Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, a decrease of 13%, primarily driven by lower legal expense. The prior-year quarter also included a loss on an asset held for sale. Assets under management were $1.7 trillion, down 5%, due to the effect of lower market levels, outflows from liquidity products and asset sales.

Noninterest expense was a benefit of $273 million, down $317 million, driven by a net legal benefit in the current quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 1. Notes on key performance measures and non-GAAP financial measures: Notes on key performance measures a. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are considered key financial performance measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. b. Core loans include loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. For further information on total loans and core loans, see pages 3, 12, 16, 19, 21 and 23 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. c. Estimated as of June 30, 2016. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital rules, to which the Firm will be subject as of January 1, 2019, are each considered key regulatory capital measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Capital Management on pages 149-158 of the Firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and pages 54-60 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures d. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These non-GAAP financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. e. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense (a benefit of $430 million in the second quarter of 2016). The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
