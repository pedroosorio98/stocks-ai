Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 28, 2024 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statementsincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of resultsof operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected forany future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Significant Accounting Policies There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Fiscal Year We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025 and 2024 are both 52-week years. The first quarters of fiscalyears 2025 and 2024 were both 13-week quarters. Principles of Consolidation Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balancesand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, includingthose related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. Theseestimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant expenses in operating segments. The standard is effective for our annual reporting starting with fiscal year 2025 and for interim period reporting starting in fiscalyear 2026 retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides for new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should beapplied prospectively, with retrospective application permitted. We expect to adopt this standard in our annual reporting starting with fiscal year 2026. We arecurrently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 8 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(Unaudited) Note 2 - Leases Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2025 and 2035. Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of April 28, 2024 were as follows: Operating LeaseObligations (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2025 (excluding first quarter of fiscal year 2025) $ 221 2026 306 2027 290 2028 270 2029 236 2030 and thereafter 410 Total 1,733 Less imputed interest 206 Present value of net future minimum lease payments 1,527 Less short-term operating lease liabilities 246 Long-term operating lease liabilities $ 1,281 In addition, we have operating leases, primarily for our data centers, that are expected to commence during fiscal year 2025 with lease terms of 2 to 11 years for $923 million. Operating lease expenses were $80 million and $59 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Short-term and variable leaseexpenses for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were not significant. Other information related to leases was as follows: Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 (In millions) Supplemental cash flows information Operating cash flows used for operating leases $ 69 $ 61 Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 250 106 As of April 28, 2024, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.3 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.89%. As ofJanuary 28, 2024, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.1 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.76%. 9 NVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financialperformance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory and subsequently recognized to cost of revenue, as follows: Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 (In millions) Cost of revenue $ 36 $ 27 Research and development 727 524 Sales, general and administrative 248 184 Total $ 1,011 $ 735 Equity Award Activity The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date FairValue Per Share (In millions, except per share data) Balances, Jan 28, 2024 37 $ 245.94 Granted 7 $ 801.79 Vested (6) $ 176.59 Balances, Apr 28, 2024 38 $ 361.45 As of April 28, 2024, there was $13.2 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense. This amount is expected to be recognized over aweighted average period of 2.6 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 0.8 years for ESPP. Note 4 - Net Income Per Share The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 (In millions, except per share data) Numerator: Net income $ 14,881 $ 2,043 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares 2,462 2,470 Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 27 20 Diluted weighted average shares 2,489 2,490 Net income per share: Basic (1) $ 6.04 $ 0.83 Diluted (2) $ 5.98 $ 0.82 Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive 6 4 (1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. 10 NVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited) Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, usingthe treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share. Note 5 - Income Taxes Income tax expense was $2.4 billion and $166 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage ofincome before income tax was 13.9% and 7.5% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a decreased effect of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and stock-basedcompensation relative to the increase in income before income tax. Our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federalstatutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the positionwill be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwiseresolved with the respective tax authorities. As of April 28, 2024, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions willsignificantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Thesecontracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated othercomprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. The change in fair value of these non-designated contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominatedmonetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense. The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding: Apr 28, 2024 Jan 28, 2024 (In millions) Designated as cash flow hedges $ 1,198 $ 1,168 Non-designated hedges $ 704 $ 597 The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts was not significant as of April 28, 2024 and January 28, 2024. As of April 28, 2024, all designated foreign currency contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred to accumulated othercomprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency contracts was not significant. During the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment in othercomprehensive income or loss was not significant and the instruments were determined to be highly effective.

As of April 28, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations reflect our commitment to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply and capacityagreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets. As of April 28, 2024, we had outstanding inventory purchases and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $18.8 billion. We enter into agreements withcontract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are cancellable, able tobe rescheduled, and adjustable for our business needs prior to placing firm orders. These changes may result in costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $10.6 billion, including $8.8 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect our cloud serviceagreements to be used to support our research and development efforts and our DGX Cloud offerings. Total future purchase commitments as of April 28, 2024 are as follows: Commitments (In millions) Fiscal Year: 2025 (excluding first quarter of fiscal year 2025) $ 19,306 2026 3,438 2027 2,573 2028 2,222 2029 1,585 2030 and thereafter 249 Total $ 29,373 In addition to the purchase commitments included in the table above, at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we had commitments of approximately $1.2 billion to complete business combinations, subject to closing conditions, and acquire land and buildings. Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities The estimated amount of product warranty liabilities was $532 million and $306 million as of April 28, 2024 and January 28, 2024, respectively. The estimated product returns and product warranty activity consisted of the following: Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 (In millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 306 $ 82 Additions 234 13 Utilization (8) (18) Balance at end of period $ 532 $ 77 We have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in ourtechnology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. 18 NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(Unaudited) Litigation Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amendedcomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigationaction. Accounting for Loss Contingencies As of April 28, 2024, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, whilepossible, are not probable. Further, except as described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. 19 NVIDIA Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(Unaudited) Note 13 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion.

Note 14 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis forpurposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive artificial intelligence, or AI, Cockpit,autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud. The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions forgaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet applications. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operatingdecisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition- related and other costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expenses directly attributable to each reportable segment are included in operating results for each segment. However, our CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expenseby operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financialstatements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we haveexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics,metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models Our overall revenue, driven by data center compute, continued to grow through the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to gather customer demandindications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our data center products, including the recently announced Blackwell GPU architecture. We have previously increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers with planned receipts later this year. We continue to addnew vendors and have entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. Theincreased purchase volumes and number of suppliers and integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 continued to be impacted byshortening lead times for certain components. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceeddemand for our products or demand declines. While supply for H100 continued to improve, we are still constrained on H200. Our next generation data center architecture, Blackwell, is in production, and we plan on shipping customer samples in the second quarter. We expect to ramp customer shipments of Blackwellin the second half of the fiscal year. We believe the initial demand for Blackwell is well ahead of the projected supply for this fiscal year. We expect supply constraints for our Blackwell offerings will continue into next year. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship andsupport new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, and Professional Visualization products. We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse setof 23 AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due tomanufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newlyintroduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays.Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple productarchitectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, our Omniverseplatform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, suchas generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Global Trade In August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including HongKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and otherregions, including some countries in the Middle East. In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports toChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of ourproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice beforeeach shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of new export control restrictions in October 2023. To the extent that a customer requires productscovered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USGwill act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes inthe USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting ourbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacementproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. RiskFactors” for a discussion of this potential impact. Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic and geopoliticaldevelopments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of ourinvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuouslymanage product availability and costs with our vendors. 24 Israel and Hamas Conflict We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our approximately 4,000 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our globalsupply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact. A substantial number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Some of our employees in Israel have been on active military duty for an extended period and they or others may continue to beabsent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however,if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.

There have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage ofrevenue. Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 21.6 35.4 Gross profit 78.4 64.6 Operating expenses Research and development 10.4 26.1 Sales, general and administrative 3.0 8.8 Total operating expenses 13.4 34.9 Operating income 65.0 29.7 Interest income 1.4 2.1 Interest expense (0.2) (0.9) Other, net 0.3 (0.2) Other income (expense), net 1.5 1.0 Income before income tax 66.5 30.7 Income tax expense 9.2 2.3 Net income 57.3 % 28.4 % Revenue Revenue by Reportable Segments Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 $Change %Change ($ in millions) Compute & Networking $ 22,675 $ 4,460 $ 18,215 408 % Graphics 3,369 2,732 637 23 % Total $ 26,044 $ 7,192 $ 18,852 262 % 26 Operating Income by Reportable Segments Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 $Change %Change ($ in millions) Compute & Networking $ 17,047 $ 2,160 $ 14,887 689 % Graphics 1,241 1,046 195 19 % All Other (1,379) (1,066) (313) 29 % Total $ 16,909 $ 2,140 $ 14,769 690 % Compute & Networking revenue – The year-on-year increase was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute GPU grew 497%, due to higher shipments of theNVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform used for training and inferencing with large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Networking was up 242% on strong growth of InfiniBand end-to-end solutions. Graphics revenue – The year-on-year increase of 18% was led by higher demand for Gaming. Reportable segment operating income – The year-on-year increase in Compute & Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. All Other operating loss – The year-on-year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense. Concentration of Revenue Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 48% and 67% of total revenue for the first quarter offiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, original devicemanufacturers, or ODMs, system integrators, add-in board manufacturers, and distributors. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products throughour direct customers; indirect customers include public cloud providers, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, and public sector entities. Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 11% of totalrevenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. There was no direct customer that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Two indirect customers each represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025; one of these indirect customers purchased ourproducts primarily through direct Customer B. Both were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Our overall gross margin increased to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 from 64.6% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The year over yearincrease was primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 427%. Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $393 million and $134 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $114 million and$50 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 1.1% and 1.2% inthe first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. For fiscal year 2025, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. 27 Operating Expenses Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 $Change %Change ($ in millions) Research and development expenses $ 2,720 $ 1,875 $ 845 45 % % of net revenue 10.4 % 26.1 % Sales, general and administrative expenses 777 633 144 23 % % of net revenue 3.0 % 8.8 % Total operating expenses $ 3,497 $ 2,508 $ 989 39 % % of net revenue 13.4 % 34.9 % The increases in research and development expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 were primarily driven by a $482 million increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases, and a $242 million increase in compute andinfrastructure investments. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases. For fiscal year 2025, we expect operating expenses to grow in the low-40% range. Other Income (Expense), Net Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 $Change ($ in millions) Interest income $ 359 $ 150 $ 209 Interest expense (64) (66) 2 Other, net 75 (15) 90 Other income (expense), net $ 370 $ 69 $ 301 Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was due to stronger yields onhigher cash balances. Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Other, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Thechange in Other, net, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was driven by changes in value from our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regardingour investments in non-affiliated entities. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $2.4 billion and $166 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax expense as apercentage of income before income tax was 13.9% and 7.5% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a decreased effect of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and stock-basedcompensation relative to the increase in income before income tax. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources Apr 28, 2024 Jan 28, 2024 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,587 $ 7,280 Marketable securities 23,851 18,704 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 31,438 $ 25,984 Three Months Ended Apr 28, 2024 Apr 30, 2023 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,345 $ 2,911 Net cash used in investing activities $ (5,693)$ (841) Net cash used in financing activities $ (9,345)$ (380) Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certainmaturity limits on our portfolio. Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to growth in revenue. Our accounts receivable balance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 reflected $429 million from customer payments received prior to next quarter's invoicedue date. Cash used in investing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by higherpurchases of marketable securities, partially offset by higher maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in financing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of April 28, 2024, we had $31.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at leastthe next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations, $1.3 billion of debt repayment due in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, and share repurchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we canfinance future capital requirements. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. Our corporate debt securities are publicly traded withgenerally no restrictions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. Except for approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any relatedforeign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. as of April 28, 2024 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We did not make any estimated federal or state taxpayments in the first quarter and expect our cash taxes to substantially increase in the second quarter as we will make two federal and state estimated tax payments. Capital Return to Shareholders During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we paid $98 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that thedividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. On May 22, 2024, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The increaseddividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-forward stock split basis, and will be paid on June 28, 2024, to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2024.Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed 29 Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding the forward stock split. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion. As of April 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $14.5 billion of additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilutionfrom shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year. From April 29, 2024 through May 24, 2024, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $2.1 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax was not material for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program Our aggregate debt maturities as of April 28, 2024, by year payable, are as follows: Apr 28, 2024 (In millions) Due in one year $ 1,250 Due in one to five years 2,250 Due in five to ten years 2,750 Due in greater than ten years 3,500 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs (40) Net carrying amount 9,710 Less short-term portion (1,250) Total long-term portion $ 8,460 We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of April 28, 2024, no commercial paper was outstanding. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.4 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $161 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as ofApril 28, 2024. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for further information. Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligationsfrom those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Notes 2,11, and 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively. Climate Change To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcingrenewable energy or climate-related business trends. Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements There has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements. 30 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Investment and Interest Rate Risk Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of April 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to the financial marketrisks described as of January 28, 2024. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures AboutMarket Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. As of April 28, 2024, there have been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 2024. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation as of April 28, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that ourdisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide reasonable assurance. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ourinternal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade willoccur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrols, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected. Part II. Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legalproceedings since January 28, 2024. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings. Item 1A. Risk Factors Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024. Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe areimmaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed wafer, componentand capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there 31 could be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long- term supply agreements and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or ourlong-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for thefinished products are not available from third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on orders for certain supply may be extended. We have previouslyexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meetour supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supplycommitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products,or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including: • changes in product development cycles and time to market; • competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions; • changes in business and economic conditions; • sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues; • rapidly changing technology or customer requirements; • the availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure; • new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products; • new or unexpected end-use cases; • increase in demand for competitive products ; • business decisions made by third parties; • the demand for accelerated computing or AI-related cloud services; • changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies; • the demand for our products; or • government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage. Our overall revenue, driven by data center compute, continued to grow through the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. We continue to gather customer demandindications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our data center products, including the recently announced Blackwell GPU architecture. We have previously increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers with planned receipts later this year. We continue to addnew vendors and have entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers and integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Ourpurchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 continued to be impacted byshortening lead times for certain components. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. While supply for H100 continued to improve, we are still constrained on H200. Our next generation data centerarchitecture, Blackwell, is in production, and we plan on shipping customer samples in the second quarter. We expect to ramp customer shipments of Blackwell in the second half of the fiscal year. We believe the initial demand for Blackwell is well ahead of the projected supply for this fiscal year. We expect supplyconstraints for our Blackwell offerings will continue into next year. 32 Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions arecomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to shipand support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, and Professional Visualization products. We have begun a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse setof AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory ofprior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce or create volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experiencereduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial resultsmay be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers createsadditional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwiseimpact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs. Many end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and inresponse to changing market conditions and changes in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our abilityto accurately forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase productionand we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. If our contract manufacturers experience supply constraints, we may not be able to increase supply to meet customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfillour customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputationcould be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact. If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we maynot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we mayneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and mayhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of ourhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our totalsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results. We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatilityin our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because ourproducts may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace HopperSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our inability to accurately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwanand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical toour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. 33 The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began tobe used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact ofcryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes inthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increasedaftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products andreseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Additionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure bydevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affectcustomer demand. International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured,assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 48% of our revenue during the first quarter in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. We have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China. We ramped new products designedspecifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition ofnew export control restrictions in October 2023. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection ofIP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies,currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and other catastrophic events. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales tocustomers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers. We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to one direct customer,Customer A, and sales to another direct customer, Customer B, represented 13% and 11% of total revenue, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Both were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in ourportfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products thatincorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change ordelay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all ofwhich may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple OEMs,ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. Two indirect customers each represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025; one of these indirect customers purchased our products primarily through direct Customer B. Both were attributable to the Compute &Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our largecustomers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions or any difficulties incollecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. 34 Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions mayadversely impact our business. We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with suchrequirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable lawsor the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulationsto which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or furtherrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business andcompetition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also receivedrequests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China regarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additionalrequests for information in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act will likely become law this year. Restrictions under this and any otherregulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, andreduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions andcontrols on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas orother trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an exportlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws orsanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures whichblocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future. The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings. Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire,deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results. Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of exportcontrol restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated 35 products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope andapplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad andcould negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services eventhough competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financialresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negativelyimpact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers andcustomers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China. Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside Chinaand for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely toimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business. Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges.Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serveoverseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide ourproducts and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. If the regulatorsconclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor andsupercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There arealso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses inChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports toChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply tothe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,H800, and L40S products. We have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distributionoperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensingrequirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such alicense or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards oran opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. Therequirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future 36 disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for theirproducts. Management of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of thegeographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses tosignificant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or imposeburdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China topursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any timeand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In theevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USGhas already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair GPUs ifcertain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands suchcontrols to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls mayhave a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for asubstantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networkingproducts, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitorsthat sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outsideChina and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseasgovernments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also inother markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advancedsemiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictionson the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinesegovernment announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results. Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new restrictions thatnegatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $25.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program without expiration. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 9.9 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion. As of April 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, torepurchase up to $14.5 billion of additional shares of our common stock. 37 The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchaseprograms, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may besuspended at any time at our discretion. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we paid $98 million in cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the bestinterests of our shareholders. The following table presents details of our share repurchase transactions during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025: Period Total Numberof SharesPurchased(In millions) Average Price Paidper Share Total Number of SharesPurchased as Part ofPublicly AnnouncedProgram(In millions) Approximate Dollar Valueof Shares that May Yet BePurchased Under theProgram(In billions) January 29, 2024 - February 25, 2024 3.4 $ 690.11 3.4 $ 20.2 February 26, 2024 - March 24, 2024 2.3 $ 857.29 2.3 $ 17.9 March 25, 2024 - April 28, 2024 4.2 $ 875.17 4.2 $ 14.5 Total 9.9 9.9 From April 29, 2024 through May 24, 2024, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $2.1 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding We withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of RSU awards under ouremployee equity incentive program. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we withheld approximately 2 million shares for a total value of $1.8 billion through net share settlements. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds On April 19, 2024, we issued a total of 10,764 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $8.2 million based on our closing stock price on the date ofissuance, to key employees of a company we acquired, who had advised us that they were sophisticated investors. These shares were issued in a transactionnot involving a public offering pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Item 5.

NVIDIA Corporation Participant: By: Signature Signature Title: Date: Date: Attachment I NVIDIA Corporation Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement Pursuant to the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“Grant Notice”) and this Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (including any additional terms and conditions for your country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”)) (collectively, the “Agreement”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “Company”) has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “Award”) under its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan. 1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “Account”) the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock. 2. Vesting. (a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice. (b) Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement). (c) On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date. 1 3. Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock. (a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan. (b) Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award. (c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares. 4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company’s designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement. 6. Date of Issuance. (a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable. The form of such issuance (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company. (b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) and Section 6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable vesting date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests (and for purposes of this Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the “Original Issuance Date”); provided, however, that the Original Issuance Date will in all cases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline. For purposes of this Agreement, the “Issuance Deadline” means the latest of the following, as applicable: (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the applicable vesting date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year in which the applicable vesting date occurs); (ii) if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the last day of the period set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A); or (iii) any date that is permitted without incurring adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. 2 (c) If (i) this Award is subject to any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) on the Original Issuance Date, (ii) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period” applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan), and (iii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) in cash, then the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be issued on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be issued on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market or on such other date determined by the Company, but in no event later than the Issuance Deadline. 7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units. 8. Restrictive Legends. The shares of Common Stock issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise. 9. Award not a Service Contract. (a) Your Continuous Service with the Company or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you or for which you otherwise render services (the “Service Recipient”) is not for any specified term and, if permitted under applicable law, may be terminated by you or by the Service Recipient at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice. Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with the Service Recipient; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate you at any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. The grant of the Award shall not be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or the Service Recipient. (b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is earned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a “reorganization”). You further acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or 3 the termination of Affiliate status of the Service Recipient and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee or Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Service Recipient to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice, and will not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to conduct a reorganization. 10. Responsibility for Taxes. (a) You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or the Service Recipient takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Service Recipient, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the Company or the Service Recipient (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient, if any. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates (including the Service Recipient) for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. (b) In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactorily to the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or requiring you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “FINRA Dealer”) (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however, that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting 4 consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the Plan. (c) The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or the Service Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax- Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. (d) Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award. (e) In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is determined after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld, if anything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or the Service Recipient harmless from any failure by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to withhold the proper amount. 11.

No Advice Regarding Grant. The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying shares of Common Stock. You should consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding your participation in the Plan, and by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so. 13. Unsecured Obligation. Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of an Award, you will be considered an unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement upon vesting of the Award. You will not have voting or 6 any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company.

Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws. You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) or rights linked to the value of shares of Common Stock during such times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party, which may include fellow employees and (ii) “tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. You acknowledge 7 that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions and you should speak with your personal legal advisor on this matter. 19. Foreign Assets/Account and Tax Reporting, Exchange Controls. Your country may have certain foreign asset, account and/or tax reporting requirements and exchange controls which may affect your ability to acquire or hold shares of Common Stock under the Plan or cash received from participating in the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of shares of Common Stock) in a brokerage or bank account outside your country. You understand that you may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the tax or other authorities in your country.

Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included therein, the terms and conditions for such country, if any, will apply to you to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement. 21. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the Award and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. 22. Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid. 23. Governing Law/Venue. The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the law of the state of Delaware without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules.

Miscellaneous. (a) The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award will be transferable to any one or more persons or entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company’s successors and assigns. Your rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the Company. 8 (b) You agree upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in the sole determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award. (c) You acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed your Award in its entirety, have had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting your Award, and fully understand all provisions of your Award. (d) All obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement will be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 25. Amendment. Subject to Section 21 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided in this Agreement. 26. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of Restricted Stock Units that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the Award fails to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not exempt from, and determined to be deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A, this Award shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly.

The following provision supplements Section 11 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement: By accepting the Award, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan. You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion decided to grant an Award under the Plan to individuals who may be Consultants, Directors, or Employees of the Service Recipient, the Company, or one of its other Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is limited and entered into based upon the express assumption and condition that any Award will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Affiliate, including the Service Recipient, on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the Agreement. Consequently, you understand that the Award is given on the assumption and condition that the Award shall not become part of any employment or other service contract (whether with the Company or any Affiliate, including the Service Recipient) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purpose (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. Furthermore, you understand and freely accept that there is no guarantee that any benefit whatsoever shall arise from the Award, which is gratuitous and discretionary, since the future value of the Award, and the underlying shares of Common Stock, is unknown and unpredictable. Further, your participation in the Plan is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such that, unless otherwise set forth in the Plan, if your Continuous Service terminates for any reason except for your death, your participation in the Plan will cease immediately. This will be the case, for example, even if (1) you are considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) you are dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) your Continuous Service ceases 34 due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition; (4) your Continuous Service ceases due to a unilateral breach of contract by the Company or any of its Affiliates; or (5) your Continuous Service terminates for any other reason whatsoever. Consequently, upon termination of your Continuous Service for any of the above reasons, you automatically lose any right to participate in the Plan on the date of your termination of Continuous Service, as described in the Plan and the Agreement. Notifications Securities Law Information. The Award and shares of Common Stock described in the Agreement do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory. The Plan and the Agreement have not been nor will they be registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and do not constitute a public offering prospectus. Exchange Control Information. In the event that you hold 10% or more of the share capital or voting rights of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of Directors of the Company, you must declare such holding to the Spanish Dirección General de Comercio Internacional e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. Such declaration should be done by filing a Form D-6 each January while the shares of Common Stock are owned. However, if the value of the acquisition and sale of shares of Common Stock exceeds a certain threshold, the value must be declared on Form D-6 filed with the Spanish Registro de Inversiones within one month from the acquisition or sale. Spanish residents are also required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), as well as the securities held in such accounts, if the value of the transactions for all such accounts during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000. Different thresholds and deadlines to file this declaration apply. However, if neither such transactions during the immediately preceding year nor the balances / positions as of December 31 exceed €1,000,000, no such declaration must be filed unless expressly required by the Bank of Spain. If any of such thresholds were exceeded during the current year, you may be required to file the relevant declaration corresponding to the prior year, however, a summarized form of declaration may be available. You should consult with your personal legal advisor to ensure compliance with applicable exchange control reporting requirements. Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. To the extent that Spanish residents hold rights or assets (e.g., shares of Common Stock, cash, etc.) in a bank or brokerage account outside of Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset as of December 31 each year (or at any time during the year in which you sell or dispose of such right or asset), such residents are required to report information on such rights and assets on their tax return for such year. Shares of Common Stock constitute securities for purposes of this requirement, but unvested rights (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) are not considered assets or rights for purposes of this requirement. If applicable, Spanish residents must report the assets or rights on Form 720 by no later than March 31 following the end of the relevant year. After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will only apply for subsequent years if the value of any previously- reported assets or rights increases by more than €20,000. Failure to comply with this reporting requirement may result in penalties. Spanish residents should consult with their personal tax and legal advisors to ensure compliance with their personal reporting obligations. 35 SWEDEN Terms and Conditions Authorization to Withhold. The following provision supplements Section 10 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement: Without limiting the Company’s and the Service Recipient’s authority to satisfy their withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items as set forth in Section 10 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, by accepting the Award, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient to withhold shares of Common Stock or to sell shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to you upon vesting/settlement to satisfy Tax- Related Items, regardless of whether the Company and/or the Service Recipient have an obligation to withhold such Tax-Related Items.

Further, for repatriated amounts of US$1,000,000 or more, Thai residents must specifically report the inward remittance to the Bank of Thailand on a Foreign Exchange Transaction Form. Failure to comply with the above obligations may lead to penalties being assessed by the Bank of Thailand.

In this case, the amount of any income tax not collected within 90 days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Item(s) occurs may constitute an additional benefit to you on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions may be payable. You will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Service Recipient (as appropriate) for the value of any National Insurance Contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the Service Recipient collect by any of the means referred to in the Plan or Section 10 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. 38 Attachment III NVIDIA Corporation Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan 39 NVIDIA Corporation Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan NVIDIA Corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), hereby awards to Participant aRestricted Stock Unit Award for the number of restricted stock units (the “Restricted Stock Units”) set forth below (the “Award”).

NVIDIA Corporation Participant: By: Signature Signature Title: Date: Date: Attachment I NVIDIA Corporation Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement Pursuant to the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“Grant Notice”) and this Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (including any additional terms and conditions for your country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”)) (collectively, the “Agreement”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “Company”) has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “Award”) under its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “Date of Grant”). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan. 1. Grant of the Award. The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “Account”) the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock. 2. Vesting. (a) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice. (b) Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); provided, however, that: (i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement). (c) On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. In the event of your death, any Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that are not accelerated pursuant to the Grant Notice will be forfeited and returned to the 1 Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date. 3. Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock. (a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.

The Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares. 4. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 5. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company’s designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement. 6. Date of Issuance. (a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement) and Section 6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable vesting date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests (and for purposes of this Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the 2 “Original Issuance Date”); provided, however, that the Original Issuance Date will in all cases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline.

(c) If (i) this Award is subject to any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) on the Original Issuance Date, (ii) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period” applicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan), and (iii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) in cash, then the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be issued on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be issued on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market or on such other date determined by the Company, but in no event later than the Issuance Deadline. 7. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units. 8. Restrictive Legends. The shares of Common Stock issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise. 9. Award not a Service Contract. (a) Your Continuous Service with the Company or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you or for which you otherwise render services (the “Service Recipient”) is not for any specified term and, if permitted under applicable law, may be terminated by you or by the Service Recipient at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice. Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with the Service Recipient; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has 3 specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate you at any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. The grant of the Award shall not be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or the Service Recipient. (b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is earned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a “reorganization”). You further acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the termination of Affiliate status of the Service Recipient and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee or Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Service Recipient to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice, and will not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to conduct a reorganization. 10. Responsibility for Taxes. (a) You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or the Service Recipient takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Service Recipient, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the Company or the Service Recipient (“Tax-Related Items”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient, if any. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates (including the Service Recipient) for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. (b) In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactorily to the Company and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or requiring you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is 4 a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “FINRA Dealer”) (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or the Service Recipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however, that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the Plan. (c) The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or the Service Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax- Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. (d) Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.

Severability. If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid.

Amendment. Subject to Section 21 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided in this Agreement. 26. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of Restricted Stock Units that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the 9 Award fails to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not exempt from, and determined to be deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A, this Award shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly. If it is determined that the Award is deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and you are a “specified employee” (as determined under Code Section 409A) on your “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), without regard to any alternative definitions therein, a “Separation from Service”), then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of your Separation from Service) will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code Section 409A. 10 Attachment II Appendix to NVIDIA Corporation Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement Additional Terms and Conditions For Non-U.S. Participants Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan, in the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice and/or in the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. Terms and Conditions This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Restricted Stock Units granted to you under the Plan if you reside and/or work in one of the countries listed below. If you are a citizen or resident (or are considered as such for local law purposes) of a country other than the country in which you are currently residing and/or working, or if you relocate to another country after the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you. Notifications This Appendix may also include information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as of December 2023. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time the Restricted Stock Units vest, shares of Common Stock are issued upon vesting, dividends are paid on shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, or you sell shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan. In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation. Finally, if you are a citizen or resident (or are considered as such for local law purposes) of a country other than the country in which you are currently residing and/or working, or if you relocate to another country after the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the notifications contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner. 11 DATA PRIVACY PROVISIONS FOR ALL NON-U.S. PARTICIPANTS Terms and Conditions Data Privacy Consent For Participants Working and/or Residing Outside the European Union (“EU”)/European Economic Area (“EEA”)/Switzerland/United Kingdom.

You further authorize the Company, the Service Recipient and/or any other Affiliate to disclose and discuss such information with their advisors. You also authorize the Company, the Service Recipient and/or any other Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in your employee file. You further acknowledge and agree that your personal information, including any sensitive personal information, may be transferred or disclosed outside the province of Quebec, including to the United States. You acknowledge and authorize the Company and other parties involved in the administration of the Plan to use technology for profiling purposes and to make automated decisions that may have an impact on you or the administration of the Plan. Notifications Securities Law Information. You are permitted to sell shares of Common Stock acquired through the Plan through the designated broker appointed by the Company provided the resale of such shares takes place outside of Canada and through the facilities of a stock exchange, which should be the case because the Common Stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. Specified foreign property, including Restricted Stock Units, shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan and other rights to receive shares (e.g., options) of a non-Canadian company, held by a Canadian resident must generally be reported annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement) if the total cost of the specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time during the year. Restricted Stock Units must be reported – generally at a nil cost – if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because other specified foreign property is held by you. When shares of Common Stock are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the shares. The ACB would ordinarily equal the fair market value of the shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other shares of the same company, this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other shares. You should consult with your personal tax advisor to determine your reporting requirements. CHINA Terms and Conditions The following provisions apply to you if you are subject to exchange control regulations in the People’s Republic of China (“China”), including the requirements imposed by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), as determined by the Company in its sole discretion: Settlement of Award and Sale of Shares. This provision supplements Section 6 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement: You will not be permitted to vest in any shares of Common Stock unless and until the necessary approvals for the Plan have been obtained from SAFE and remain in place, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Further, the Company is under no obligation to issue shares of Common Stock if the Company has not or does not obtain SAFE approval or if any such SAFE approval subsequently becomes invalid or ceases to be in effect by the time you vest in the Restricted Stock Units. To facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements in China, you understand and agree that any shares of Common Stock you acquire upon vesting of your Restricted Stock Units may be immediately sold at vesting or, at the Company’s discretion, at a later time. You agree that the 18 Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the sale of such shares of Common Stock (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) and you expressly authorize the designated broker to complete the sale of such shares. You acknowledge that the designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the shares of Common Stock at any particular price. Upon the sale of the shares of Common Stock, the Company agrees to pay the cash proceeds from the sale, less any brokerage fees or commissions, to you in accordance with applicable exchange control laws and regulations and provided any withholding obligation for Tax- Related Items resulting from your participation in the Plan has been satisfied.

You further agree that if you do not sell these shares within 90 days after your termination date (or such other period as determined by the Company and in compliance with applicable law), the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the mandatory sale of such shares (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) and you expressly authorize the Company’s designated broker to complete the sale of such shares.

Exchange Control Requirements. You understand and agree that you will not be permitted to transfer any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan out of the account established for you with the Company’s designated broker and that you will be required to immediately repatriate to China any cash proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or from dividends paid on such shares. You further understand that such repatriation of cash proceeds will need to be effectuated through a special exchange control account established by the Company or an Affiliate in China, and you hereby consent and agree that any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock or dividends paid on such shares may be transferred to such special account prior to being delivered to you. The proceeds may be paid to you in U.S. dollars or local currency at the Company’s discretion. In the event the proceeds are paid in U.S. dollars, you understand that you will be required to set up a U.S. dollar bank account in China and provide the bank account details to the Service Recipient and/or the Company, so that the proceeds may be deposited into this account.

The following provision supplements Section 11 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement: By accepting the Award, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan. You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion decided to grant an Award under the Plan to individuals who may be Consultants, Directors, or Employees of the Service Recipient, the Company, or one of its other Affiliates throughout the world. The decision is limited and entered into based upon the express assumption and condition that any Award will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Affiliate, including the Service Recipient, on an ongoing basis, other than as expressly set forth in the Agreement. Consequently, you understand that the Award is given on the assumption and condition that the Award shall not become part of any employment or other service contract (whether with the Company or any Affiliate, including the Service Recipient) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purpose (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever. Furthermore, you understand and freely accept that there is no guarantee that any benefit whatsoever shall arise from the Award, which is gratuitous and discretionary, since the future value of the Award, and the underlying shares of Common Stock, is unknown and unpredictable. Further, your participation in the Plan is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such that, unless otherwise set forth in the Plan, if your Continuous Service terminates for any reason except for your death, your participation in the Plan will cease immediately. This will be the case, for example, even if (1) you are considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause (i.e., subject to a “despido improcedente”); (2) you are dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) your Continuous Service ceases due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition; (4) your Continuous Service ceases due to a unilateral breach of contract by the Company or any of its Affiliates; or (5) your Continuous Service terminates for any other reason whatsoever. Consequently, upon termination of your Continuous Service for any of the above reasons, you automatically lose any right to participate in the Plan on the date of your termination of Continuous Service, as described in the Plan and the Agreement. Notifications Securities Law Information. The Award and shares of Common Stock described in the Agreement do not qualify under Spanish regulations as securities. No “offer of securities to the public,” as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in the Spanish territory.

In the event that you hold 10% or more of the share capital or voting rights of the Company or such other amount that would entitle you to join the Board of Directors of the Company, you must declare such holding to the Spanish Dirección General de Comercio Internacional e Inversiones (the “DGCI”), the Bureau for Commerce and Investments, which is a department of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. Such declaration should be done by filing a Form D-6 each January while the shares of Common Stock are owned. However, if the value of the acquisition and sale of shares of Common Stock exceeds a certain threshold, the value must be declared on Form D-6 filed with the Spanish Registro de Inversiones within one month from the acquisition or sale. Spanish residents are also required to electronically declare to the Bank of Spain any securities accounts (including brokerage accounts held abroad), as well as the securities held in such accounts, if the value of the transactions for all such accounts during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the prior tax year exceeds €1,000,000. Different thresholds and deadlines to file this declaration apply. However, if neither such transactions during the immediately preceding year nor the balances / positions as of December 31 exceed €1,000,000, no such declaration must be filed unless expressly required by the Bank of Spain. If any of such thresholds were exceeded during the current year, you may be required to file the relevant declaration corresponding to the prior year, however, a summarized form of declaration may be available. You should consult with your personal legal advisor to ensure compliance with applicable exchange control reporting requirements. Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information. To the extent that Spanish residents hold rights or assets (e.g., shares of Common Stock, cash, etc.) in a bank or brokerage account outside of Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset as of December 31 each year (or at any time during the year in which you sell or dispose of such right or asset), such residents are required to report information on such rights and assets on their tax return for such year. Shares of Common Stock constitute securities for purposes of this requirement, but unvested rights (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) are not considered assets or rights for purposes of this requirement. If applicable, Spanish residents must report the assets or rights on Form 720 by no later than March 31 following the end of the relevant year. After such assets or rights are initially reported, the reporting obligation will only apply for subsequent years if the value of any previously- reported assets or rights increases by more than €20,000. Failure to comply with this reporting requirement may result in penalties. Spanish residents should consult with their personal tax and legal advisors to ensure compliance with their personal reporting obligations. SWEDEN Terms and Conditions Authorization to Withhold. The following provision supplements Section 10 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement: Without limiting the Company’s and the Service Recipient’s authority to satisfy their withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items as set forth in Section 10 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, by accepting the Award, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient to withhold shares of Common Stock or to sell shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to you upon vesting/settlement to satisfy Tax- Related Items, regardless of whether the Company and/or the Service Recipient have an obligation to withhold such Tax-Related Items. 36 SWITZERLAND Notifications Securities Law Information.

If the transaction amount is TWD 500,000 or more in a single transaction, a Foreign Exchange Transaction Form must be submitted, along with supporting documentation, to the satisfaction of the remitting bank. If the transaction amount is US$500,000 or more, you may be required to provide additional supporting documentation to the satisfaction of the remitting bank.

Further, for repatriated amounts of US$1,000,000 or more, Thai residents must specifically report the inward remittance to the Bank of Thailand on a Foreign Exchange Transaction Form. Failure to comply with the above obligations may lead to penalties being assessed by the Bank of Thailand.

It is your responsibility to comply with exchange control laws in Thailand and neither the Company nor the Service Recipient will be liable for any fines or penalties resulting from failure to comply with applicable laws. 37 TÜRKIYE Notifications Securities Law Information.

You are solely responsible for complying with this requirement and should consult with a personal legal advisor for further information regarding any obligations in this respect.

In this case, the amount of any income tax not collected within 90 days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Item(s) occurs may constitute an additional benefit to you on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions may be payable. You will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing the Company or the Service Recipient (as appropriate) for the value of any National Insurance Contributions due on this additional benefit, which the Company or the Service Recipient collect by any of the means referred to in the Plan or Section 10 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. 39 Attachment III NVIDIA Corporation Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan EXHIBIT 31.1 CERTIFICATION I, Jen-Hsun Huang, certify that: 1.
