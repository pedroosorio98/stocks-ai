Mexico's Growth and Market Disruption: Nu is in the early stages of building a full-scale retail banking platform in Mexico, surpassing 12 million customers.

In Q2&rsquo;25, we achieved another quarter of robust growth, expanding our customer base to nearly 123 million with over 4.1 million net additions, and maintaining an activity rate above 83%. This strong engagement drove revenues to $3.7 billion, representing an 85% annualized growth rate since 2021, and allowed us to nearly triple our quarterly net income to $637 million in the past two years. These results come despite our ongoing investments in growth and, most importantly, in keeping our customers loving us fanatically, proving that it's possible to scale efficiently, with discipline, and still generate strong earnings while building the foundation for the long-term David V&eacute;lez, CEO S&atilde;o Paulo &ndash; August 14, 2025 &ndash; Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Nu&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nu Holdings&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Company&rdquo;) (NYSE: NU), one of the world&rsquo;s largest digital banking platforms, today reported its unaudited results for the second quarter ended on June 30, 2025. Financial results are expressed in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), unless otherwise noted. Nu Holdings Reports Q2&rsquo;25 Financial and Operating Results Revenues increased 40% YoY FXN, to a record $3.7 billion . Nu&rsquo;s efficiency ratio rose slightly to 28.3% , reflecting the impact of two main factors: RSU expenses from the initial vesting of Nu&rsquo;s 2025 annual grant, and higher marketing investments during the quarter. Nu welcomed 4.1 million new customers during the quarter, representing a 17% YoY increase of 18.2 million and bringing total customers to 122.7 million . The activity rate remained above 83% , underscoring the depth of engagement across the Company&rsquo;s platform. Deposits increased 41% YoY FXN to $36.6 billion , with the cost of funding at 91% of the blended interbank rates for the quarter. The Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LDR) reached 43% . Total credit portfolio expanded 40% YoY FXN and 8% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) FXN to $27.3 billion , while the total Interest-Earning Portfolio (IEP) expanded 55% YoY FXN to $15.7 billion . Nu's leading asset quality indicator, the 15-90 NPL ratio for the Brazil Consumer Credit Portfolio, declined to 4.4% 1 this quarter, a 30 basis point (bps) improvement versus the previous quarter. This was in line with expectations and outpaced the typical second-quarter seasonality, which usually shows a 20 bps drop. The 90+ NPL ratio increased by 10 bps to 6.6% 1 , reflecting the rise in early delinquency observed in the first quarter and following the usual seasonal pattern. Net income reached $637 million in Q2&rsquo;25, up 42% YoY FXN, marking the highest quarterly result in Nu&rsquo;s history. This performance reflects sustained revenue growth and disciplined execution, with ROE remaining strong at 28% . 1 Data for Brazil only. 2 Key Operating and Financial Metrics A Summary of Consolidated Financial and Operating Metrics is presented for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and March 31, 2025.
