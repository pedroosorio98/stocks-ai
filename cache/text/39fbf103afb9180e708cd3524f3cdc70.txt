We deployed 4,053 MWh of energy storage products in Q1, the highest quarterly deployment yet. Decline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin. &nbsp; &nbsp; Production Deliveries Subject to operating lease accounting Model 3/Y 412,376 369,783 2% Other Models 20,995 17,027 1% Total 433,371 386,810 2% &nbsp; *** Tesla will post its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 after market close on Tuesday, April 23, 2024.
