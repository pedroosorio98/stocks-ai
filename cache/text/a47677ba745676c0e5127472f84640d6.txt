On April&#160;14, 2022, Broadcom Inc. (&#8220;Broadcom&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), completed its issuance and sale of $1,950&#160;million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;) comprised of $750&#160;million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2029 (the &#8220;2029 Notes&#8221;) and $1,200&#160;million aggregate principal amount of 4.15% senior notes due 2032 (the &#8220;2032 Notes&#8221; and, together with the 2029 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). Broadcom intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of its outstanding 4.700% Senior Notes due 2025 and 4.250% Senior Notes due 2026, and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith. Indenture The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated April&#160;14, 2022, between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;). Each series of Notes pays interest semi-annually in arrears on April&#160;15 and October&#160;15 of each year, commencing October&#160;15, 2022. The Notes were offered in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Optional Redemption Provisions and Change of Control Purchase Right The Company may, at its option, redeem or purchase, in whole or in part, the 2029 Notes and the 2032 Notes at any time prior to February&#160;15, 2029 (two months prior to maturity) and January&#160;15, 2032 (three months prior to maturity), respectively, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes being redeemed, plus a corresponding &#8220;make-whole&#8221; premium as set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, the Company may, at its option, redeem or purchase, in whole or in part, the 2029 Notes and the 2032 Notes on or after February&#160;15, 2029 (two months prior to maturity) and January&#160;15, 2032 (three months prior to maturity), respectively, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In the event that certain changes in the tax law of any relevant jurisdiction would impose withholding taxes on payments on the Notes, the Company may redeem a series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, and Additional Amounts (as defined in the Indenture), if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The holders of the Notes will also have the right to require the Company to purchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, as defined in the Indenture, at an offer price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of purchase. Ranking Under the terms of the Indenture, the Notes are the Company&#8217;s senior unsecured obligations and (i)&#160;rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company&#8217;s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, (ii)&#160;rank senior in right of payment to the Company&#8217;s existing and future subordinated indebtedness, (iii)&#160;are effectively subordinated in right of payment to the Company&#8217;s existing and future secured obligations, to the extent of the assets securing such obligations and (iv)&#160;are structurally subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness or other liabilities, including trade payables, of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries. Restrictive Covenants The Indenture contains covenants that, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i)&#160;incur certain secured debt; (ii)&#160;enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and (iii)&#160;consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. Events of Default Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, which includes payment defaults, defaults in the performance of certain covenants and bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Notes may be accelerated, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would be immediately due and payable. The foregoing description of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture. A copy of the Indenture is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated by reference herein. Registration Rights Agreement On April&#160;14, 2022, the Company and BofA Securities, Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers of the Notes, entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Notes (the &#8220;Registration Rights Agreement&#8221;). The Company agreed under the Registration Rights Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)&#160;file a registration statement on an appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of the Notes for new notes, with terms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of Notes and (ii)&#160;cause the registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act. If the exchange offer is not completed on or before April&#160;14, 2027, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file and to have declared effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes and keep such shelf registration statement effective until the date that the Notes cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement). If the Company fails to satisfy this obligation with respect to a series of the Notes (a &#8220;registration default&#8221;) under the Registration Rights Agreement, then additional interest will accrue on the principal amount of the Notes of such series at an annual rate of 0.250%. The annual interest rate on such series of the Notes will increase by an additional 0.250% for each subsequent 90-day period during which the registration default continues, up to a maximum of 1.000%. The additional interest will accrue to and including the date such registration default ends, at which time the interest rate on the applicable series of Notes will revert to the original level. A registration default ends with respect to any Notes when such Notes cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities. If the Company is required to pay additional interest due to a registration default, the Company will pay such additional interest to the holders of the Notes in cash on the same dates that the Company makes other interest payments on the Notes, until the applicable registration default is cured. The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Registration Rights Agreement. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached as Exhibit&#160;4.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated by reference herein. &#160; Item&#160;8.01 Other Events.
