Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to GAAP reporting,&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;provides investors with net revenue, net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenue, and excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, debt-related costs, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on acquisition-related assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations and non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.&nbsp;Broadcom&nbsp;believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Net income attributable to NCI prior to the Redomiciliation represents approximately 5% of net income attributable to LP Units. (2) Diluted income per share includes the impact of NCI, which assumes 100% conversion of LP Units to shares of Broadcom under the "if converted" method, resulting in approximately 14 million, 22 million and 23 million LP Units included in diluted shares for the fiscal quarter ended May 6, 2018, the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended July 30, 2017, respectively. For the fiscal quarter ended August 5, 2018, there were no LP Units due to the Redomiciliation. For the three fiscal quarters ended August 5, 2018, diluted shares excluded LP units as the impact was antidilutive. &nbsp; &nbsp; BROADCOM INC.
