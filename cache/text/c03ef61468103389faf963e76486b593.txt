Substantially all employees impacted by the layoff announced in November 2022 are no longer reflected in our reported headcount as of March 31, 2023. Further, the employees that would be impacted by the 2023 layoffs are included in our reported headcount as of March 31, 2023. 1 Restructuring In 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. As of March 31, 2023 , we have substantially completed the 2022 employee layoffs while continuing to assess facilities consolidation and data center restructuring initiatives. We incurred additional pre-tax restructuring charges of $621 million in the first quarter of 2023. In March 2023, we announced three rounds of planned layoffs to further reduce our company size by approximately 10,000 employees across the Family of Apps ( FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments. In connection with these layoffs, we expect to incur total pre-tax severance and related personnel costs of approximately $1 billion, of which $523 million was recognized during the first quarter of 2023 and the remaining charges will be substantially recorded by the end of 2023. A summary of our restructuring charges for the three months ended March 31, 2023 by major activity type is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Severance and Other Personnel Costs (1) Facilities Consolidation Data Center Assets (2) Total Cost of revenue $ — $ 58 $ (168) $ (110) Research and development 320 484 — 804 Marketing and sales 3 136 — 139 General and administrative 182 129 — $ 311 Total $ 505 $ 807 $ (168) $ 1,144 ____________________________ (1) Includes severance and personnel costs of $523 million related to the 2023 layoffs and $18 million reduction in severance estimates related to the 2022 layoff. (2) Relates to a change in estimates in our data center restructuring charges recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $934 million and RL segment were $210 million during the first quarter of 2023. Excluding these charges, our operating margin would have been four p ercentage points higher and our diluted EPS would have been $0.44 higher for the first quarter of 2023. 2 CFO Outlook Commentary We expect second quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $29.5-32 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency headwinds will be less than 1% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the second quarter, based on current exchange rates. We anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $86-90 billion , updated from our prior outlook provided in March . This outlook includes $3-5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30-33 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. This outlook reflects our ongoing build out of AI capacity to support ads, Feed and Reels, along with an increased investment in capacity for our generative AI initiatives. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be around 20%. In addition, we continue to monitor ongoing regulatory developments. We expect the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to issue a decision in May in its previously disclosed inquiry relating to transatlantic data transfers of Facebook EU/ EEA user data, including a suspension order for such transfers and a fine. Our ongoing consultations with policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic continue to indicate that the proposed new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework will be fully implemented before the deadline for suspension of such transfers, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it will not be completed in time. We will also evaluate whether and to what extent the IDPC decision could otherwise impact our data processing operations even after a new data privacy framework is in force. 3 Webcast and Conference Call Inform ation Meta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

These forward- looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third- party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments (including the impact of the pending decision by the IDPC and the pending EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework); risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 . In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 26, 2023 , and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures: Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance. Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results" table in this press release. 5 META PLATFORMS, INC.
