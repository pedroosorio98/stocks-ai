At Runtime. Without Secrets. Hush Security maps NHI risks based on runtime context, automatically remediates threats, and eliminates static secrets by moving to identity-based access. Get a Demo --> --> --> --> --> --> --> --> --> --> --> --> --> Move Beyond Static Noise to Runtime Protection Runtime-Based NHI Discovery and Monitoring Hush platform delivers runtime visibility into NHI behavior. Hush correlates discovered NHIs with actual usage, identifying which workloads authenticate, how permissions are used, and where credentials are exposed. This enables prioritizing risks based on activity, and detecting dangerous patterns like shared credentials and stale identities. The platform provides complete blast radius analysis, mapping each secret to all locations and workloads using it. It continuously monitors cloud identities, supplementing incomplete logs with comprehensive usage data. Request a Live Demo Automated Remediation and Continuous Hygiene Hush leverages runtime usage to automate security operations that traditionally require manual intervention. The platform automatically revokes stale identities, right-sizes over-permissioned access, and rotates compromised credentials. This runtime-driven approach ensures remediation targets only what's genuinely unused and adjusts permissions based on real needs. The result is a significant reduction in manual security operations, enabling teams to maintain a secure baseline without breaking production systems. Request a Live Demo From Static Secrets to Identity-First Access Hush replaces static, long-lived secrets with ephemeral credentials that are automatically provisioned based on verified identity. Each workload receives dynamically generated, scoped credentials - making secrets short-lived, right-sized, and impossible to share. This transforms secret management from a security gap into an automated infrastructure that strengthens security while reducing operational overhead. Request a Live Demo Don't Take Our Word For It "Hush provides exactly the kind of control and deep visibility I need as CISO" “It takes a critical but overlooked problem off the table once and for all” Oren Gur Global VP Security, Shift 4 "Hush gave us runtime visibility we didn’t think was possible" “Hush gave us runtime visibility we didn’t think was possible. We uncovered hidden service accounts and connections that had been running under the radar for years. That level of clarity transformed how we think about identity risk.” Jacob Avidar VP R&amp;D and CISO, PlaxidityX "Secrets are the past. Policy-based, secretless access is the future" "We solved identity for people with automation and Zero Trust. Now it’s time to do the same for machines. By eliminating secrets and adopting policy-based, runtime access, we can finally secure machine identities at the scale and speed the future demands." Michael Lyborg CISO, Swimlane "With Hush, developers barely notice it’s there, but security gets stronger every day. That’s exactly the balance we needed." "Ease of use was a critical factor for us. If a tool disrupts developers, they find ways around it. With Hush, developers barely notice it’s there, but security gets stronger every day. That’s exactly the balance we needed." Gil Cohen VP of Engineering, Firefly "Managing secrets feels like fighting yesterday’s battles, constant rotations, endless overhead, and risk that never really goes away." "Moving beyond the secret-based model entirely, to a secret-less access platform where machine identities authenticate dynamically with policies, not static credentials. That’s the future: simpler, safer, built to scale and perhaps most importantly, reducing the attack surface area.” Nemi George Vice President, Information Security Officer "Protecting secrets with the same rigor as human identities is not optional; it’s essential to maintaining trust, security, and resilience across the enterprise." "As our environments become increasingly automated, non-human identities, service accounts, APIs, bots, and workloads, are now the fastest-growing attack surface. Protecting them with the same rigor as human identities is not optional; it’s essential to maintaining trust, security, and resilience across the enterprise." Raman Chakravarthy Director Information Security Unified Identity-Based Access Management Discovery with Runtime Visibility Hush Security continuously discovers every NHI, secret, and access path, across cloud, on-prem, at rest, and in runtime. With deep, real-time visibility into usage and behavior, Hush uncovers hidden attack paths before they become breaches. Find and Fix NHI Risks in One Click Hush uses runtime context to map how non-human identities, secrets, and services connect across your environment and where risk actually propagates. Hush goes beyond posture reporting with auto-remediation and prevention, so teams can reduce risk fast without operational burden. Access Without Secrets Replace long-lived secrets with just-in-time, identity-based access controls. Non-Human identities get only the access they need, when they need it, with no hardcoded secrets to steal or rotate. Securing Agentic AI Access Hush Security secures AI agentic access by replacing static secrets with identity-based, just-in-time policies. Every agent action is authenticated, scoped, and monitored in real time, ensuring no standing privileges, full visibility, and dynamic control based on behavior and context. See the Difference We Work Everywhere You Do Hush Security integrates with any application across clouds, on-premises, or hybrid environments using lightweight eBPF and API-based connectors.
