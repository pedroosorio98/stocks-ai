Basis of Presentation Avago's financial results include results from LSI Corporation's ("LSI") continuing operations starting the third fiscal quarter of 2014, from PLX Technology Inc. starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014, and from Emulex Corporation ("Emulex") starting the third fiscal quarter of 2015, in each case from the date of their acquisition. The financial results from businesses that have been classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements are not included in the results presented below, unless otherwise stated. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 GAAP Results Net revenue was $1,735 million , an increase of 7 percent from $1,614 million in the previous quarter and an increase of 37 percent from $1,269 million in the same quarter last year. Gross margin was $884 million , or 51 percent of net revenue. This compares with gross margin of $846 million , or 52 percent of net revenue last quarter, and gross margin of $393 million , or 31 percent of net revenue in the same quarter last year. Operating expenses were $585 million . This compares with $428 million in the prior quarter and $555 million for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $299 million , or 17 percent of net revenue. This compares with operating income of $418 million , or 26 percent of net revenue, in the prior quarter, and a loss of $162 million , or 13 percent of net revenue, in the same quarter last year. Net income, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $240 million , or $0.84 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $344 million , or $1.21 per diluted share, for the prior quarter, and a net loss of $164 million , or $0.65 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. The Company's cash balance at the end of the third fiscal quarter was $1.4 billion , compared to $2.5 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The Company generated $592 million in cash from operations and spent $148 million on capital expenditures in the third fiscal quarter of 2015. Within the quarter, the closing of the Company's acquisition of Emulex resulted in the payment of $582 million in cash to acquire all of Emulex's outstanding shares. As a result of the acquisition, all of the $175 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of Emulex's 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Emulex Notes") became convertible at an increased conversion rate, until June 30, 2015 , under the make-whole fundamental change provision of the indenture relating to the Emulex Notes. As a result of the acquisition, upon conversion, holders of Emulex Notes were only entitled to receive a cash payment based on the $8.00 per share acquisition price. All of the outstanding Emulex Notes were converted at this increased conversion rate, resulting in an aggregate cash payout of $178 million in the third quarter. The Company previously issued $1 billion of its 2% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 (the "Convertible Notes") to two investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners . During the third quarter, the noteholders converted all of the Convertible Notes. The settlement of the conversion resulted in an aggregate cash payment of $1 billion , and the issuance of an aggregate of approximately 13.8 million shares of the Company to the noteholders within the quarter. On June 30, 2015 , the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per ordinary share, totaling $104 million .
