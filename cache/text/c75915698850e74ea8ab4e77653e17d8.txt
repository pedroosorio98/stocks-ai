Alphabet Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) has received notice of an unsolicited mini-tender offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation of Ontario, Canada to purchase up to 1 million shares of Alphabet&#8217;s Class C capital stock at a price of $138.90 per share in cash. TRC Capital Investment&#8217;s offer price of $138.90 per share is approximately 4.48 percent lower than the $145.41 closing share price of Alphabet&#8217;s Class C capital stock on February 6, 2024 &#8211; the business day prior to the date of the offer. This offer to purchase up to 1 million shares by TRC Capital Investment represents less than 0.02 percent of the shares of Alphabet&#8217;s Class C capital stock outstanding as of the February 7, 2024 offer date. On February 8, 2024, the Company issued the release attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.1, informing its stockholders that the Company does not endorse TRC Capital&#8217;s unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommending that stockholders do not tender their shares.

The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2024, but TRC Capital may extend the offer period at its discretion.
