INVESTMENT BANK (IB) Operating Results for IB 3Q05 4Q04 ($ millions) 4Q05 3Q05 4Q04 $ O/(U) % O/(U) $ O/(U) % O/(U) Net Revenue $3,187 $4,461 $3,201 ($1,274) (29%) ($14) -% Provision for Credit Losses (83) (46) (173) (37) (80) 90 52 Noninterest Expense 2,161 2,875 2,390 (714) (25) (229) (10) Operating Earnings $664 $1,063 $660 ($399) (38%) $4 1% Discussion of Results: Operating earnings of $664 million were essentially flat from the prior year and down 38% from the prior quarter. Compared with the p rior year , results reflected flat revenues , while lower compensation expense was offset by a reduced benefit from the provision for credit losses. The decrease in earnings versus the prior qua rter was related primarily to lower trading results compared with a record third quarter , partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense and higher investment banking fees. Net revenue of $ 3.2 billion was flat compared with the prior year and down 29% from the prior quarter. Investment banking fees were strong at $1.2 billion, up 8% from the prior year and 18% from the prior quarter and were the highest since the first quarter of 2000. Advisory fees of $341 million were up 36% from last year, with strong performance in the Americas and E urope. Debt underwriting fees of $ 509 million were down 18% from last year , largely due to lower loan syndication fees. Equity underwriting fees of $31 1 million were up 46% from the prior year, driven by strength in Asia and E urope. Both advisory and equity underwriting performance benefited from the Cazenove joint venture that closed in the first quarter of 2005. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $1.1 billion was down 28%, or $426 million versus last year, and down 55% from a record third quarter due to weak trading results, primarily from poor positioning in U.S. interest rate and commodities markets. Equity Markets revenue of $ 458 million increased by $215 million, or 88%, reflecting im proved trading compared with the prior year, as well as stronger commissions. Compared with the prior quarter, E quity Markets revenue was down 36%, primarily due to lower trading revenue. Credit portfolio revenues of $4 64 million were up by $116 million, or 33% from the prior year, reflecting increased trading revenues from hedging activities. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $ 83 million, compared with a benefit of $1 73 million in the prior year and a $ 46 million benefit in the prior quarter. The benefit reflects the continued strong quality of the credit portfolio. Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, down by $229 million, or 10%, from the prior year and down by $714 million, or 25%, from the prior quarter. Declines for both periods were driven primarily by lower incentive compensation. In addition, expenses in the current quarter increased due to the joint venture with Cazenove. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings of $803 million were up by $28 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The increase reflected improved MSR risk management results and lower expenses due to merger - related expense savings and other efficiencies. These be nefits were offset partially by a $120 million net loss associated with a transfer of $3.3 billion of adjustable rate mortgage loans to held-for-sale and a prior -year net benefit related to the sale of the manufactured home loan portfolio. Additionally, narrower spreads on loans and deposits offset the benefit of growth in these balances. Net revenue of $3.6 billion was up by $49 million , or 1%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.5 billion declined by $1 70 million, or 6%. The decline was re lated to the sale of loan portfolios * in late 2004 and early 2005 and spread compression on loans and deposits. These decreases were offset partially by higher home equity and deposit balances. Noninterest revenue of $1.1 billion was up by $219 million, or 25%. The improvement was largely driven by an increase of $236 million in MSR risk management revenue to $49 million and higher automobile operating lease income, offset in part by the loss on the transfer of mortgage loans to held-for-sale. The provision for credit losses was $15 8 million, up by $80 million from the prior year. Prior - year results included a release of the allowance for loan losses related to the sale of the manufactured home loan portfolio. Excluding this release, the provision was flat to the prior year. Results continue to reflect lower net charge -offs, good credit quality trends across all business segments and the benefit of certain portfolios in run-off. * Includes $5.2 billion of adjustable rate mortgage loans, $4.0 billion of manufactured home loans, $3.8 billion of automobile loans and $2.0 billion of recreational vehicle loans. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, down by $74 million, or 3%, from t he prior year. The reduction reflected operating efficiencies in nearly all businesses, partially offset by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases, and ongoing investments in retail banking distribution and sales. Home Finance operating earnings were $267 million, up by $28 million from the prior year. Operating earnings for the Prime Production & Servicing segment totaled $ 61 million, up by $117 million. The improved performance was primarily the result of an in crease of $236 million in MSR risk management revenue to $49 million , increased servicing revenue and lower expenses. Improvement in MSR risk management results was due in part to the absence of prior -year securities losses on hedge repositioning. Operating earnings for the Consumer Real Est ate Lending segment totaled $ 206 million, down by $89 million. Prior -year results included a $95 million net pre -tax benefit associated with the sale of a $4.0 billion manufactured home loan portfolio and a $52 mil lion pre -tax charge related to a transfer of adjustable rate mortgage loans to held -for-sale. Excluding these items and the current period loss associated with the transfer of $3.3 billion of mortgage loans to held -for-sale, earnings were up $12 million. This increase reflected higher loan balances and lower expenses offset partially by loan spread compression due to rising short -term interest rates and a flat yield curve, which contributed to accelerated home equity loan payoffs. Other Highlights Include: § Mortgage loan originations of $31.9 billion were down 2% compared with the prior year and down 19% from the prior quarter. § Home equity loan originations of $12.1 billion were up 1% from the prior year and down 15% from the prior quarter. § Third-party mortgage loans serviced were $468 billion, an increase of $36.6 billion, or 8%. § Average mortgage loans retained were $46.6 billion, an increase of 4%; period-end mortgage loans were $43.0 billion. § Average home equity loans retained were $ 73.0 billion , an i ncrease of 4%; period-end home equity loans were $76.8 billion. § Nonperforming assets of $998 million increased by $154 million, or 18%. § Net charge -off rate was 0. 12%, down from 0.17%, excluding charge -offs associated with the sold manufactured home portfolio. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Consumer & Small Business Banking operating earnings were $414 million, down $16 million from the prior year. The lower results reflected narrower spreads on deposit balances and lower investment sales revenue. Providing a partial offset we re higher deposit balances and increased debit card fees. Noninterest expense remained flat, with merger savings and other efficiencies offsetting continued investments in retail banking distribution and sales. Other Highlights Include: § Checking accounts grew by 91,000 to 8.8 million during the quarter. § Branch sales of credit cards increased 47% from the prior year. § Branch sales of mortgage loans increased 107% from the prior year. § Number of branches increased to 2,641, up 133 from the prior year and up 92 from the prior quarter. § Overhead ratio of 66% was up from 65% in the prior year. Auto & Education Finance operating earnings were $87 million, up by $3 million from the prior year. Prior-year results included a reduction in the allowance for loan losses of $35 million attributable to favorable credit trends and a $25 million charge to cover higher than expected lease residual losses. Excluding these items, lower loan and lease balances offset the benefit of lower credit costs, higher education loan sales and wider loan spreads. After adjusting for the impact of increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases, expenses declined , reflecting ongoing efforts to align costs with reduced production volumes. Other Highlights Include: § Announced agreement to acquire Collegiate Funding Services, Inc., a leader in student loan servicing and consolidation. § Average loan receivables were $4 5.3 billion, down by $8.9 billion, or 1 6%, from the prior year and down by $600 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter. § Average lease-related assets were $5.5 billion, down by $2.9 billion, or 35%, from the prior year and down by $700 million, or 11%, from the prior quarter. § The net charge-off rate increased slightly to 0.66% from 0.65%. Insurance operating earnings were $35 million, up by $13 million from the prior year on net revenue of $16 4 million. The increase was due primarily to lower expenses and increased net interest spread earned on proprietary annuity activity, partially offset by increased proprietary annuity sales commissions. Other Highlights Include: § Gross insurance-related revenue was $413 million, down by $8 million, or 2%. § Proprietary annuity sales were $154 million, up from $35 million. § Term life premiums were $126 million, up 6%.

There is no impact to operating earnings. (b) 3Q05 provision included $100 million related to Hurricane Katrina. Discussion of Results: Operating earnings of $30 2 million were down by $213 million, or 41%, from the prior year. The lower results for the quarter reflected approximately $650 million in pre -tax net loan losses and reversals of revenue related to increased bankruptcies . Partially offsetting the impact of increased bankruptcies were lower expenses driven by merger savings, stronger underlying credit quality and higher revenue from increased loan balances and sales volume. Net revenue was $3.7 billion, down by $109 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Paymentech, revenue was up 2%. Net interest income was $2.9 billion, down by $63 million, or 2%, due to narrower loan spreads and the reversal of approximately $75 million of revenue related to increased bankruptcies. Partially offsetting this reduction were increase d loan balances , due in part to the acquisition of the Sears Canada portfolio. Noninterest revenue of $87 1 million was down by $46 million, or 5%. Adjusting for the impact of the deconsolidation of Paymentech , noninterest revenue was up 13% due to higher charge volume resulting in increased interchange income, partially offset by higher volume - driven payments to partners and higher expense related to reward programs. The provision for credit losses and total managed net charge -offs were $2.2 billion, up by $501 million, or 29% from the prior year . This increase was d ue to higher bankruptcy -related net charge-offs, which are estimated to have been $575 million. This increase was offset partially by higher recoveries and lower contractual net charge-offs. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter increased to 6.39%, up from 5.24% in the prior year and 4.70% in the prior qu arter. Adjusting for the impact of the higher bankruptcy -related net charge -offs, the managed net charge-off ratio is estimated to have been 4.75%. The 30 -day managed delinquency rate was 2.79%, down from 3.70% in the prior year and 3.39% in the prior qua rter. Th ese reduction s were driven by higher bankruptcy-related net charge-offs. Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion decreased by $265 million, or 21%. Before the impact of the deconsolidation of Paymentech , expenses were down 9%. Expenses benefited from merger savings, lower compensation expense and decreased processing cost. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Improved funding cost was largely offse t by the reduced level of the Treasury securit ies portfolio. Noninterest revenue of $1 .0 billion increased by $4 19 million due to the gain on the sale of BrownCo of $1. 3 billion, partially offset by treasury portfolio losses of $54 7 million and lower private equity gains. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 11 Noninterest expense was $7 30 million, up $ 270 million, or 59%, from the prior year. The expense increase was due to the cost of the accelerated vesting of stock options of $145 million and higher other expense. These increases were partially offset by merger -related savings and other efficiencies. Other Highlights Include: § In the fourth quarter of 2005, the firm repatriat ed foreign earnings u nder the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 , resulting in a net tax benefit of $55 million. § Private Equity portfolio was $6.2 billion, down from $7.5 billion in the prior year and up from $5.9 billion in the prior quarter.

Discussion of Results: Operating earnings were $2. 6 billion, up by $301 million, or 13%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher revenue and lower expenses, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses. Net re venue was $1 5.0 billion, up by $806 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $8.4 billion was up by $852 million, or 11%, primarily due to the gain on the sale of BrownCo; higher asset management, administration and commissions revenues ; improved MSR risk management resul ts; and higher investment banking fees . Partially offsetting this growth were securities losses on the treasury portfolio, lower private equity gains, lower trading revenue and the deconsolidation of Paymentech . Net interest income was $6. 6 billion, down by $46 million, or 1%, due to narrower spreads on consumer loans and deposits as well as wholesale loans. These declines were offset partially by higher consumer loan balances; wider spreads and higher volumes related to wholesale liability balances; and higher consumer deposits. The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, up by $643 million, or 39%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $108 million for the quarter, compared with a benefit of $170 million in the prior year, reflecting continued strength in credit quality. The wholesale loan net charge-off rate wa s 0.07% for the quarter , an improvement from a net charge-off rate of 0. 21% in the prior year. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $2.4 billion, $581 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher bankruptcy-related net charge-offs in Card Services and the release, in the fourth quarter of 2004, of the allowance for loan losses related to the sale of the manufac tured home loan portfolio in Retail Financial Services. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $ 2.6 billion at December 31, 2005, down $641 million, or 20%, from the prior-year level of $3.2 billion. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 Noninterest e xpense w as $ 8.7 billion, down $ 197 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Noncompensation expenses decreased in most categories , reflecting the deconsolidation of Paymentech, merger-related savings and other efficiencies . Compensation expense increased due to the accelerated vesting of stock options. Other Highlights Include: § Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.5% at December 31 , 2005 (estimated), 8.2% at September 30, 2005, and 8.7% at December 31, 2004. § During the quarter, $ 1.0 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 26.3 million shares purchased at an average price of $ 38.05 per share. As of December 31, 2005, a total of $ 4.1 billion, or 112.8 million shares, have been purchased under the $6.0 billion share purchase program. § Headcount of 168,847 decreased by 108 since September 30, 2005. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Merger and other financial information • Merger savings and cost : For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, approximately $ 550 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualized rate of $2.2 billion. Management continues to estimate annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion. Management estimates that annualized merger savings will be $2.8 billion by the end of 2006. Merger expenses of $77 million were expensed during the fourth quarter of 2005, bringing the total amoun t expensed year- to-date to $ 722 million and $ 2.1 billion cumulative since the merger announcement. Management continues to estimate remaining merger costs of $ 900 million to $1.4 billion, which are expected to be expensed over the next two years. • On December 13, 2005, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of the firm approved the acceleration of the vesting of all options that had been granted to the firm's employees, including its executive officers, under the firm's Growth and Performance Incentive Program (GPIP), adopted on January 18, 2001. Absent the acceleration of the vesting to the close of business on December 30, 2005, these options would have become vested on January 18, 2007. Options to purchase approx imately 40.6 million shares (of which options to purchase approximately 3.1 million shares are held by the firm's executive officers) were outstanding as of the close of business on December 30, 2005. The exercise price of the options subject to acceleration is $51.22 and the closing price for the firm's stock on December 30, 2005, the day the vesting became effective , was $39.69. The expense associated with the acceleration of the vesting of the options was approximately $145 million, which expense has bee n reflected in the firm's fourth quarter financial results, rather than in a pro forma footnote disclosure, as previously announced. The firm had previously adopted, effective January 1, 2003, FASB Statement No. 123 (“Accounting for Stock -Based Compensation”). Accordingly, since January 1, 2003, the firm has been recognizing in its income statements the expense of all options granted since that date. As a result of its adoption of SFAS 123 and the acceleration of the vesting of the GPIP options , as of December 31, 2005, the firm has approximately 23 million options outstanding that had been granted prior to January 1, 2003, the cost of which has not yet been expensed. The expense of these options, which is estimated to be $55 million, will begin to be re cognized in the firm’s income statements in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the firm’s adoption as of January 1, 2006 of FASB Statement No. 123R (“Share-Based Payment”). JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, man agement analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business results on an operating basis, which is a non -GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results. Operating basis excludes: (i) merger costs, ( ii) the non -operating litigation charges taken in the first and second quarters of 2005 and second quarter of 2004 and the non -operating insurance recovery taken in the fourth quarter of 2005 in respect of certain of the firm’s material litigation; and (iii) costs related to the conformance of certain accounting policies as a result of the merger . M anagement believes these items are not part of the firm’s normal daily business operations and, therefore, not indicative of trends, as they do not provide mean ingful comparisons with other periods. In addition, the firm manages its lines of business on an operating basis. In the case of the Investment Bank, noninterest revenue on an operating basis includes in trading revenue net interest income related to tra ding activities. Trading activities generate revenues, which are recorded for U.S. GAAP purposes in two line items on the income statement: trading revenue, which includes the mark -to-market gains or losses on trading positions; and net interest income, w hich includes the interest income or expense related to those positions. Combining both the trading revenue and related net interest income enables management to evaluate the Investment Bank’s trading activities, by considering all revenue related to thes e activities, and facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. In the case of Card Services, operating, or managed, basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge -offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will affect both the loan receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed loan receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge -off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Commencing with the first quarter of 2005, operating revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest i ncome) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax -equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax - exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the operating results on a basis comparable to taxable securitie s and investments. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. The Corporate sector’s and the firm’s operating revenue and income tax expense for the periods prior to the first quarter of 2005 have been restated to be similarly presented on a tax -equivalent basis. This restatement had no impact on the Corporate sector’s or the firm’s opera ting earnings. See page 7 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (fourth quarter 2005) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to operating basis. 2. Pre-tax margin represents operating earnings before income taxes divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre -tax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is , therefore , another basis by which management evaluates TSS’ and AWM’s performance and that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
