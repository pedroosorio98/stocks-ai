2025 Proxy Supplement April 2025 Executive Summary Board Composition & Succession Planning A  We recommend voting FOR all Board Director nominees  We recommend voting AGAINST the Independent Chair shareholder proposal  The Board believes it is in the best position to determine the appropriate structure of its leadership at any given time  Outstanding long-term performance does not happen without exceptional leadership. Under the current leadership structure, the Firm continues to grow its business, improve its products and services and lift up communities Executive CompensationB  We recommend voting FOR the management proposal on executive compensation Human RightsC  We recommend voting AGAINST the social impacts of transition finance shareholder proposal  There is no universally accepted definition of “transition finance” in the market. As such, the utility of this disclosure to investors is unclear  The social factors referenced by the proponent are generally not driven by unique environmental attributes 2  The Firm enhanced and implemented appropriate policies and practices that address the former proponent’s Indigenous Peoples’ rights concerns, leading to a proposal withdrawal Board Independence & Shareholder Responsiveness  Under the current leadership structure, the Board has demonstrated a track record of responsiveness to shareholder feedback D We execute a robust, ongoing shareholder engagement program to gather valuable feedback to share with senior management and our Board Ongoing discussions with shareholders to consider their perspectives on our practices  In 2024, we solicited feedback through approximately 255 engagements with 195 shareholders and other stakeholders that represented ~52% of the Firm's outstanding common stock  We provided updates on topics of interest, including Board and management succession planning; executive compensation; our approach to the regulatory environment; our risk management approach to cybersecurity, AI, geopolitics and the macroeconomic landscape; and the Firm’s sustainability efforts, including its disclosure of an Energy Supply Financing Ratio  We also discussed the Firm’s strategy and its financial and operating performance ~52% Engagement with shareholders2 ~73% Institutional investors1 in shareholder base ~20% Lead Independent Director participation in engagements2 ENGAGEMENT METRICS (% CUMULATIVE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING) Executive Summary For additional information and endnotes, please see slide 15 3 We recommend shareholders vote FOR management proposals and AGAINST shareholder proposals at the 2025 Annual Meeting Proposal number Proposal title Management recommendation Rationale 1 Election of directors FOR The Board nominees possess the skills, experience, personal attributes and tenure needed to guide the Firm’s strategy and to effectively oversee the Firm’s risk management and internal control frameworks and management’s execution of its responsibilities 2 Advisory resolution to approve executive compensation FOR For 2024 pay decisions, the Compensation & Management Development Committee (“CMDC”) recognized the Firm’s continued focus on serving its clients and customers amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, while investing in and executing on long-term strategic initiatives. The Firm experienced growth across all of its market-leading lines of business, achieved record financial results and maintained a fortress balance sheet 3 Ratification of independent registered public accounting firm FOR The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that continued retention of the auditor as the Firm’s independent external auditor is in the best interests of JPMorganChase and its shareholders 4 Independent board chairman AGAINST The proposal calls for a mandatory, enduring and inflexible policy on leadership structure but presents absolutely no evidence that a policy to maintain a separate CEO and Chair leadership structure serves the best interests of the Firm and its shareholders. Under the current leadership structure, the Firm continues to grow its business, improve its products and services and lift up communities. This leadership structure has allowed for effective execution on strategic priorities 5 Report on social impacts of transition finance AGAINST The Proponent references social factors that are generally not driven by unique environmental attributes. Instead, actions to address climate change are often one influence among many in social factors that are more appropriately addressed through public policy. Applying an artificially narrow focus to our assessment of environmental and social (“E&S”) matters would limit our ability to understand and address the social factors that are relevant to our business Executive Summary 4 Board nominees bring leadership experience and skills aligned with the Firm’s business and strategy, with a well-balanced mix of tenure Composition of Board Nominees 92% Independent 50% Women 5 3 4 1-4 years 5-8 years 9+ years Stephen Burke, 66 Tenure: 21 LID, CMDC*, CGNC Linda Bammann, 69 Tenure: 12 RC*, CMDC Todd Combs, 54 Tenure: 9 CGNC*, CMDC Alicia Boler Davis, 55 Tenure: 3 RC James Dimon, 69 Tenure: 21 Chairman Alex Gorsky, 64 Tenure: 3 AC, PRC Mellody Hobson, 56 Tenure: 7 PRC*, RC Phebe Novakovic, 67 Tenure: 5 AC, PRC Virginia Rometty, 67 Tenure: 5 CMDC, CGNC Meet Our Board Nominees A Committee Legend LID Lead Independent Director CMDC Compensation & Management Development Committee CGNC Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee AC Audit Committee RC Risk Committee PRC Public Responsibility Committee *indicates Chair of Committee WELL-BALANCED TENURES The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR our Board nominees (Proposal 1) Board Composition & Succession Planning – Proposal 1: Election of Directors 5 Mark Weinberger, 63 Tenure: 2 AC* Michele Buck, 63 Tenure: 1 AC Brad Smith, 61 Tenure: 1 RC The Board has elected Brad D.

All candidates recommended to the Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards OUR ONGOING RECRUITMENT AND RENEWAL PROCESS Board Composition & Succession Planning – Proposal 1: Election of Directors The Board is focued on positioning the Firm for continued future success  Executive succession planning is a priority for the Board and the Firm’s senior leadership, with the objective of having a pipeline of the best executives who lead inclusively for today and the future  The Board continues to oversee management’s development of several Operating Committee (“OC”) members who are well-known to shareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr. Dimon.

Below are concerns we have with the proposal 1 2 3 4 5 The proposal presents no empirical evidence that a separate CEO / Chair leadership structure is better for shareholders than a combined CEO / Chair Further, the proposal does not acknowledge the exceptional outperformance of the company while Mr. Dimon has held both roles, and it does not recognize the key role played by an independent Lead Director and an independent Board No Empirical Evidence The Board of Directors is in the best position to determine the appropriate structure of its leadership at any given time This proposal would eliminate the Board’s ability to use its experience, judgment, boardroom insight and ongoing shareholder feedback to make the most informed decision on its own leadership structure based on current facts and circumstances Eliminates the Board’s Discretion One size does not fit all, and therefore there is no consensus about a single ideal leadership structure for all companies There is, however, a clear "market practice" among our peers; a market practice study shows the majority of the 100 largest U.S. public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have a combined CEO and Chair role and approximately 30% of the minority of those companies with separate roles do not have an independent chair One Size Does Not Fit All The proposal also makes several inaccurate statements that may mislead shareholders. It claims there are ways in which a 2021 proposal on this topic, which received 47% support, may be deemed to have received majority support. The proposal did not in fact receive majority support Proponent incorrectly asserts that our Lead Independent Director, Stephen B. Burke, is not independent and states the Board does not take this role seriously. The Lead Independent Director role includes robust responsibilities and independent authority Inaccurate Statements Contrary to its request for a mandatory, enduring, and inflexible policy on leadership structure, the proposal actually supports Board judgment by providing for the Board’s discretion in appointing a non- independent “Temporary Chairman” while it seeks an independent Chair It is unclear what the proponent intends in suggesting that the Board appoint a “Temporary Chairman” – this is not a standard corporate governance practice and would undermine the authority of the role of the Chair A “Temporary Chairman” is Not a Standard Practice 8 Proposal 4 undermines the Board’s ability to use its experience, judgment and boardroom insight to make the best-informed decision about leadership structure The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINSTthe Independent Chair shareholder proposal (Proposal 4) A Board Composition & Succession Planning – Proposal 4: Independent Board Chairman Outstanding long-term performance does not happen without exceptional leadership.

The Firm supports fundamental principles of human rights across all our lines of business and in each region of the world we operate C Human Rights – Proposal 5: Report on the Social Impacts of Transition Finance The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders voteAGAINST the report on social impacts of transition finance (Proposal 5) 10 The social factors referenced by the proponent are generally not driven by unique environmental attributes  Many of the issues raised by the proponent are driven by macroeconomic trends that arise from a complex set of interlocking factors  The issues are more appropriately addressed through public policy that goes beyond the role of a bank  For example, job displacement can occur for many intersecting reasons, including automation and artificial intelligence, deglobalization of supply chains, evolution of consumer demand, or changes in public policy The scope of “transition finance” is unclear  There is no universally accepted definition of “transition finance” in the market, so, it is unclear what specific activities would be included in additional disclosure and what utility it would provide to investors  Communities and labor forces around the world face a broad variety of social challenges and opportunities that cannot be analyzed in isolation We seek to take a holistic approach to assessing E&S matters  Applying a narrow lens focused on “transition finance” may prevent a more comprehensive understanding of broader social challenges and opportunities  For example, an understanding of labor dynamics would be incomplete if it focused only transition finance and excluded other factors Human rights considerations are embedded in the Firm’s risk management process  Assessing our clients’ approaches to, and performances on, E&S matters is an important component of risk management at JPMorganChase  Failing to appropriately manage E&S risks can impact our clients’ operations and long-term economic viability, increase scrutiny from our investors, employees and regulators and affect the environment and communities across the world The Firm enhanced and implemented appropriate policies and practices that address the former proponent’s Indigenous Peoples’ rights concerns C Human Rights – 2025 Withdrawn Shareholder Proposal: Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Indicators The Firm’s response to the former 2025 shareholder proposal  In assessing issues involving Indigenous Peoples, we consider a range of internationally recognized principles, including the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards, which address the treatment of Indigenous Peoples and include the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent ("FPIC")  Although we discontinued our membership in the Equator Principles Association, we continue to be informed by the environmental a nd social objectives and risk management practices of the Equator Principles where relevant  We have internal firmwide policies and standards, including an escalation and due diligence process conducted by Nature and S ocial subject matter experts when a client’s transaction is considered to have potential material implications for Indigenous Peoples. Where risks are identified, we engage with companies and may require them to take steps to address implications for Indigenous Peoples' lands and natural resources with appropriate policies and procedures, including FPIC, before proceeding with a transaction, including general corporate purpose, asset -specific financing and capital facilitation activities  Our Human Rights Statement has been updated to reflect our approach to Indigenous Peoples' human rights concerns 11 Under the current leadership structure, the Board has demonstrated a track record of responsiveness to shareholder feedback D Board Independence & Shareholder Responsiveness EXAMPLES WHEN THE BOARD DEMONSTRATED RESPONSIVENESS TO SHAREHOLDERS’ CONCERNS For additional information and endnotes, please see slide 17 12 2016 – Amended Firm’s By-Laws to provide a right of proxy access: The Board adopted this By-Law amendment following extensive discussions with our shareholders.

Managed Revenue and ROTCE are each non-GAAP financial measures; refer to Note 1 and 2 on page 16 for a further discussion of these measures 2. Peer ROTCE, Revenue, Net Income, and CEO Compensation based on public disclosures (Form 10- K, Form 8-K, Annual Proxy Filings); Market Capitalization from S&P CapIQ database 3. Annual compensation comprises base salary, cash bonus paid and long- term incentive compensation (target value) in connection wit h the performance year, which may be different from amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table. The percentage of profits paid is equal to 3- year average annual CEO compensation divided by 3-year average net income. Excludes special awards 15 Notes 1. TCE and ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TCE and ROTCE are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. The following tables provide reconciliations and calculations of these measures for the periods presented 2. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results on a “managed” basis; theseFirmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business (a) Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE (b) Represents net income applicable to common equity / average common stockholders’ equity (c) Represents net income applicable to common equity / average TCE Average TCE, ROE, ROTCE Average for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share and ratio data) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Common stockholders’ equity$ 215,690 $ 224,631 $ 230,350 $ 229,222 $ 232,907 $ 236,865 $ 250,968 $ 253,068 $ 282,056 $ 312,370 Less: Goodwill 47,445 47,310 47,317 47,491 47,620 47,820 49,584 50,952 52,258 52,627 Less: Other intangible assets 1,092 922 832 807 789 781 876 1,112 2,572 3,042 Add: Certain deferred tax liabilities(a) 2,964 3,212 3,116 2,231 2,328 2,399 2,474 2,505 2,883 2,970 Tangible common equity $170,117 $179,611 $185,317 $183,155 $186,826 $190,663 $ 202,982 $ 203,509 230,109 259,671 Net income applicable to common equity $ 22,927 $ 23,086 $ 22,778 $ 30,923 $ 34,844 $ 27,548 $ 46,734 $ 36,081 $ 48,051 $ 57,212 Return on common equity(b) 11 % 10 % 10 % 13 % 15 % 12 % 19 % 14 % 17 % 18 % Return on tangible common equity(c) 13 13 12 17 19 14 23 18 21 22 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Managed basis Total net revenue (in millions) For the year ended December 31, 2024 Reported Total net revenue $ 177,556 Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment (a) 3,037 Managed basis Total net revenue $ 180,593 (a) Predominantly recognized in CIB and Corporate 16 Forward-looking statements This Proxy Supplemental Presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
