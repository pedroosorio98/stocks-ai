Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 8 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of March 26, 2022 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 97,603 Due after 5 years through 10 years 22,899 Due after 10 years 20,717 Total fair value $ 141,219 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 26, 2022, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 20 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Quarterly Highlights Total net sales increased 9% or $7.7 billion during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company released the following products: • iPhone SE® with 5G technology; • iPad Air®, powered by the Apple M1 chip; • All-new Mac Studio™, powered by the Apple M1 Max or the new Apple M1 Ultra chip; and • All-new Apple Studio Display™ . The Company repurchased $22.9 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion during the second quarter of 2022. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 14 COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock. During the second quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and many of the Company’s retail stores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. Substantially all of the Company’s other facilities are open, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees. The Company continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. At times, certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that could affect sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 18 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 March 26, 2022 March 27, 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 5,129 $ 4,381 $ 11,740 $ 9,205 Effective tax rate 17.0% 15.6% 16.4% 14.9% Statutory federal income tax rate 21% 21% 21% 21% The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022 (the “Regulations”). The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of the Regulations, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of the Regulations and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities , along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of March 26, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $40.6 billion, with $40.5 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). As of March 26, 2022 , the remaining availability under the Program was $17.6 billion. On April 28, 2022, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the Program authorization by $90 billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. On April 28, 2022, the Compan y also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2022. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 19 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of March 26, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q2 2022 Form 10-Q | 20 Item 2.
