This robust earnings generation combined with the execution of our capital strategy allowed us to exceed our CET1 target of 13% one quarter early, and we have the ability to resume stock buybacks this quarter, as we deem appropriate. Looking further ahead, we still await details of the Basel III finalization package, but we will manage to the new requirements as we have demonstrated in the past.” Dimon continued: “Our lines of business performed well in the quarter, and we continued to see momentum in our areas of strategic focus. In Consumer & Community Banking, debit and credit card sales were up 9%, while card loans were up 19% with total revolving balances now back to pre-pandemic levels. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Markets revenue rose 7% as client activity remained strong in Fixed Income. Global Investment Banking fees were down significantly in a challenging environment, although we maintained our #1 ranking in 2022. Commercial Banking loans were up 14% on new loan originations and higher revolver utilization. And in Asset & Wealth Management, revenue increased 3% as higher net interest income more than offset the impact of lower market levels.” Dimon added: “The U.S. economy currently remains strong with consumers still spending excess cash and businesses healthy. However, we still do not know the ultimate effect of the headwinds coming from geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation that is eroding purchasing power and has pushed interest rates higher, and the unprecedented quantitative tightening. We remain vigilant and are prepared for whatever happens, so we can serve our customers, clients and communities around the world across a broad range of economic environments.” Dimon concluded: “As a result of the investments we have made over the years and our dedication to clients, the Firm is in a position of strength as the market leader in U.S. retail deposits, credit cards, business banking, Payments, Markets, investment banking and multifamily lending as some examples. But we will not rest here, and we remain committed to investing in the franchise and innovating. The importance of these investments and investing through cycles was particularly evident this year, as we generated a robust ROTCE of 18% even after sharply accelerating our investments in the business. In 2022, we extended credit and raised $2.4 trillion in capital for small and large businesses, governments and U.S. consumers. Finally, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our employees and how they work to support our customers and communities and earn their trust every single day.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 4Q22 results included: n $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares in Corporate ($0.23 increase in earnings per share) n $874 million net investment securities losses in Corporate ($0.22 decrease in earnings per share) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.0 billion, or $1 per share n Net payout LTM 7,8 of 37% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $90.29, up 3%; tangible book value per share 1 of $73.12, up 2% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 2 of $219 billion and Standardized ratio2 of 13.2%; Advanced ratio2 of 13.5% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.6% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 4Q22 expense of $19.0 billion; reported overhead ratio of 55%; managed overhead ratio1 of 53% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $2.4 trillion of credit and capital9 raised in 2022 n $250 billion of credit for consumers n $33 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $1.1 trillion of credit for corporations n $1.0 trillion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $65 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Noninterest revenue was $15.3 billion, down 8%, largely driven by lower Investment Banking fees, management and performance fees in AWM, operating lease income in Auto and net production revenue in Home Lending, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue. Noninterest expense was $19.0 billion , up 6%, driven by higher structural expense, primarily compensation, and continued investments in the business, including technology and marketing, partially offset by lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion, reflecting a net reserve build of $1.4 billion and net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build in the current quarter included $1.0 billion in Consumer and $343 million in Wholesale, driven by a modest deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, now reflecting a mild recession in the central case, as well as loan growth in Card Services, partially offset by a reduction in uncertainty as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. Net charge-offs of $887 million were up $337 million, largely driven by Card Services. The prior year net benefit of $1.3 billion reflected a reserve release of $1.8 billion and $550 million of net charge-offs. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Card Services & Auto net revenue was $5.6 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher Card Services net interest income on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto operating lease income. Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, up 3%, driven by higher investments in the business and structural expense, including compensation, technology, travel services and marketing, largely offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense, primarily auto lease depreciation. The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, reflecting a $1.0 billion reserve build and net charge-offs of $845 million.

Net charge-offs of $845 million were up $330 million, largely driven by Card Services. The prior year net benefit was driven by a $1.6 billion reserve release primarily in Card Services.

News Release 5 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $90.29, $87.00 and $88.07 at December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2021 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 2. Estimated.
