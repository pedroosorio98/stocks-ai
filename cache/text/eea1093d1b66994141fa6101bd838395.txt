This is our best ever first quarter performance. &nbsp; &nbsp; Production Deliveries Subject to lease accounting Model S/X 15,390 12,200 16% Model 3/Y 87,282 76,200 5% Total 102,672 88,400 7% &nbsp; Model Y production started in January and deliveries began in March, significantly ahead of schedule. Additionally, our Shanghai factory continued to achieve record levels of production, despite significant setbacks. Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q1 earnings. Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange movements and mix of directly leased vehicles. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Footer Tesla © 2026 Subscription Preferences Contact &amp; FAQ Privacy &amp; Legal
