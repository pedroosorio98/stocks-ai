CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA&rsquo;s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com . Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA&rsquo;s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA&rsquo;s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA&rsquo;s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA&rsquo;s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user&rsquo;s overall understanding of the company&rsquo;s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company&rsquo;s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company&rsquo;s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company&rsquo;s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. &nbsp;
