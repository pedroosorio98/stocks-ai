New York, July 20, 2005 – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported 200 5 second-quarter net income of $1.0 billion, or $0.28 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.5 billion, or $0.27 per share, for the second quarter of 2004. Current period results include a $1.9 billion (pre -tax) litigation reserve charge, or $0.33 per sha re, and $279 million (pre -tax) of merger charges, or $0.05 per share, reflecting the merger with Bank One Corporation completed on July 1, 2004. Excluding these charges, operating earnings would have been $2.3 billion, or $0.66 per share. Prior -year reported results included a $3.7 billion (pre -tax) litigation reserve charge, or $1.09 per share, and $90 million (pre -tax) of merger charges, or $0.03 per share, but do not include Bank One’s results.

Refer to the “Merger and other financial information” section of this press release for additional information concerning the merger. William B. Harrison, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "As we annou nced last month, trading performance for the second quarter was very weak. Our other major businesses, however, reported good results, with Card Services, Treasury & Securit ies Services and Asset & Wealth Management posting double -or triple -digit earnings growth, and Investment Banking fees remaining strong." Commenting on the Enron litigation settlement and increased legal reserves, Mr. Harrison said, "Our resolution of the Enron class-action lawsuit substantially reduces our risk related to this matter. Given the current legal environment, litigation reserves were increased by $1.9 billion. We believe that with this action the firm’s litigation reserves are adequate to meet its remaining litigation exposure." James Dimon, President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "In our first full year as a combined firm, we have made significant progress in all of our businesses -- both in terms of integrating the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase franchises and in executing our growth strategy. In the coming quarter w e will execute the Texas market conversion and complete the platform conversion in Card Services. These conversions are among many projects underway to make our firm more efficient and drive improved profitability. During the second quarter, we launched a national advertising campaign that introduced a modernized Chase brand , and we began converting hundreds of Bank One branches and millions of Bank One credit cards to the Chase name.” JPMorgan Chase & Co.

INVESTMENT BANK (IB) Operating Results – IB 2Q04 h-JPMC 2Q04 Proforma ($ millions) 2Q05 $ O/(U) % O/(U) $ O/(U) % O/(U) Net Revenues $2,750 ($189) (6%) ($647) (19%) Provision for Credit Losses (343) (215) (168) (28) (9) Noninterest Expenses 2,178 122 6 3 - Operating Earnings $606 ($38) (6%) ($410) (40%) Discussion of Historical Results: Operating earnings were $606 million, down $38 million, or 6%, from the prior year. The lower performance was due to decrea sed trading revenues, partially offset by the merger. Trading revenues for the quarter were $614 million, down $622 million, or 50%, from the prior year. The disappointing trading performance reflected a challenging market environment. This resulted in weak portfolio management results, lower proprietary trading revenues due to fewer market opportunities and reduced client flows. In addition, there were specific losses that affected equity trading results. Trading revenues were generally weaker in Euro pe than in the United States and Asia. Partially offsetting the weak trading results were strong investment banking fees and continued improvement in credit quality. Total revenues of $2.8 billion were down $189 million, or 6%, compared to the prior year . Investment banking fees of $965 million remained strong, increasing $74 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year. Advisory revenues of $359 million were up 34% from the prior year and represent the highest quarter since 2000. Debt underwriting reve nues of $502 million increased 25% from the prior year driven by higher levels of loan syndication fees , while equity underwriting fees of $104 million were down 53% reflecting reduced levels of market volumes. European investment banking fees remained pa rticularly strong increasing by 33% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $1.4 billion were down $154 million, or 10% from the prior year. The decline was driven by weaker trading performance in credit and interest rate markets, reflecti ng weak portfolio management results within client -related market-making activities , as well as reduced proprietary trading results , partially offset by the merger . Equity Markets revenues of $72 million decreased $89 million, or 55%, versus the prior year. The decline was due to poor portfolio management trading results, primarily related to both losses from a few concentrated client-driven positions and a write-down in trade receivables in connection with a disputed claim with a creditworthy entity. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 The overall Investment Bank trading value -at-risk increased from $65 million to $102 million since the first quarter. This increase was driven by higher levels in fixed income and equity value-at-risk measures, which were partially offset by the benefit of diversification. Credit Portfolio revenues of $295 million were down 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower trading revenues from hedging activity and lower net interest income from reduced loan balances and commitments, partially offset by the merger. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $343 million, compared to a benefit of $128 million in the prior year. The increased benefit was primarily attributable to a greater reduction in the allowance for credit losses, due to continued improvement in credit quality as a result of the change in the loan portfolio mix toward higher rated clients and net recoveries, as well as refinements in the data used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. Expenses of $2.2 billion were up $122 million, or 6%, from the prior year due to the merger and increased compensation expense. The increase in compensation expense reflected the Cazenove joint venture, net investments in technology and operations staffing , and onboarding of previously exter nally contracted staff. Partially offsetting these increases was reduced performance-based incentive compensation. Discussion of Proforma Combined Results: Operating earnings were $606 million, down $410 million, or 40%, from the prior year and 54% from the prior quarter. The declines from both periods reflect ed significantly lower trading revenues. Trading revenues for the quarter were $614 million, down $714 million, or 54% , from the prior year and 72% from the prior quarter. The disappointing tradin g performance reflected a challenging market environment. This resulted in weak portfolio management results, lower proprietary trading revenues due to fewer market opportunities and reduced client flows .

Investment banking fees of $965 million remained strong, increasing $28 million, or 3% , compared to the prior year. Advisory revenues of $359 million were up 33% from the prior year a nd represented the highest quarter since 2000. Debt underwriting revenues of $502 million increased 13% from the prior year driven by higher levels of loan syndication fees , while equity underwriting fees of $104 million were down 53% reflecting reduced l evels of market volumes. European investment banking fees remained particularly strong increasing by 32% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $1.4 billion were down $397 million, or 22% , from the prior year. The decline was driven by w eaker trading performance in credit and interest rate markets, reflecting weak portfolio management results within client -related market-making activities, as well as reduced proprietary trading results.

News Release 4 Credit Portfolio revenues of $295 million were down 35% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower trading revenues from hedging activity and lower net interest income from reduced loan balance s and commitments. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $343 million, compared to a benefit of $315 million in the prior year. The increased benefit was primarily attributable to a greater reduction in the allowance for credit losses, due to continued improvement in credit quality as a result of the change in the loan portfolio mix toward higher rated clients and net recoveries, as well as refinements in the data used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. Expenses of $2.2 billion wer e essentially flat to last year as reduced performance -based incentive compensation expense was offset by increased staff costs from higher headcount levels. Headcount of 19,269 increased by 1,474 from the prior year, primarily due to the Cazenove joint v enture, net investments in technology and operations staffing , and onboarding of previously externally contracted staff. Other Highlights Include(3): • Return on equity was 12% for the quarter and 19% for the first half of 2005. • The Investment Bank continu ed to build its franchise by maintaining a top 3 ranking in global announced M&A and improving its global equity and equity-related market share to #4 from #6. • According to Dealogic, the Investment Bank ranked #1 globally in terms of IB fees earned from advisory and stock, bond and loan underwriting for the first half of 2005. • Average loans of $51.4 billion were up $3.9 billion from the prior quarter reflecting a 4% increase in Credit Portfolio loans and higher balances related to securitization and principal investment activities. • Allowance for loan losses to average loans was 2. 90%; nonperforming assets were $946 million, down 44% from the prior year. • Announced agreement to acquire Neovest Holdings, Inc., a provider of high -performance equities trading technology and direct market access.

Discussion of Historical Results: Operating earnings were $980 million, up $584 million from the prior year. The increase was largely due to the merger, but also reflected wider spreads on deposits, increased deposit balances, growth in retained consumer real estate loans and improved MSR risk management results. These benefits were partially offset by a reduction in revenue related to lower prime mortgage originations and the decision to retain subprime mortgage loans rather than securitize. Net revenue increased to $3.8 billion, up $2.0 billion from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.6 billion increased $1.3 billion as a result of the merger, wide r spreads on deposits, increased deposit balances, as well as growth in retained consumer real estate loans. These benefits were partially offset by JPMorgan Chase & Co.

These increases were offset partially by a drop in prime mortgage originations and the absence of subprime mortgage loan securitization gains. The provision for credit losses totaled $94 million, up $16 million from last year. The increase was largely due to the merger, but also reflected higher provision expense related to the decision to retain subprime mortgage loans. These increases were partially offset by reductions in the allowance for loan losses due to lower net charge-offs and improved credit trends in most consumer lending portfolios. Expenses rose to $2.1 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the merger. Results also included ongoing investments in retail banking distribution and sales. These costs were more than offset by expense savings in nearly all businesses. Home Finance operating earnings were $413 million, up $92 million compared to the prior year. Operating earnings for the Prime Production & Servicing segment of $13 6 million were up $8 million. Results reflected improved MSR risk management results and lower expenses, offset by reduced production revenue given the drop in prime mortgage originations. Earnings for the Consumer Real Estate Lending segment of $2 77 million were up $8 4 million. Growth was largely due to the merger, but also reflected higher retained loan balances, merger -related expense savings and lower credit costs. These increases were partially offset by the absence of subprime loan securitization gains and the $4 billion manufactured home loan p ortfolio sold in late 2004. Consumer & Small Business operating earnings totaled $437 million, up $435 million from the prior year largely driven by the merger. Results also benefited from wider spreads on deposits, increased balances, and cost savings initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by continued investment in the branch distribution network. Auto & Education Finance operating earnings of $118 million were up $47 million from last year. Growth was primarily due to the merger. Resul ts reflected lower production volumes due to the competitive nature of the operating environment, and the absence of the $2 billion recreational vehicle loan portfolio sold in early 2005.

Total revenues were $13.9 billion, up $4.7 billion, or 51%, primarily due to the merger. Noninterest revenues of $7.4 billion were up $1.6 billion, or 28%, from the prior year, primarily due to the merger. Also contributing to the increase in noninterest revenues were higher asset management, administration and commissions revenues resulting from recent acquisi tions, organic business growth and improved global equity markets. Partially offsetting these increases were lower trading revenues, down $72 7 million, or 55%, from the prior year , reflecting a challenging market environment, weak portfolio management results and lower proprietary trading revenues. Net interest income was $6.5 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 92%, primarily due to the merger, higher consumer loan and deposit balances , and wider spreads on consumer deposits and wholesale liabilities, partially offset by the reduced level of the treasury portfolio and tighter wholesale loan spreads. The provision for credit losses was $ 1.5 billion, an increase of $828 million, primarily due to the merger. Total wholesale provision for credit losses was a be nefit of $218 million for the quarter compared to a benefit of $137 million in the prior year, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality and , to a lesser degree, the refinements made in the data used to estimate the allowance for credit losses. T he wholesale loan net recovery rate was 0.17 % for the quarter compared to a net charge -off rate of 0.29% in the prior year. The increase in the consumer provision from the prior year was mainly due to the merger, but also reflected increased bankruptcy lo sses from accelerated filings and higher provision expense related to the decision to retain subprime mortgage loans rather than securitize. The managed net charge - off rate for Card Services declined to 4.87% from 5.85% in the prior year. Retail Financia l Services net charge-off rate decreased to 0.25% compared to 0.29% in the prior year, primarily due to favorable loss severity for both real estate lending and vehicle finance as a result of strength in real estate and used car valuations. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.8 billion at June 30, 2005 , up 14 % from the prior year. Expenses, which exclude the non -operating litigation charges discussed below, were $8.7 billion, up $3.0 billion, or 53%, from the prior year , primarily due to the merg er. Additionally, recent acquisitions and charges to terminate a client contract were partially offset by merger -related savings and other efficiencies. The firm took a $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after -tax) non-operating litigation charge in connection w ith its settlement of the Enron class action litigation. In the second quarter of 2004 , the firm took a $3.7 billion ($2.3 billion after-tax) non-operating charge to increase litigation reserves. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 16 Discussion of Proforma Combined Results: Operating earnings were $2.3 billion, down $4 59 million, or 1 6%, from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by significantly lower revenue partially offset by lower expense and lower provision for credit losses. Total revenues were $13.9 billion, down $87 6 million, or 6%. Noninterest revenues of $7.4 billion were down $50 3 million, or 6%, from the prior year, primarily due to lower trading revenues. Trading revenues declined $82 2 million, or 5 8%, reflecting a challenging market environment, weak portfoli o management results and lower proprietary trading revenues. Noninterest revenues were also negatively affected by lower lending and deposit -related fees as a result of higher interest rates. Partially offsetting these declines were increased asset manage ment and commissions revenues related to the recent acquisitions, organic business growth, and improved global equity markets. Net interest income was $6.5 billion, down $373 million, or 5%, primarily due to the reduced level of the treasury portfolio and tighter wholesale loan spreads, partially offset by higher consumer loan and deposit balances and wider spreads on consumer deposits and wholesale liabilities. The provision for credit l osses was $1.5 billion, down $89 million, or 6%. Total wholesale pro vision for credit losses was a benefit of $218 million for the quarter compared to a benefit of $326 million in the prior year , reflecting continued improvement in credit quality and , to a lesser degree, the refinements made in the data used to estimate th e allowance for credit losses. The wholesale loan net recovery rate was 0.17% for the quarter compared to a net charge -off rate of 0.13% in the prior year. Total consumer managed provision for credit losses decreased to $1.7 billion, down 10%, reflecting lower net charge-offs and positive delinquency trends. Partially offsetting the reduction was increased bankruptcy losses from accelerated filings. The managed net charge -off rate for Card Services declined to 4.87% from 5.56% in the prior year. Retail Financial Services net charge -off rate was 0.25% compared to 0.40% in the prior year. The improvement compared to the prior year reflected favorable loss severity for both real estate lending and vehicle finance as a result of strength in real estate and used car valuations. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.8 billion at June 30, 2005, down 30% from the prior year’s level of $4.1 billion. Expenses, which exclude the non -operating litigation charges discussed below, were $8.7 billion, down $91 million, or 1%, from the prior year, driven primarily by merger-related savings and other efficiencies. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher expenses related to recent acquisitions and charge s to terminate a client contract. The firm took a $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after -tax) non-operating litigation charge in connection with its settlement of the Enron class action litigation. In the second quarter of 2004 , the firm took a $3.7 billion ($2.3 billion after-tax) non-operating charge to increase litigation reserves. Other Corporate Items • Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.2% at June 30, 2005 (estimated), 8.6% at March 31, 2005 and 8.6% at June 30, 2004. • During the quarter, $594 million of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 16.8 million shares at an average price of $35.32 per share. • Headcount of approximately 168,461 was up 4,080 since March 31, 2005, primarily due to business growth, technology insourcing and the acquisition of Vastera. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 17 Merger and other financial information • Merger between JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corporation: On July 1, 2004, JPMorgan Chase and Bank One completed the merger of their holding companies. The merger was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the earnings for JPMorgan Chase and Bank One are combined for all periods since completion of the merger; all time periods prior to the merger date are, on a reported basis, JPMorgan Chase only. • Merger saves and costs: For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, approximately $440 million of merger savings have bee n realized, which is an annualized rate of $1.8 billion. Management continues to estimate annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion. Approximately two - thirds of the savings are anticipated to be realized by the end of 2005. Merger costs of approximately $279 million were expensed during the second quarter of 2005, bringing the total amount expensed year -to-date to $424 million and $1.8 billion cumulative since the merger announcement. Management continues to estimate remaining merger costs o f $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, which are expected to be expensed over the next two years. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 18 Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business results on an operating basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The definition of operating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results. In the case of the Investment Bank, noninterest revenue on an operating basis includes in trading revenue net interest income related to tr ading activities. Trading activities generate revenues, which are recorded for U.S. GAAP purposes in two line items on the income statement: trading revenue, which includes the mark -to-market gains or losses on trading positions; and net interest income, which includes the interest income or expense related to those positions. Combining both the trading revenue and related net interest income enables management to evaluate the Investment Bank’s trading activities, by considering all revenue related to the se activities, and facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. In the case of Card Services, operating, or managed, basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge -offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will impact both the loan receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they w ere still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Commencing with the first quarter of 2005, operating revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax -equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax -exempt securities and investment s that receive tax credits are presented in the operating results on a basis comparable to taxable securities an d investments. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. The Corporate sector’s and the firm’s operating revenue and income tax expense for the periods prior to the first quarter of 2005 have been restated to be similarly presented on a tax -equivalent basis. The restatement had no impact on the Corporate sector’s or the firm’s operating results. Finally, as noted above, operating basis excludes the non-operating litigation charges taken in the second and first quarters of 2005 and second quarter of 2004 , merger costs and costs related to the conformance of certain accounting policies a r esult of the merger, as management believes these items are not part of the firm’s normal daily business operations and, therefore, not indicative of trends nor provide meaningful comparisons with other periods. See page 7 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (Second Quarter 2005) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to operating basis. 2. Following the merger with Bank One, JPMorgan Chase reorganized its business segments. The Investment Bank now includes portions of Bank One’s Commercial Bank; Global Treasury has been transferred to the Corporate segment. Retail Financial Services is comprised of Chase Financial Services, excluding Card Services and Middle Market, and includes Bank One’s Retail line of business and insurance activities. Card Services is the combination of Chase Card Services and Bank One Card Services. The Commercial Banking segment is comprised of Chase Middle Market, and the Middle Market portion of Bank One’s Commercial Bank. T reasury & Securities Services added Bank One’s Global Treasury Services (formerly in Commercial Bank). Asset & Wealth Management is JPMorgan Chase’s Investment Management & Private Bank plus Bank One’s Investment Management Group (excluding insurance acti vity). The Corporate segment is Bank One’s Corporate line of business excluding discontinued loan and lease portfolios (now in Retail Financial Services), plus JPMorgan Partners and Global Treasury. 3. Market share data is from Thomson Financial and is proforma for the merger of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One. 4. Pre-tax margin represents operating earnings before income taxes divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre -tax performance by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is therefore another basis by which management evaluates TSS’ and AWM’s performance and that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 19 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
