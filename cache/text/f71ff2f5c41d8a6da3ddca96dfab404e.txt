As previously announced, on May&#160;26, 2022, Broadcom Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Broadcom&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with VMware, Inc. (&#8220;VMware&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, Verona Holdco, Inc. a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of VMware (&#8220;Holdco&#8221;), Verona Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (&#8220;Merger Sub 1&#8221;), Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub 2&#8221;), and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub 3&#8221;). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i)&#160;Merger Sub 1 will be merged with and into VMware (the &#8220;First Merger&#8221;), with VMware continuing as the surviving corporation in the First Merger (the &#8220;Surviving Company&#8221;) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo; (ii)&#160;following the First Merger, the Surviving Company will be converted from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company (the &#8220;Conversion&#8221;); (iii) following the Conversion, Merger Sub 2 will be merged with and into Holdco (the &#8220;Second Merger&#8221;), with Holdco continuing as the surviving corporation in the Second Merger (the &#8220;Holdco Surviving Company&#8221;) and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom; and (iv)&#160;following the Second Merger, the Holdco Surviving Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub 3 (the &#8220;Third Merger,&#8221; and together with the First Merger, the Conversion and the Second Merger, the &#8220;Transactions&#8221;), with Merger Sub 3 continuing as the surviving limited liability company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcom. As a result of the Transactions, each share of Class&#160;A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of VMware (&#8220;VMware Common Stock&#8221;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware Common Stock, and subject to proration in accordance with the Merger Agreement as described below: (a) $142.50 per share in cash, without interest, or (b) 0.25200 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Broadcom (&#8220;Broadcom Common Stock&#8221;). The shareholder election will be subject to a proration mechanism, such that the total number of shares of VMware Common Stock entitled to receive the Cash Consideration, and the total number of shares of VMware Common Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Mergers.

From and after 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on July&#160;5, 2022, VMware must comply with customary&#160;non-solicitation&#160;restrictions. Subject to certain customary &#8220;fiduciary out&#8221; exceptions, the VMware board of directors is required to recommend that VMware&#8217;s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Transactions, which is expected to be in Broadcom&#8217;s fiscal year 2023, is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including (i)&#160;adoption of the Merger Agreement by VMware stockholders, (ii)&#160;the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, (iii)&#160;the receipt by VMware of a tax opinion to the effect that (a)&#160;the First Merger and the Conversion, taken together, and (b)&#160;the Second Merger and the Third Merger, taken together, will each qualify for federal income tax purposes as a &#8220;reorganization&#8221; within the meaning of Section&#160;368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (iv)&#160;the absence of certain orders or laws preventing consummation of the Transactions, (v)&#160;the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Broadcom with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) in connection with the Transactions and (vi)&#160;the authorization for listing on Nasdaq of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Second Merger.&#160;The obligation of each party to consummate the Transactions is also subject to other customary closing conditions, including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the other party, the accuracy of the other party&#8217;s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement and&#160;compliance in all material respects with the other party&#8217;s obligations under the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for either or each of Broadcom and VMware, including, among others: &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; by either party if the consummation of the Transactions does not occur on or before February&#160;26, 2023, subject to three extensions of three months each (at either Broadcom or VMware&#8217;s election) if on such date all of the closing conditions except those relating to regulatory approvals have been satisfied or waived; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; by either party if the Merger Agreement is not adopted by VMware&#8217;s stockholders; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; by Broadcom if the VMware board of directors changes its recommendation that VMware&#8217;s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement or VMware willfully breaches in a material respect its non-solicitation covenants; and &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; subject to the requirements of the Merger Agreement, by VMware if it wishes to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, including by VMware to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, VMware will be required to pay Broadcom a termination fee in the amount of $1.5&#160;billion, unless VMware terminates the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal prior to 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on July&#160;5, 2022, in which case VMware will be required to pay Broadcom a lower termination fee in the amount of $750&#160;million. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by either party because certain required regulatory clearances are not obtained before the Outside Date, Broadcom would be required to pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5&#160;billion.
