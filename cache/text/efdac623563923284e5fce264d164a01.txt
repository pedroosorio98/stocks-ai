The U.S. consumer remains healthy and consumer credit trends are favorable.” Dimon added: “While challenging markets impacted the industry, we maintained our leadership positions and market share in the Corporate & Investment Bank and Asset Management, reflecting the strength of our platform. Even in a challenging environment, clients continue to turn to us in the global markets and we saw positive net long-term asset flows in Asset Management.” Dimon concluded: “We are one of the most trusted financial institutions in the world, delivering consistently for our clients, communities and shareholders. We plan to increase capital return in the first half of 2016 as the board approved an incremental $1.9 billion in share buybacks. As we build for the future, we are continuously innovating and investing to succeed. We are strengthening the Firm to withstand any environment and to maintain scale and profitability through the cycle."

News Release 2 In the discussion below of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm and of its business segments, information is presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 5. Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the first quarter of 2016 versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise specified. JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Results for JPM 4Q15 1Q15 ($ millions, except per share data) 1Q16 4Q15 1Q15 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net revenue $ 24,083 $ 23,747 $ 24,820 $ 336 1% $ (737) (3)% Noninterest expense 13,837 14,263 14,883 (426) (3) (1,046) (7) Provision for credit losses 1,824 1,251 959 573 46 865 90 Net income $ 5,520 $ 5,434 $ 5,914 $ 86 2% $ (394) (7)% Earnings per share $ 1.35 $ 1.32 $ 1.45 $ 0.03 2 $ (0.10) (7) Return on tangible common equity 12% 11% 14% Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23.2 billion, $22.9 billion, and $24.1 billion for the first quarter of 2016, fourth quarter of 2015, and first quarter of 2015, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.5 billion, a decrease of 7%. Net revenue was $24.1 billion, down 3%. Noninterest revenue was $12.4 billion, down $1.5 billion, primarily as a result of the market environment impacting the results of the Corporate & Investment Bank and Asset Management. The decline was largely driven by lower Fixed Income Markets revenue and Investment Banking fees, in both cases versus strong performance in the prior- year quarter. Net interest income was $11.7 billion, up $723 million, primarily driven by loan growth and the impact of higher rates on cash, partially offset by lower investment securities. Noninterest expense was $13.8 billion, down 7%, driven by lower legal and Corporate & Investment Bank compensation expense. Provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, compared with $959 million in the prior-year quarter, predominantly due to reserve increases in the current quarter versus reserve releases in the prior-year quarter. The reserve increases in the current quarter reflected an increase in wholesale reserves of $713 million, primarily driven by downgrades, including $529 million in Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines, and $162 million in Metals & Mining.

Net revenue was $11.1 billion, up 4% over the prior-year quarter and down 1% over the prior quarter. Excluding approximately $200 million of gains from the Square IPO and a branch sale in the prior quarter, net revenue would have been up 1% over the prior quarter. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $4.6 billion, up 4%, on higher deposit balances, deposit-related fees and debit card revenue, largely offset by spread compression. Mortgage Banking net revenue was $1.9 billion, up 7%, driven by higher JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 MSR risk management results and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net revenue was $4.7 billion, up 2%, driven by higher auto lease and Card sales volumes, and higher loan balances, largely offset by the impact of renegotiated Card co-brand partnership agreements. Noninterest expense was $6.1 billion, a decrease of 2%, driven by continued expense initiatives and lower legal reserves, largely offset by higher auto lease depreciation and investments in marketing. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, an increase of 13%, as the prior-year quarter reflected reserve releases in Mortgage Banking and Student.

Net revenue was $8.1 billion, a decrease of 15%. Banking revenue was $2.4 billion, down 19%. Investment Banking revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24%, on lower debt and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. The business continued to rank #1 in Global Investment Banking fees. Treasury Services revenue was $884 million, down 5%, driven by business simplification. Lending revenue was $302 million, down 31%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans and lower gains on securities received from restructurings. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $5.7 billion, down 13%, driven by lower Markets revenue, down 11%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was down 13%, reflecting an increase in the Rates business which was more than offset by lower performance across other asset classes. Equity Markets revenue was down 5%, reflecting weaker results in Americas derivatives, partially offset by strong results in Asia derivatives. Securities Services revenue was $881 million, down 6%. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $336 million on wider credit spreads. Noninterest expense was $4.8 billion, down 15%, primarily driven by lower compensation and lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $459 million, compared to a benefit of $31 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher reserves in the Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining portfolios.

News Release 4 Discussion of Results: Net income was $496 million, a decrease of 17%. Net revenue was $1.8 billion, up 4%, driven by a 13% increase in net interest income resulting from higher loan balances and deposit spreads, largely offset by lower Investment Banking revenue compared to a record quarter last year. Noninterest expense was $713 million, up 1% compared to the prior-year quarter and down 5% compared to the prior quarter, due to an impairment on leased corporate aircraft in the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses was $304 million, compared to $61 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher reserves for the Oil and Gas portfolio and Natural Gas Pipelines.

Net revenue was $3.0 billion, a decrease of 1% including a gain on the sale of an asset. Excluding this gain, revenue in the quarter would have been lower by approximately $150 million. Net interest income was $727 million, up 17%, driven by higher deposit spreads and loan growth. Noninterest revenue was $2.2 billion, down 6%, due to the impact of lower markets and lower brokerage revenue. Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, a decrease of 5%, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation. Assets under management were $1.7 trillion, down 5%, due to the effect of lower market levels, outflows from liquidity products and the sale of an asset, partially offset by net inflows to long-term products.

Net revenue was $56 million, compared with a loss of $213 million in the prior-year quarter. The prior-year quarter included a $173 million pre-tax loss primarily related to the accelerated amortization of cash flow hedges associated with the exit of certain non-operational deposits. Noninterest expense was $153 million, flat compared to the prior-year quarter, as lower legal expense was largely offset by higher compensation expense. The current quarter included tax benefits of approximately $60 million, compared with tax benefits of $177 million in the prior- year quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a) In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b) Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c) Estimated as of 1Q16. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital rules, to which the Firm will be subject as of January 1, 2019, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For further discussion of these measures, see Capital Management on pages 149-158 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. d) Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures, and exclude Firmwide legal expense. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of this item on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
