Basis of Presentation On May 29, 2014 , Avago entered into a definitive agreement to sell LSI's flash businesses to Seagate Technology plc and on August 13, 2014 , Avago entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Axxia networking business to Intel Corporation , both of which transactions are currently expected to close in Avago's fourth fiscal quarter of 2014. Therefore the financial results from the flash and Axxia businesses, both of which were acquired by Avago in the LSI transaction, have been classified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements and the results of operations from these businesses are not included in the results presented below, unless otherwise indicated. Avago's results for its third fiscal quarter of 2014 include the results from continuing operations of the acquired LSI businesses for the full quarter, while the prior periods presented do not, as the LSI acquisition was completed at the beginning of the third fiscal quarter. The financial results provided below for the third fiscal quarter do not include any operating results of PLX Technology, Inc. , which the Company acquired on August 12, 2014 , after the end of the third quarter. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Total Revenue Compared to Guidance Avago's guidance for its third fiscal quarter of 2014 included expected contributions from both the flash and Axxia businesses. On a comparable basis, including contributions from these businesses, which have been classified as discontinued operations, GAAP net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 would have been $1,373 million and non-GAAP net revenue would have been $1,394 million .

This compares with gross margin of $357 million , or 51 percent of net revenue last quarter, and gross margin of $304 million , or 47 percent of net revenue in the same quarter last year. Operating expenses from continuing operations were $555 million . This compares with $197 million in the prior quarter and $164 million for the same quarter last year. Loss from operations was $162 million . This compares with income from operations of $160 million in the prior quarter and with income from operations of $140 million in the same quarter last year. Third quarter net loss was $164 million , or ($0.65) per diluted share. This compares with net income of $158 million , or $0.61 per diluted share, for the prior quarter, and net income of $142 million , or $0.56 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. The Company's cash balance at the end of the third fiscal quarter was $1,277 million , prior to the closing of the PLX Technology transaction, compared to $1,278 million at the end of the prior quarter which was prior to the closing of the LSI transaction. The Company generated $314 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and spent $95 million on capital expenditures.

This non-GAAP information includes the effect of purchase accounting on revenues, excludes amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, loss from discontinued operations and income tax effects of non-GAAP reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance.
