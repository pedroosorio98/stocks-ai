BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. 3555 Farnam Street Omaha, Nebraska 68131 PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS April&nbsp;30, 2016 This statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (&#147;Board&#148;) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (hereinafter &#147;Berkshire&#148; or &#147;Corporation&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;) of proxies in the accompanying form for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Saturday, April&nbsp;30, 2016 at 3:45 p.m. and at any adjournment thereof. This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy were first sent to shareholders on or about March&nbsp;11, 2016. If the form of proxy enclosed herewith is executed and returned as requested, it may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to exercise by filing an instrument revoking it or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Solicitation of proxies will be made solely by mail at the Corporation&#146;s expense. The Corporation will reimburse brokerage firms, banks, trustees and others for their actual out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding proxy material to the beneficial owners of its common stock. As of the close of business on March&nbsp;2, 2016, the record date for the Annual Meeting, the Corporation had outstanding and entitled to vote 807,242 shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (hereinafter called &#147;Class A Stock&#148;) and 1,254,393,030 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock (hereinafter called &#147;Class B Stock&#148;). Each share of Class&nbsp;A Stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of Class&nbsp;B Stock is entitled to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000)&nbsp;of one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation. The Class&nbsp;A Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class on the matters described in this proxy statement. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on April&nbsp;30, 2016 are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment thereof. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of Class&nbsp;A Stock and Class B Stock holding in the aggregate a majority of the voting power of the Corporation&#146;s stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A plurality of the votes properly cast for the election of directors by the shareholders attending the meeting, in person or by proxy, will elect directors to office. However, pursuant to the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines, if a director nominee in an uncontested election receives a greater number of votes &#147;withheld&#148; from his or her election than votes &#147;for&#148; that director&#146;s election, the nominee shall promptly offer his or her resignation to the Board. A committee consisting of the Board&#146;s independent directors (which will specifically exclude any director who is required to offer his or her own resignation) shall consider all relevant factors and decide on behalf of the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation and will determine whether to accept the resignation or take other action. The Corporation will publicly disclose the Board&#146;s decision with regard to any resignation offered under these circumstances with an explanation of how the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the offered resignation. A majority of votes properly cast upon any other question shall decide the question. Abstentions will count for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not count as votes cast for the election of directors or any other question. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the election of directors and are the equivalent of an &#147;against&#148; vote on matters requiring a majority of votes properly cast to decide the question. Broker non-votes will not count for purposes of establishing a quorum or as votes cast for the election of directors or any other question and accordingly will have no effect. Shareholders who send in proxies but attend the meeting in person may vote directly if they prefer and withdraw their proxies or may allow their proxies to be voted with the similar proxies sent in by other shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD ON APRIL 30, 2016. The Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April&nbsp;30, 2016 and the 2015 Annual Report to the Shareholders are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com/eproxy. 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS At the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a Board of Directors consisting of 12 members will be elected, each director to hold office until a successor is elected and qualified, or until the director resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee (&#147;Governance Committee&#148;) has established certain attributes that it seeks in identifying candidates for directors. In particular the Governance Committee looks for individuals who have very high integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude and a deep genuine interest in Berkshire. These are the same attributes that Warren Buffett, Berkshire&#146;s Chairman and CEO, believes to be essential if one is to be an effective member of the Board of Directors. In considering candidates for director, the Governance Committee considers the entirety of each candidate&#146;s credentials in the context of these attributes. In the judgment of the Governance Committee as well as that of the Board as a whole, each of the candidates being nominated for director possesses such attributes.

The Corporation expects each nominee to be able to serve if elected, but if any nominee notifies the Corporation before the annual meeting that he or she is unable to do so, then the proxies will be voted for the remainder of those nominated and, as designated by the directors, may be voted (i)&nbsp;for a substitute nominee or nominees, or (ii)&nbsp;to elect such lesser number to constitute the whole Board as equals the number of nominees who are able to serve. &nbsp; 3 Directors&#146; Independence The Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has concluded that the following directors are independent in accordance with the director independence standards of the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Item&nbsp;407(a) of Regulation S-K, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Corporation which would impair his or her independence from management or otherwise compromise his or her ability to act as an independent director: Stephen B. Burke; Susan L. Decker; William H. Gates III; David S. Gottesman; Charlotte Guyman; Thomas S. Murphy; Walter Scott, Jr. and Meryl B. Witmer. In making its determination with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Scott, the Governance Committee considered his role as a director of and the holder (along with family members and related entities) of 9.1% of the voting stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (&#147;BHE&#148;) in which the Corporation owns approximately 89.9% of the voting stock. The Governance Committee also considered the agreement between the Corporation and Mr.&nbsp;Scott that requires Mr.&nbsp;Scott and his related family interests, before selling their BHE shares, to give the Corporation the right of first refusal to purchase their shares (if the Corporation is legally permitted to buy them) or the opportunity to assign its right to purchase to a third party (if it is not legally permitted to buy them). That same agreement also gives Mr.&nbsp;Scott and his related family interests the right to put their shares to the Corporation (if the Corporation is legally permitted to buy them) at fair market value to be determined by independent appraisal if the sellers do not agree with the price offered by the Corporation, and payable in Berkshire shares. The Governance Committee considered these relationships in light of the attributes it believes need to be possessed by independent-minded directors, including personal financial substance and a lack of economic dependence on the Corporation, as well as business wisdom and ownership of Berkshire shares. The Governance Committee concluded that Mr.&nbsp;Scott&#146;s relationships, rather than interfering with his ability to be independent from management, are consistent with the business and financial substance that have made and continue to make him an independent director. In making its determination with respect to Mr.&nbsp;Gates, the Governance Committee considered that Mr.&nbsp;Gates and his wife are trustees of the Bill&nbsp;&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (&#147;Gates Foundation&#148;) that since 2006 has received donations from Warren Buffett of 200,631,548 Class B shares of the Corporation. These shares were received in connection with Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s pledge to donate Class B Stock to the Gates Foundation over the remainder of Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s life. Terms of his pledge are described on Berkshire&#146;s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com under the heading &#147;Letters from Warren E. Buffett Regarding Pledges to Make Gifts of Berkshire Stock.&#148; The Governance Committee considered these relationships in light of the attributes it believes need to be possessed by independent-minded directors, including personal financial substance and a lack of economic dependence on the Corporation, as well as business wisdom and ownership of Berkshire shares. The Governance Committee concluded that Mr.&nbsp;Gates&#146; relationship to the Gates Foundation had no impact on his independence and that he continues to qualify as an independent director. Howard G. Buffett is the son of Warren Buffett. Ronald L. Olson is a partner of the law firm of Munger, Tolles&nbsp;&amp; Olson LLP. Munger, Tolles&nbsp;&amp; Olson LLP rendered legal services to the Corporation and its subsidiaries in 2015 and has been rendering services in 2016. The Corporation and its subsidiaries paid fees of $4.1 million to Munger, Tolles&nbsp;&amp; Olson LLP during 2015. Board of Directors&#146; Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight Warren E. Buffett is Berkshire&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. He is Berkshire&#146;s largest shareholder and owns shares of Berkshire that represent 33.0% of the voting interest and 18.8% of the economic interest. As such he may be deemed to be Berkshire&#146;s controlling shareholder. It is Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s opinion that a controlling shareholder who is active in the business, as is currently the case and has been the case for Mr.&nbsp;Buffett for the last 46 years, should hold both roles. This opinion is shared by Berkshire&#146;s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not named a lead independent director. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett and the other members of the Board of Directors extensively discuss succession planning at each meeting of the Board. Upon his death or inability to manage Berkshire, no member of the Buffett family will be involved in managing Berkshire but, as very substantial Berkshire shareholders, the Buffett family will assist the Board of Directors in picking and overseeing the CEO selected to succeed Mr.&nbsp;Buffett. At that time, Mr.&nbsp;Buffett believes it would be prudent to have a member of the Buffett family serve as the non-executive Chairman of the Board. Ultimately, however, that decision will be the responsibility of the then Board of Directors. The full Board of Directors has responsibility for general oversight of risks. It receives reports from Mr.&nbsp;Buffett and other members of senior management at least twice a year on areas of risk facing the Corporation. Also, at least once a year, the senior management of each of the Corporation&#146;s significant businesses reports to the Board of Directors on risks facing their respective businesses. In addition, as part of its charter, the Audit Committee discusses Berkshire&#146;s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Board of Directors&#146; Meetings Board of Directors&#146; actions were taken in 2015 at the Annual Meeting of Directors that followed the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and at three special meetings and upon one occasion by directors&#146; unanimous written consent. Each then current director attended all meetings of the Board and of the Committees of the Board on which he or she served except that David S. Gottesman did not attend one of the special meetings of the Board of Directors. Directors are encouraged but not required to attend annual meetings of the Corporation&#146;s shareholders. All directors of the Corporation attended the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. &nbsp; 4 Meetings of Non-Management and Independent Directors Two meetings of non-management directors were held during 2015. Mr.&nbsp;Ronald&nbsp;L. Olson presided as ad hoc chair of the meetings. In addition, following one of the meetings of non-management directors, a meeting of directors determined to be independent was held. Mr.&nbsp;Walter Scott, Jr. presided as ad hoc chair of that meeting. A shareholder or other interested party wishing to contact the non-management directors or independent directors, as applicable, should send a letter to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation that the enclosed letter is to be forwarded to the Corporation&#146;s non-management directors or independent directors, as applicable. Board of Directors&#146; Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee in accordance with Section&nbsp;3(a)(58)A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2015, the Audit Committee consisted of Susan L. Decker, Charlotte Guyman and Thomas S. Murphy. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr.&nbsp;Murphy and Ms.&nbsp;Decker are each an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; as that term is used in Item&nbsp;401(h) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. All current members of the Audit Committee meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act and in Section&nbsp;303A of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. The Audit Committee assists the Board with oversight of a) the integrity of the Corporation&#146;s financial statements, b) the Corporation&#146;s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and c) the qualifications and independence of the Corporation&#146;s independent public accountants and the Corporation&#146;s internal audit function. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the Corporation&#146;s independent public accountants, Director of Internal Auditing and members of management and reviews the Corporation&#146;s accounting policies and internal controls. The Audit Committee also selects the firm of independent public accountants to be retained by the Corporation to perform the audit. The Audit Committee held six meetings during 2015. The Board of Directors adopted an Audit Committee Charter on April&nbsp;29, 2000, which was subsequently amended and restated on March&nbsp;2, 2004. The amended Audit Committee Charter is available on Berkshire&#146;s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com . The Board of Directors has established a Governance Committee and adopted a Charter to define and outline the responsibilities of its members. A copy of the Governance Committee&#146;s Charter is available on Berkshire&#146;s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com . The Governance Committee consists of Susan L. Decker, David S. Gottesman, Walter Scott, Jr. and Meryl B. Witmer, all of whom are independent directors in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange director independence standards. The role of the Governance Committee is to assist the Board of Directors by a) recommending governance guidelines applicable to Berkshire; b) identifying, evaluating and recommending the nomination of Board members; c) setting the compensation of Berkshire&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and performing other compensation oversight; d) reviewing related persons transactions and e)&nbsp;assisting the Board with other related tasks, as assigned from time to time. The Governance Committee met twice during 2015. Director Nominations Berkshire does not have a policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying nominees for director. In identifying director nominees, the Governance Committee does not seek diversity, however defined. Instead, as previously discussed, the Governance Committee looks for individuals who have very high integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude and a deep genuine interest in the Company. With respect to the selection of director nominees at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Governance Committee recommends the Board nominate each of the 12 directors currently serving on the Board. Berkshire&#146;s Governance Committee has a policy under which it will consider recommendations presented by shareholders. A shareholder wishing to submit such a recommendation should send a letter to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation that the enclosed letter is a &#147;Director Nominee Recommendation.&#148; The Secretary must receive the recommendation by December&nbsp;12, 2016, for it to be considered by the Committee for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The letter must identify the author as a shareholder and provide a brief summary of the candidate&#146;s qualifications. At a minimum, candidates recommended for nomination to the Board of Directors must meet the director independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Governance Committee&#146;s policy provides that candidates recommended by shareholders will be evaluated using the same criteria as are applied to all other candidates. Director Compensation Directors of the Corporation or its subsidiaries who are employees or spouses of employees do not receive fees for attendance at directors&#146; meetings. A director who is not an employee or a spouse of an employee receives a fee of $900 for each meeting attended in person and $300 for participating in any meeting conducted by telephone. A director who serves as a member of the Audit Committee receives a fee of $1,000 quarterly. Directors are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of directors or shareholders. The Company does not provide directors and officers liability insurance to its directors. &nbsp; 5 The following table provides compensation information for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 for each non-management member of the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fees&nbsp;Earned or&nbsp;Paid&nbsp;in&nbsp;Cash &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Total &nbsp; Howard G.

Witmer &nbsp;&nbsp; Class A &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Class B &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Directors and executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Class A &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 334,195 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 41.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;officers as a group &nbsp;&nbsp; Class B &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 75,561,480 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.0 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 36.6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 23.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; * less than 0.1%. &nbsp; (1) &nbsp; Beneficial owners exercise both sole voting and sole investment power unless otherwise stated. Each share of Class&nbsp;A Stock is convertible into 1,500 shares of Class B Stock at the option of the shareholder. As a result, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a shareholder is deemed to have beneficial ownership of the shares of Class B Stock which such shareholder may acquire upon conversion of the Class&nbsp;A Stock. In order to avoid overstatement, the amount of Class B Stock beneficially owned does not take into account such shares of Class B Stock which may be acquired upon conversion (an amount which is equal to 1,500 times the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A Stock held by a shareholder). The percentage of outstanding Class B Stock is based on the total number of shares of Class B Stock outstanding as of March&nbsp;2, 2016 and does not take into account shares of Class B Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Class&nbsp;A Stock. &nbsp; (2) &nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Buffett has entered into a voting agreement with Berkshire providing that, should the combined voting power of Berkshire shares as to which Mr.&nbsp;Buffett has or shares voting and investment power exceed 49.9% of Berkshire&#146;s total voting power, he will vote those shares in excess of that percentage proportionately with votes of the other Berkshire shareholders. &nbsp; (3) &nbsp; Includes 859 Class&nbsp;A shares held by a private foundation for which Mr.&nbsp;Buffett possesses voting and investment power but with respect to which he disclaims any beneficial interest. &nbsp; (4) &nbsp; Includes 4,050 Class&nbsp;A shares held by a single-member limited liability company of which Mr.&nbsp;Gates is the sole member and 72,743,548 Class B shares owned by the Bill&nbsp;&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust of which Mr.&nbsp;Gates and his wife are co-trustees but with respect to which Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Gates disclaim any beneficial interest. &nbsp; (5) &nbsp; Includes 10,313 Class&nbsp;A shares and 2,604,028 Class B shares as to which Mr.&nbsp;Gottesman or his wife has shared voting power and 6,190 Class&nbsp;A shares and 2,519,163 Class B shares as to which Mr.&nbsp;Gottesman or his wife has shared investment power. Mr.&nbsp;Gottesman has a pecuniary interest in 6,425 Class&nbsp;A shares and 395 Class B shares included herein. &nbsp; (6) &nbsp; Includes 193 Class&nbsp;A shares and 400 Class B shares held by four trusts for which Mr.&nbsp;Olson is a trustee but with respect to which Mr.&nbsp;Olson disclaims any beneficial interest. &nbsp; (7) &nbsp; Does not include 2 Class&nbsp;A shares owned by Ms.&nbsp;Witmer&#146;s husband and 2 Class&nbsp;A shares owned by her two children. &nbsp; 7 Compensation Discussion and Analysis Berkshire&#146;s program regarding compensation of its executive officers is different from most public company programs. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s and Mr.&nbsp;Munger&#146;s compensation is reviewed annually by the Governance Committee of the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors. Due to Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s and Mr.&nbsp;Munger&#146;s desire that their compensation remain unchanged, the Committee has not proposed an increase in Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s or Mr.&nbsp;Munger&#146;s compensation since the Committee was created in 2004. Prior to that time Mr.&nbsp;Buffett recommended to the Board of Directors the amount of his compensation and Mr.&nbsp;Munger&#146;s. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett&#146;s and Mr.&nbsp;Munger&#146;s annual compensation has each been $100,000 for more than 25 years and Mr.&nbsp;Buffett has advised the Committee that he would not expect or desire such compensation to increase in the future. The Committee has established a policy that: (i)&nbsp;neither the profitability of Berkshire nor the market value of its stock are to be considered in the compensation of any executive officer; and (ii)&nbsp;all compensation paid to executive officers of Berkshire be deductible under Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;162(m). Under the Committee&#146;s compensation policy, Berkshire does not grant stock options to executive officers. The Committee has delegated to Mr.&nbsp;Buffett the responsibility for setting the compensation of Mr.&nbsp;Hamburg, Berkshire&#146;s Senior Vice President/Chief Financial Officer. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett will on occasion utilize Berkshire personnel and/or have Berkshire pay for minor items such as postage or phone calls that are personal. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett reimburses Berkshire for these costs by making an annual payment to Berkshire in an amount that is equal to or greater than the costs that Berkshire has incurred on his behalf. During 2015, Mr.&nbsp;Buffett reimbursed Berkshire $50,000. Berkshire provides personal and home security services for Mr.&nbsp;Buffett. The cost for these services was $370,244 in 2015. It should be noted that many large companies maintain security departments that provide costly services to top executives but for which no itemization is provided in their proxy statements. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett and Mr.&nbsp;Munger do not use Company cars or belong to clubs to which the Company pays dues. It should also be noted that neither Mr.&nbsp;Buffett nor Mr.&nbsp;Munger utilizes corporate-owned aircraft for personal use. Each of them is personally a fractional NetJets owner, paying standard rates, and they use Berkshire-owned aircraft for business purposes only. Factors considered by Mr.&nbsp;Buffett in setting Mr.&nbsp;Hamburg&#146;s salary are typically subjective, such as his perception of Mr.&nbsp;Hamburg&#146;s performance and any changes in functional responsibility. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett also sets the compensation for each of the CEO&#146;s of Berkshire&#146;s significant operating businesses. He utilizes many different incentive arrangements, with their terms dependent on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of the business. The incentives can be large and are always tied to the operating results for which the CEO has authority. These incentives are related to measures over which the CEO has control. The following table discloses the compensation received for the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 by the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, its other executive officer and its Chief Financial Officer.

Based on the review and discussion referred to on page 8, we recommend that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company&#146;s Proxy. Submitted by the members of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors. &nbsp; Walter Scott, Jr., Chairman &nbsp; David S. Gottesman Susan L. Decker &nbsp; Meryl B. Witmer Section&nbsp;16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section&nbsp;16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Corporation&#146;s officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Corporation&#146;s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Officers, directors and greater than ten-percent shareholders are required by the regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission to furnish the Corporation with copies of all Section&nbsp;16(a) forms they file. Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, and written representations from certain reporting persons that no Section&nbsp;16(a) forms were required for those persons, the Corporation believes that during 2015 all filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than ten-percent shareholders were complied with. Independent Public Accountants Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP (&#147;Deloitte&#148;) served as the Corporation&#146;s principal independent public accountants for 2015. Representatives from that firm will be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to any appropriate questions. The Corporation has not selected independent public accountants for the current year, since its normal practice is for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to make such selection later in the year. The following table shows the fees paid or accrued for audit services and fees paid for audit-related, tax and all other services rendered by Deloitte for each of the last two years (in millions): &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Audit Fees (a) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 35.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 32.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; Audit-Related Fees (b) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; Tax Fees (c) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.9 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 38.1 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 35.5 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Audit fees include fees for the audit of the Corporation&#146;s consolidated financial statements and interim reviews of the Corporation&#146;s quarterly financial statements, audit services provided in connection with required statutory audits of many of the Corporation&#146;s insurance subsidiaries and certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries and comfort letters, consents and other services related to Securities and Exchange Commission matters. &nbsp; (b) Audit-related fees primarily include fees for certain audits of subsidiaries not required for purposes of Deloitte&#146;s audit of the Corporation&#146;s consolidated financial statements or for any other statutory or regulatory requirements, audits of certain subsidiary employee benefit plans and consultations on various accounting and reporting matters. &nbsp; (c) Tax fees include fees for services relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and international tax compliance, tax return preparation and tax audits. The Audit Committee has considered whether the non-audit services provided to the Company by Deloitte impaired the independence of Deloitte and concluded that they did not. All of the services performed by Deloitte were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy adopted by the Audit Committee on May&nbsp;5, 2003. The policy provides guidelines for audit, audit related, tax and other non-audit services that may be provided by Deloitte to the Company. The policy (a)&nbsp;identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that Deloitte&#146;s independence is not impaired; (b)&nbsp;describes the audit, audit-related and tax services that may be provided and the non-audit services that are prohibited; and (c)&nbsp;sets forth pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. Under the policy, requests to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Company&#146;s independent auditor and its Chief Financial Officer. All requests for services to be provided by the independent auditor that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. The Chief Financial Officer will determine whether such services are included within the list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by the independent auditor. &nbsp; 9 Report of the Audit Committee February&nbsp;24, 2016 To the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. We have reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to be set forth in the Corporation&#146;s 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders and at Item&nbsp;8 of the Corporation&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 with management of the Corporation and Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP, independent public accountants for the Corporation. We have discussed with Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;), as adopted in Auditing Standard No.&nbsp;16 (Communications with Audit Committees). We have received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP required by the applicable PCAOB requirements for independent accountant communications with audit committees with respect to auditor independence and have discussed with Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP its independence from the Corporation. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Corporation&#146;s financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; that is the responsibility of management and the Corporation&#146;s independent public accountants. In giving its recommendation to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee has relied on (i)&nbsp;management&#146;s representation that such financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and (ii)&nbsp;the reports of the Corporation&#146;s independent public accountants with respect to such financial statements. Based on the review and discussions with management of the Corporation and Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP referred to above, we recommend to the Board of Directors that the Corporation publish the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and subsidiaries for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in the Corporation&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Corporation&#146;s 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders. Submitted by the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. &nbsp; Thomas S. Murphy, Chairman &nbsp; Charlotte Guyman Susan L. Decker &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL The Nebraska Peace Foundation owns one share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and has given notice that a representative of the Nebraska Peace Foundation intends to present for action at the meeting the following proposal. WHEREAS: Climate change is a slow-moving process relative to many other public policy issues. Nonetheless, the future of the world&#146;s climate system hinges heavily on actions taken by governments, corporations, and individuals over the next few decades. Claims exposure to weather-related events requires that insurance and reinsurance companies take the lead in evaluating and managing the impact of extreme weather. Meanwhile, climate change could have unanticipated adverse effects on the investments of insurers. AND WHEREAS: Reporting of risks helps companies better integrate and gain strategic value from existing operations, identify and anticipate gaps and opportunities, develop company-wide communications, and receive feedback. Reporting on the impact of climate change for Berkshire Hathaway insurance companies would confirm their status as leaders in the global insurance industry, complementing the leadership BH energy companies demonstrate in the provision of renewable energy. BE IT RESOLVED: Shareholders request the BH insurance division, within a reasonable period of time, issue a report describing the division&#146;s responses to the risks posed by climate change. The report should include specific initiatives and goals relating to each risk issue identified; be prepared at a reasonable cost; and omit proprietary information. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Insurance regulators worldwide are exploring the implication of climate change-related risks for the insurance sector and adapting their supervisory approach. In 2013 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the US adopted revisions to the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook to support examiners in assessing any potential impact of climate change on solvency of insurance firms. In September 2015, the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England (responsible for regulation of UK insurance companies) issued an 85-page report outlining the risks facing the insurance industry as a result of climate change. The PRA has indicated it expects PRA-regulated insurance firms to consider the risks identified. The impact of climate change on the UK insurance sector: A climate change adaptation report by the Prudential Regulation Authority identifies three climate-change risk factors affecting insurers: &#147;(i) Physical risks: the first-order risks which arise from weather-related events&#133;such as damage to property, and also those that may arise indirectly through subsequent events, such as disruption of global supply chains or resource scarcity. &nbsp; 10 &#147;(ii) Transition risks: the financial risk which could arise for insurance firms from the transition to a lower-carbon economy. For insurance firms, this risk factor is mainly about the potential re-pricing of carbon-intensive financial assets, and the speed at which any such re-pricing might occur&#133; &#147;(iii) Liability risks: risks&#133;from parties who have suffered loss and damage from climate change, and then seek to recover losses from others who they believe may have been responsible&#133;[through] third-party liability contracts such as professional indemnity or directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance.&#148; The operations and capital strength of BH insurance companies would benefit greatly from a thorough internal review of the risks posed by climate change. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: The Board of Directors shares the views of Berkshire&#146;s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett as to why Berkshire shareholders should vote against the shareholder proposal. Mr.&nbsp;Buffett described his reasons in his letter to Berkshire shareholders that is included in Berkshire&#146;s 2015 Annual Report. A condensed summary of his thoughts regarding this proposal follow. It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say &#147;highly likely&#148; rather than &#147;certain&#148; because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most &#147;experts&#148; about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world, if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the threat. If there is only a 1% chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is foolhardy. Call this Noah&#146;s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival , begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear. It&#146;s understandable that the sponsor of the proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by climate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property losses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums. Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent or more costly hurricanes or other weather-related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years which is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely &#150; though far from certain &#150; effect on Berkshire&#146;s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable. As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up at nights. As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries. Proxies given without instructions will be voted against this shareholder proposal. &nbsp; 3.
