( &#8220;Nu &#8221; or &#8220; Company &#8221;), hereby informs its shareholders and the market, in consideration of the Brazilian Central Bank (&quot; BCB &quot;) Resolution N&ordm;. 246 (&quot; BCB Resolution 246 &quot;) issued today, which established, among other matters, a maximum limit for the interchange fee of the prepaid cards, as follows: &nbsp; Changes in the interchange fee for prepaid cards in Brazil were widely expected by the market since the publication by the BCB, on October 8, 2021, of the Public Consultation Notice N&ordm; 89 (&quot; ECP 89/2021 &quot;), having been mentioned in the Registration Statement on the Company's Form 20-F and considered on its planning, even though the timing of its implementation at the time was uncertain. &nbsp; The BCB Resolution 246 established that the maximum limit for the interchange fee levied on all prepaid card transactions in Brazil will be 0.70%. The new rules come into force on April 1, 2023. &nbsp; Interchange fees on prepaid cards represented 7.0% of the Company's revenue in the 12 months from July 2021 to June 2022. If the changes announced by Resolution BCB 246 were in effect since July 1st, 2021, the Company's revenue would have been adversely affected by 2.9%. &nbsp; We will continue to monitor the new rules to be enacted by the Brazilian Central Bank, as well as any other adjustments proposed by Mastercard on this matter, and we will keep the market informed of any new developments. &nbsp; &nbsp; Contacts Investor Relations Guilherme Lago investors@nubank.com.br Media Leila Suwwan press@nubank.com.br &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By:&nbsp; /s/ Guilherme Lago &nbsp; &nbsp; Guilherme Lago Chief Financial Officer &nbsp; Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;September 26, 2022 &nbsp;
