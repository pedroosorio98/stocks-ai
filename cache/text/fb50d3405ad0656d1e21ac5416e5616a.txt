Does Mate preserve their knowledge? Yes. Their expertise stays - for both agents and analysts. When a senior analyst leaves, their investigation knowledge stays too: how to handle DLP alerts, check custom apps for user context, and navigate your compliance portal. These workflows become lasting organizational capability. Your SOC capability compounds instead of resetting with every departure. I already have automation - why would I buy another tool? Your SOARs, SIEMs, and automations assume security is predictable - it’s not. They break when things change. Mate elevates your team by using organizational wisdom to adapt in real time - pulling context, correlating data, working with custom apps, and giving analysts the right data at the right moment. What makes Mate different from other AI SOC solutions? Three things set Mate apart: instant organizational context, works with any tool, and keeps getting smarter. Most AI SOC tools start blank and need weeks to tune. Mate learns your organization in hours, including its tools, policies, and context. It connects to everything analysts use, from legacy systems to scripts, portals, and Excel, and keeps learning from every investigation to become your organization’s brain. Can Mate work in our unique complex environment with our custom-built tools, scripts, and homegrown systems? Yes. Mate works across your entire security ecosystem. Enterprise security spans years of configurations, from firewall rules and Terraform setups to custom apps and knowledge stored in wikis and SOPs. This knowledge lives everywhere, not just in your SIEM or EDR, and Mate works with all of it. The result is full coverage across your real environment and the accumulated wisdom behind it. How can Mate deliver value on Day 1 if it hasn’t learned anything yet? Most investigations start from zero, forcing analysts to rebuild context each time. Mate changes that. It instantly learns your organization by ingesting tickets, documentation, incidents, configurations, and behavior patterns in hours, not months. With full context from past investigations and decisions across teams, a “suspicious login from new geo-location” is resolved in seconds. Does Mate only generate insights or can it also take actions? Mate doesn’t just advise, it acts. It gathers evidence, correlates data, and as you build trust, can make decisions and close tickets with full documentation. For complex threats, it handles the manual work so analysts can focus on security thinking. You control the autonomy and keep oversight as trust builds. The result: simple cases resolved in seconds, complex ones in minutes. put wisdom to work Get a Mate talk to a human © All Rights Reserved 2025 Mate | Privacy Policy | CCPA Notice | Trust Center
