In Consumer & Community Banking, we had strong deposit and client investment asset growth. Our consumer lending businesses benefited from our continued investments and a favorable environment for borrowers, which helped drive healthy volumes in Home Lending and Auto and strong loan growth in Card.” Dimon added: “We had record third quarter IB fees with particularly strong performance in DCM and ECM, and year-to-date we maintained our #1 global ranking with share gains across products and regions. Markets performance was solid, reflecting improved client activity – particularly in Fixed Income. Commercial Banking turned in a solid performance with continued momentum in investment banking and treasury services. And in Asset & Wealth Management, both AUM and client assets were a record helped by strong net inflows into long-term and liquidity products.” Dimon concluded: “In the U.S. economy, GDP growth has slowed slightly. The consumer remains healthy with growth in wages and spending, combined with strong balance sheets and low unemployment levels. This is being offset by weakening business sentiment and capital expenditures mostly driven by increasingly complex geopolitical risks, including tensions in global trade. Regardless of the operating environment, JPMorgan Chase will continue to serve our customers, clients and communities globally, while investing in innovation, talent, technology, security and controls.” FORTRESS PRINCIPLES Book value per share of $75.24, up 8%; tangible book value per share2 of $60.48, up 9% Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $188 billion and ratio3 of 12.3% Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.3% OPERATING LEVERAGE 3Q19 reported expense of $16.4 billion; reported overhead ratio of 56%; managed overhead ratio2 of 55% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED $9.6 billion5 distributed to shareholders in 3Q19 $6.7 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.90 per share SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $1.7 trillion of credit and capital7 raised YTD $188 billion of credit for consumers $25 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $630 billion of credit for corporations $785 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $53 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 In the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), information is presented on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, unless otherwise specified.

JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Net revenue on a reported basis was $29.3 billion, $28.8 billion, and $27.3 billion for the third quarter of 2019, second quarter of 2019, and third quarter of 2018, respectively.

Net revenue was $30.1 billion, up 8%. Net interest income was $14.4 billion, up 2%, largely driven by continued balance sheet growth and mix, largely offset by the impact of rates. Noninterest revenue was $15.7 billion, up $1.9 billion or 14%, and included approximately $350 million of gains related to loan sales in Home Lending8. Excluding these gains, the increase in noninterest revenue was largely driven by results in Fixed Income Markets in the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as Home Lending and Auto in Consumer & Community Banking. Noninterest expense was $16.4 billion, up 5%, driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expenses and investments, including compensation and auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, up $566 million, largely as a result of reserve releases and net recoveries in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was $14.3 billion, up 7%.

Home Lending net revenue was $1.5 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher net production revenue, largely offset by lower net interest income on lower loan balances. Card, Merchant Services & Auto net revenue was $6.1 billion, up 9%, driven by higher Card net interest income on loan growth and margin expansion, and higher auto lease volumes. Noninterest expense was $7.3 billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by investments in the business including marketing and technology, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.

The provision for credit losses was $44 million, driven by net charge-offs, as well as reserve builds predominantly due to loan growth.

Net revenue was $692 million, compared with a net loss of $103 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income and noninterest revenue.

Higher noninterest revenue reflected small net gains on certain legacy private equity investments compared to net losses in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $281 million was up $253 million due to higher investments in technology and a higher net legal benefit in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $75.24, $73.88 and $69.52 at September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2018, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.

Credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking.

Noninterest revenue in CCB in the third quarter of 2019 included approximately $350 million of gains on loan sales in Home Lending. These gains were predominantly offset by a charge in net interest income in CCB for the unwind of the related internal funding from Treasury and CIO associated with these loans. This net interest income charge was offset by corresponding income recognized in Treasury and CIO. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
