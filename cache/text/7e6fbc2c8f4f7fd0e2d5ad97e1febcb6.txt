(d) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") capital transition provisions which expired on December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021 will be phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining 75%, or $2.2 billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. For the periods ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $2.9 billion, $3.3 billion, $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. For the period ended March 31, 2021, the SLR reflected the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS (in millions, except ratios) The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on managed basis. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Effective January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit recognized as of December 31, 2021 will be phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of March 31, 2022, CET1 capital reflected the remaining 75%, or $2.2 billion, benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. For the periods ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $2.9 billion, $3.3 billion, $3.8 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. For the period ended March 31, 2021, the SLR reflected the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of the Firm’s 2021 Form 10-K for additional information. (b) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratios, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly goodwill and other intangible assets.

The Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized a new common equity share repurchase program up to $30 billion effective May 1, 2022 that will replace the current program. (b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee stock options and SARs. (c) On September 21, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.00 per share. Page 10 JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

(b) The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses relates to loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR; the Firm calculates this allowance based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. (c) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. (d) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding CIB’s trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the wholesale allowance coverage ratio.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures (a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. (b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. (c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. (d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio. (e) In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”), net yield, and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets), as shown below. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income.These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk- managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2021 Form 10-K.
