The user needs three search queries to help plan the sections of their Taiwan night market food tour report. The tour starts at Taipei Music Center, let’s say it takes the MRT to Raohe, then Ningxia, and ends at Shilin by 21:30. Each stop has specific iconic foods. The report sections probably break down each market visit, the foods, timing, etc. The queries should help answer questions in the report's sections. Let's look at the plan's components: locations (markets), specific foods, timing, transportation (MRT), and ensuring the Scenario 1 A shadow cast by a tree on the right briefly obscures a pedestrian stepping out from between packed cars, causing the ego driver to slow further. ¶¬OÂÚ×½é»IêiC`qÝÚºÒI Üb內Â\o»Ýe@ìI¨B Physical AI The Foundation of Robotic Revolution Scenario 2 A car is stopped on a quiet suburban road, with a clear blue sky overhead and lush green trees lining the streets. A pigeon enters the frame from the right, flying low over the street with graceful, fluid movements. It gracefully glides past the parked cars, then lands softly on one of the vehicles. The scene captures a serene moment, with the pigeon's flight adding a touch of life to the tranquil neighborhood setting. A wide- angle shot from inside the car, capturing both the bird and the surrounding environment. ¶¬OÂÚ×½é»IêiC`qÝÚºÒI Üb內Â\o»Ýe@ìI¨B Physical AI The Foundation of Robotic Revolution Physical AI The Foundation of Robotic Revolution Scenario 3 The car is stopping on the road.

The task is to pick up the mug on the table. First, I need to confirm that the "mug" shown is the same as the "water bottle" shown in the video. The user might be using "mug" interchangeably with "water bottle." Let me check the video again. The objects on the table are: Robot Arm 1 (left), Robot Arm 2 (right), a spray bottle (left center), a water bottle (center), a black lid (right of the water bottle), and a purple container (far right). The instruction is to pick up the mug. Since there's no explicit mention of a mug, but there's a water \NRNVIDIA »¢I¨éCÀçjçjn´úü屜B 在開始之前，解釋你將採取的每個步驟。 General Robotics Opens the Next Trillion-Dollar Industry Grace Blackwell NVL72 “A Thinking Machine” GB300 NVL72 Grace Blackwell Ultra Superchip 40 PFLOPS TE FP4 576 GB at 16 TB/s HBM3e 800 Gb/s CX8 1.5X GB200 1.5X GB200 2X GB200 Grace Blackwell NVL72 “A Thinking Machine” GB300 NVL72 CoreWeave 220 MW USA, Scaling Globally Courtesy of CoreWeave Courtesy of Oracle Oracle Cloud - Supercluster 260 MW Indonesia, Scaling Globally Courtesy of xAI xAI - Colossus 150 MW Memphis, Tennessee Stargate 200 MW, Scaling to 1.2 GW Abilene, Texas Courtesy of Crusoe Announcing Foxconn, Taiwan, TSMC and NVIDIA Build AI Infrastructure for Taiwan Grace Blackwell NVL72 “One Giant GPU” Custom ASIC with NVLink Fusion IP Announcing NVLink Fusion NVIDIA AI Factory Plus Custom ASIC Custom CPU with NVLink Fusion IP Announcing NVLink Fusion NVIDIA AI Factory Plus Custom CPU NVIDIA Plus ASIC Hybrid AI Infrastructure Proven Scale-Up and Scale-Out Ecosystem Single Scalable Hardware Architecture NVIDIA NVLink Fusion Semi-Custom AI Infrastructure RTX PRO Laptop RTX PRO Workstation RTX PRO Server DGX B200/B300 DGX Spark DGX Station GB200 / GB300 NVL72 AI Storage Server x86 PlatformsArm Platforms One Architecture – from Cloud AI, Enterprise AI, Personal AI, to Edge AI ConnectX-8 SuperNIC 800 Gb/s Network Connection 800 GB Unified System Memory Up to 1T Parameter Models 20 PFLOPS AI Performance GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Superchip Announcing DGX Station 1 Trillion Parameter Models Personal AI Machine AI Infrastructure AIOPS Agentic AI COMPUTE STORAGE NETWORKING CUDA-X NEMO OMNIVERSE AI-Q DOCA NVIDIA Enterprise AI Platform Accelerates Trillion-Dollar Global IT Investment $1T Enterprise IT and Industrial Automation Software Industry ConnectX-8 SuperNIC Switch 800 GB/s All-to-All Bandwidth 800 GB GPU Memory 13 TB/s Bandwidth 30 PFLOPS FP4 AI Performance 8 x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs 3 PFLOPS RTX Graphics Performance Real-Time Omniverse Digital Twin Simulation Announcing NVIDIA RTX PRO Server Enterprise AI and Industrial AI Computing Platform Llama 70B 8K ISL / 256 OSL Announcing NVIDIA RTX PRO Server Enterprise AI and Industrial AI Computing Platform DeepSeek R1 128K ISL / 4K OSL Announcing NVIDIA RTX PRO Server Enterprise AI and Industrial AI Computing Platform Available Now Announcing NVIDIA RTX PRO Server Enterprise AI and Industrial AI Computing Platform Storage NVIDIA BlueField Networking NVIDIA Spectrum-X Compute RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition NVIDIA BlueField NVIDIA Llama Nemotron Reason PlanCritique Tool Use Prompt Response Calculator SQL Query Semantic Query Web Search Generate Summary NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint NVIDIA AI Data Platform Open Reasoning Models Llama Nemotron Higher Retrieval Accuracy NeMo Retriever 50% Greater Faster Data Extraction NeMo Retriever 15X Faster #1 NVIDIA Top Leaderboard Open Models and Datasets AI Infrastructure AIOPS Agentic AI SecureGuardrailMonitorSearchBuildTest and EvaluateData Curate COMPUTE STORAGE NETWORKING CUDA-X NEMO OMNIVERSE AI-Q DOCA Orchestrate NVIDIA Enterprise AI Platform Accelerates Trillion-Dollar Global IT Investment AI Infrastructure AIOPS Agentic AI SecureGuardrailMonitorSearchBuildTest and EvaluateData Curate COMPUTE STORAGE NETWORKING CUDA-X NEMO OMNIVERSE AI-Q DOCA Orchestrate NVIDIA Enterprise AI Platform Accelerates Trillion-Dollar Global IT Investment Jetson Thor Prompt Action Sensor Input NVIDIA Isaac NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Open Humanoid Robot Development Platform 6K Model Downloads 3.6K GitHub Stars Prompt Action Sensor Input Announcing NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.5 Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model Action Labeling NVIDIA Cosmos Pick up the object on the table that is used for drinking water Announcing NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams A Small Human Demonstration Team Can Do the Work of Thousands Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Omniverse Digital Twin Kaohsiung City Omniverse Digital Twin NVIDIA AI Factories, Agents, Robots | Amazing Partners | One Architecture
