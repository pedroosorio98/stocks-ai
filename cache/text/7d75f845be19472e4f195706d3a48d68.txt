Adoption of Fiscal Year 2023 Variable Compensation Plan On&#160;March 3, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Board, of NVIDIA Corporation, or the Company, adopted the Variable Compensation Plan for Fiscal Year 2023, or the 2023 Plan, which provides eligible executive officers the opportunity to earn a variable cash payment based on the level of achievement by the Company of certain corporate performance goals, or the Performance Goals, during fiscal year 2023. The Company operates on a fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in January and designates its fiscal year by the year in which that fiscal year ends. Fiscal year 2023 refers to the Company&#8217;s fiscal year ending January 29, 2023. The Compensation Committee has set the Performance Goals for fiscal year 2023 based upon the achievement of specified fiscal year 2023 revenue and has established threshold, base operating plan, and stretch operating plan levels. An eligible participant&#8217;s variable cash compensation under the 2023 Plan will be based on the achievement by the Company of the Performance Goals in fiscal year 2023. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant must remain an employee through the payment date under the 2023 Plan to be eligible to earn an award. The following table sets forth the respective target award opportunities for base operating plan achievement for the Company&#8217;s named executive officers under the 2023 Plan: Named Executive Officer Target Award Opportunity for Base Operating Plan Achievement Target Award Opportunity for Base Operating Plan Achievement as a % of Fiscal Year 2023 Base Salary Jen-Hsun Huang President and Chief Executive Officer $2,000,000 200% Colette M.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. (a) Amendment to Bylaws On March 3, 2022, the Board amended and restated the Company&#8217;s Bylaws, or the Restated Bylaws, to implement a majority vote standard for the election of directors in uncontested director elections, with a plurality vote standard applying to contested director elections. Under the Restated Bylaws, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted &#8220;for&#8221; a director must exceed the number of votes cast as &#8220;against&#8221; that director. &#8220;Abstentions&#8221; and &#8220;broker non-votes&#8221; with respect to that director&#8217;s election will not be counted as votes cast. Prior to this amendment and restatement, the election of directors was subject to a plurality vote standard, provided that any director nominee who did not receive the necessary votes was required to submit his or her offer of resignation to the Board, which then determined whether to accept or reject such resignation based on all relevant facts and circumstances. These resignation provisions remain unchanged in the Restated Bylaws. The Restated Bylaws became effective immediately upon adoption by the Board. The foregoing description is only a summary of the changes made to the Restated Bylaws and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the Restated Bylaws, which are filed with this report as Exhibit 3.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.
