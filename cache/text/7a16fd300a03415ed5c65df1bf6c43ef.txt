JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) announced that the independent members of the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved the annual compensation for 2025 for Mr. James Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $43,000,000 compared to last year&#8217;s annual compensation of $39,000,000. The annual compensation for 2025 reflects Mr. Dimon&#8217;s stewardship of the Firm, with strong performance across our market-leading businesses and financial results, as well as a fortress balance sheet, and continues to demonstrate strong pay-for-performance alignment. Mr. Dimon&#8217;s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and performance-based variable incentive compensation of $41,500,000. $5,000,000 of the variable incentive compensation will be delivered in cash and the remaining $36,500,000 will be delivered in the form of at-risk Performance Share Units ("PSUs"). PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Dimon&#8217;s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics, representing 88% of his total variable incentive compensation. This significant weighting of pay mix to equity is designed to align with shareholders&#8217; interests by encouraging continued focus on the long-term success of the Firm. The key features of the PSU program are consistent with last year, including the financial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - "ROTCE") with absolute and relative performance goals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as well as clawback and recovery provisions. 2 Under Mr. Dimon's stewardship in 2025, the Firm delivered strong results and maintained its fortress balance sheet principles. Results reflect execution on long-term strategic initiatives, years of investment, a favorable market backdrop, and selective deployment of excess capital. In 2025, the Firm reported record revenue for the eighth-consecutive year of $185.6 billion 1 and net income of $57.0 billion, or $20.02 per share, with ROTCE of 20% representing sustained strong relative outperformance compared to peers. The Firm increased its quarterly common dividend from $1.25 to $1.50 per share. The Firm ended 2025 with a common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) ratio 3 of 14.5%, CET1 capital 3 of $288 billion and $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities 4 , providing it with meaningful capacity to support clients and further invest in its business and communities. During 2025, the Firm raised approximately $3.3 trillion of credit and capital 5 for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which include individuals, homeowners, small and large-sized businesses, schools, hospitals, cities, states, and countries. The Firm continued its investments in data, technology, and AI research and capabilities; people and products; and corporate responsibility, positioning the Firm for future success. Lastly, the Firm opened its new global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue in New York, one of many investments to create collaborative work environments for employees, serve clients locally and globally, and contribute to local economies. The Board evaluated Mr. Dimon&#8217;s holistic performance across financial and non-financial results, as well as the competitive environment, in determining his compensation. As part of their evaluation and determination, the Board considered Mr. Dimon&#8217;s continued development of top executives to lead for today and the future, his continued commitment to shareholders and his longstanding exemplary leadership of a premier financial services firm. 1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Revenue is on a managed basis. Managed revenue and ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures.

In addition, all equity awards granted in 2026 contain recapture provisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the value of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In addition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards granted to the CEO are also subject to additional Protection-based Vesting provisions under which awards may be cancelled as determined by the Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by the Board of Directors. 3 Estimated.
