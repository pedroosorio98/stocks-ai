Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 10 Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. ("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”) On February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20- for-one stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.

Revenue Backlog and Deferred Revenues As of September 30, 2022 , we had $52.4 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily related to Google Cloud, and expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.4 billion was recognized as revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Note 3. Financial Instruments Debt Securities We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 12 For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $779 million as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, the fair value of these debt securities was $4.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.

See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Equity Investments The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities Gains and losses (including impairments) reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and non- marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ (36) $ (73) $ 545 $ (355) Net unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period 2,157 (574) 9,185 (1,613) Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 2,121 $ (647) $ 9,730 $ (1,968) In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 14 Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period. Equity Securities Sold Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Total sale price $ 1,199 $ 296 $ 4,553 $ 1,631 Total initial cost 188 310 955 738 Cumulative net gain (loss)(1) $ 1,011 $ (14) $ 3,598 $ 893 (1) Cumulative net gains for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 excludes cumulative losses of $684 million resulting from our equity derivatives, which hedged the changes in fair value of certain marketable equity securities sold. The associated derivative liabilities arising from these losses were settled against our holdings of the underlying equity securities. Carrying value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities The carrying value is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). The carrying values for marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions): As of December 31, 2021 Marketable Securities Non-Marketable Securities Total Total initial cost $ 4,211 $ 15,135 $ 19,346 Cumulative net gain (loss)(1) 3,587 12,436 16,023 Carrying value(2) $ 7,798 $ 27,571 $ 35,369 (1) Non-marketable equity securities cumulative net gain (loss) is comprised of $14.1 billion gains and $1.7 billion losses (including impairments).

Non-marketable equity securities The following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses (including impairments) recorded in other income (expense), net, which are included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held as of the end of the period (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities $ 1,260 $ 219 $ 6,245 $ 3,234 Unrealized losses on non-marketable equity securities (including impairments) (37) (707) (98) (2,353) Total unrealized gain (loss) recognized on non- marketable equity securities $ 1,223 $ (488) $ 6,147 $ 881 During the three months ended September 30, 2022 , included in the $28.6 billion of non-marketable equity securities held as of the end of the period, $1.7 billion were measured at fair value resulting in a net unrealized loss of $488 million. Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 , equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $ 1.5 billion and $1.3 billion , respectively. Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 16 fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of de-designation. As of September 30, 2022 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $1.9 billion, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Other Derivatives Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains (losses) arising from these derivatives are reflected within the "other" component of other income (expense), net and the offsetting recognized gains (losses) on the marketable equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity securities, net component of other income (expense), net.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 21 Note 4. Variable Interest Entities (VIE) Consolidated VIEs We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements. For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $6.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the "other" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. Unconsolidated VIEs We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2022. Note 5. Debt Short-Term Debt We have a debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. Long-Term Debt Total outstanding debt is summarized below (in millions, except percentages): Maturity Coupon Rate Effective Interest Rate As of December 31, 2021 As of September 30, 2022 Debt 2014-2020 Notes Issuances 2024 - 2060 0.45% - 3.38% 0.57% - 3.38% $ 13,000 $ 13,000 Future finance lease payments, net and other (1) 2,086 2,213 Total debt 15,086 15,213 Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (156) (146) Less: Current portion future finance lease payments, net and other current debt(1)(2) (113) (414) Total long-term debt $ 14,817 $ 14,653 (1) Future finance lease payments are net of imputed interest.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 22 The notes in the table above are fixed-rate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally with each other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semi-annually. The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $12.4 billion and $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 , respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Credit Facility As of September 30, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Note 6.

Contingencies Indemnifications In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of September 30, 2022 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022. On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court rejected our appeal on three claims, accepted our appeal on one claim, and reduced the fine to €4.1 billion. We are preparing to appeal to the European Court of Justice. In the second quarter of 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in the third quarter of 2022. On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ( $1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example: • In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices. • On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 27 deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. The DOJ's investigation of similar issues remains ongoing. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. • On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened a formal investigation into Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations. We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. Other We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and cybersecurity, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. We have ongoing legal matters relating t o Russi a. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 28 We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. Non-Income Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13. Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Stock Split On July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for further details. Share Repurchases In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2022 , $43.5 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. Class A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 138 million and 369 million aggregate shares for $15.4 billion and $43.9 billion , respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended September 30, 2022 , 25 million shares were Class A stock for $2.7 billion and 113 million shares were Class C stock for $12.7 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , 46 million shares were Class A stock for $5.2 billion and 323 million shares were Class C stock for $38.7 billion. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 29 Note 11.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets: • Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription- based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. • Google Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. • Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount. Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors." Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Seasonality and other Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality. Revenues and Monetization Metrics Google Services Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”) as well as revenues from other sources (“Google other revenues”). Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: • Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; • YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and • Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners’ properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity. Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including: • advertiser competition for keywords; Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 34 • changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy; • changes in device mix; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs; • general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including the effect of COVID-19 , geopolitical events, regulations and other measures; • seasonality; and • traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels. Google Other Google other revenues are comprised of the following: • Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store; • Devices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones; • YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and • other products and services. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following: • Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services; • Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and • other enterprise services. Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services. For further details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues. • TAC includes: ◦ Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. ◦ Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties. • Other cost of revenues includes: ◦ Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee). Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 35 ◦ Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs). ◦ Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell ("hardware costs"). The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners. Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative. The main components of our R&D expenses are: • compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services; • depreciation; and • professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services. The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are: • compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and • spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services. The main components of our general and administrative expenses are: • compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions; • expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and • professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. For additional details, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as well as Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Hedging gains contributed approximately one percentage point to consolidated revenue growth. • Total constant currency revenues , which exclude the effect of hedging, increased 11% year over year reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. • Cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in other costs of revenues. • Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, an increase of 26% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses due to headcount growth and advertising and promotional expenses. Other information • On September 12, 2022 we closed the acquisition of Mandiant for a total purchase price of $6.1 billion and added over 2,600 employees . Mandiant's financial results are reported within Google Cloud as of the acquisition date. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. • Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable. • Repurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $15.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. • Operating cash flow was $23.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022. • Capital expenditures of $7.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily relate to investments in technical infrastructure.

The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Growth was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. YouTube ads YouTube ads revenues decreased $134 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 , as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates more than offset growth in our brand and direct response advertising products. YouTube ads revenues increased $1.1 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . The growth was driven by our brand and direct response advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers as well as improvements to ad formats and delivery. Growth was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google Network Google Network revenues decreased $127 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 , as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates more than offset strength in AdSense. Google Network revenues increased $1.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdSense and AdMob, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.

The increase in clicks for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in clicks relating to ads on Google Play. Cost-per-click decreased from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 and increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product changes, and property mix, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Impressions and cost-per-impression The following table presents year-over-year changes in impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2022 Impressions change 3% 5% Cost-per-impression change (5)% 4% Impressions increased from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by growth in Google Ad Manager and AdSense, partially offset by a decline in impressions related to AdMob. The decrease in cost-per-impression from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Impressions increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, driven by growth across Google Ad Manager, AdMob, and AdSense. The increase in cost-per-impression from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google other revenues Google other revenues increased $141 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising followed by growth in hardware revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by an increase in phone sales. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google other revenues increased $388 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising, partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 39 announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues increased $1.9 billion and $5.3 billion from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , respectively.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Cost of revenues increased $12.9 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $9.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The increase in TAC from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners primarily driven by growth in revenues Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 41 subject to TAC. T he increase in TAC from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate increased from 21.6% to 21.7% from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 and increased from 21.7% to 21.8% from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center and other operations costs as well as hardware costs.

Google Services Google Services operating income decreased $4.2 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 . The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses, hardware costs, and advertising and promotional activities, partially offset by growth in revenues. Google Services operating income decreased $391 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses and TAC, partially offset by growth in revenues. Google Cloud Google Cloud operating loss increased $55 million and $279 million from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , respectively. The increase in operating loss was primarily driven by an increase in expenses, primarily driven by compensation expenses, partially offset by growth in revenues. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 43 Other Bets Other Bets operating loss increased $323 million from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 . The increase in operating loss was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses. Other Bets operating loss increased $621 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . The increase in operating loss was primarily driven by increases in compensation expenses, partially offset by growth in revenues. Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents other income (expense), net (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Other income (expense), net $ 2,033 $ (902) $ 9,503 $ (2,501) Other income (expense), net, decreased $2.9 billion from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to changes in gains and losses on equity and debt securities. In the three months ended September 30, 2022 , $731 million of net losses were recognized on debt securities, and $492 million of net unrealized losses were recognized on non-marketable equity securities. These losses were partially offset by interest income recognized of $615 million. In the three months ended September 30, 2021, $2.2 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, partially offset by $492 million of accrued performance fees related to certain investments. Other income (expense), net, decreased $12.0 billion from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due changes in gains and losses on equity securities and performance fees . In the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , $2.5 billion of net unrealized losses were recognized on marketable equity securities and $1.9 billion of net losses were recognized on debt securities. These losses were partially offset by interest income recognized of $1.5 billion and $879 million of net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, $9.2 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, partially offset by $1.7 billion of accrued performance fees related to certain investments.

Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2021 2022 2021 2022 Income before provision for income taxes $ 23,064 $ 16,233 $ 66,332 $ 54,181 Provision for income taxes $ 4,128 $ 2,323 $ 10,941 $ 7,833 Effective tax rate 17.9 % 14.3 % 16.5 % 14.5 % The effective tax rate decreased by 3.6 percentage points from the three months ended September 30, 2021 to the three months ended September 30, 2022 .The decrease was primarily driven by a change in unrecogni zed tax benefits and the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax de duction. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation-related tax benefit. The effective tax rate decreased by 2.0 percentage points from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . The decrease was primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction and a change in unrecognized tax benefits. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation-related tax benefit. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 44 Financial Condition Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of September 30, 2022 , we had $116.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities a re comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders. The following table presents our cash flows (in millions): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 66,718 $ 67,881 Net cash used in investing activities $ (24,507) $ (14,071) Net cash used in financing activities $ (44,851) $ (52,128) Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, for compensation and related costs, and for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include hardware costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to increases in cash received from revenues, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and an increase in tax payments driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and other working capital. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to a net decrease in cash used for purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase of purchases of property and equipment. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt. Net cash used in financing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2021 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock. Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 45 Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: • technical infrastructure, which consists of investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning (collectively referred to as information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and • office facilities, ground up development projects, and related building improvements. Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi- year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, capital expenditures were $18.3 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $8.3 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively. Leases For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $2.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 , the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $16.8 billion . As of September 30, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $4.1 billion, excluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion , respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. Financing We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2022 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of September 30, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities. As of September 30, 2022 , we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our debt. Share Repurchase Program In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of September 30, 2022 , $43.5 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , we repurchased and subsequently retired 138 million and 369 million aggregate shares for $15.4 billion and $43.9 billion , respectively . Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the three months ended September 30, 2022 , 25 million shares were Class A stock for $2.7 billion and 113 million shares were Class C stock for $12.7 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 46 subsequently retired during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , 46 million shares were Class A stock for $5.2 billion and 323 million shares were Class C stock for $38.7 billion. European Commission Fines In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017 ), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 ), and €1.5 billion ( $1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019 ), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court rejected our appeal on three claims, accepted our appeal on one claim, and reduced the fine to €4.1 billion . We are preparing to appeal to the European Court of Justice. In the second quarter of 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in the third quarter of 2022. While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For further details, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Taxes As of September 30, 2022 , we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"). As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have taxes payable of $4.4 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2022. Critical Accounting Estimates See Part II, Item 7, "Critical Accounting Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Available Information Our website is located at www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our Proxy Statements, and any amendments to these reports, are available through our investor relations website, free of charge, after we file them with the SEC. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC's website at www.sec.gov that has all of the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC. We webcast via our investor relations website our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community. Our investor relations website also provides notifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance and other items of interest to our investors, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs. We also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors. Further, corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the heading "Other." The content of our websites are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 47 including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results. In 2019, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning ( ERP) system, which replaced much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely information to our management team. We have now completed implementation of the most significant modules planned to date. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 48 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 9 “Contingencies - Legal Matters” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 , which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our stock. Below are material changes to our risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. A variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business. We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices, have made, and may continue to make, our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business, including, among others: • Laws and regulations around the world focused on large technology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union and proposed antitrust legislation on self-preferencing and mergers and acquisitions in the U.S., which may limit certain business practices, and in some cases, create the risk of significant penalties. • Privacy laws, such as the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, Virginia CDPA, and ColoPA (as defined and discussed further below). • Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data. • Consumer protection laws, including EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations. • New laws further restricting the collection, processing and/or sharing of advertising-related data. Copyright or similar laws around the world, including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) and EU member state transpositions. These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate. The EUCD and similar laws could also increase the liability of some content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. Some of these laws, as well as follow-on administrative or judicial actions, have also created or may create a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to link to, interact with, or present such content. They may also require individual or collective compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers for the use of such content, which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such content provides to Google and its users, potentially harming our services, commercial operations, and business results. • Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country. • Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the United Kingdom’s Age-Appropriate Design Code. • Various laws with regard to content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as Germany's Network Enforcement Act, the European Union's Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072 and Texas' House Bill 20, which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant litigation, damage claims, and fines if they are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices and policies, or if we remove or promote (or fail to remove or promote) content in ways inconsistent with those laws. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 49 • Various legislative, litigation, and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model, which could result in monetary penalties, damages and/or prohibition. • Various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may make it easier for websites to artificially promote low-quality, deceptive, or harmful content on services like Google Search and YouTube, potentially harming the quality of our services. In addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example: • We rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in both the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v. Google) and EU that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms. • Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the ‘right to be forgotten,’ which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens. The introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions we take have subjected us, and will likely continue to subject us, to additional laws and regulations. Our investment in a variety of new fields, such as healthcare and payment services, has expanded, and will continue to expand, the scope of regulations that apply to our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. ITEM 2.

OTHER INFORMATION Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose if we or any of our affiliates knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with entities or individuals designat ed pursuant to certain Executive Orders. The U.S. government has designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the “FSB”) pursuant to one of those Executive Orders, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has accordingly updated General License No. 1B (the “OFAC General License”), which generally permits U.S. persons to engage in transactions and activities prohibited by the relevant Executive Order involving the FSB that are necessary and ordinarily incident to requesting, receiving, utilizing, paying for or dealing in licenses, permits, certifications, or notifications issued or registered by the FSB for the importation, distribution, or use of information technology products in Russia. In the past year and during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet, filed notifications with the FSB as required pursuant to Russian encryption product import controls for the purpose of enabling the import of certain software in Russia. Neither we nor our subsidiaries generated any gross revenues or net profits directly from such approval activity and neither we nor our subsidiaries sell to the FSB . Alphabet expects that Google LLC will continue to file these notifications as required under Russia law. Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. 51 ITEM 6.
