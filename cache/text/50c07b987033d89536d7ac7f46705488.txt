The noncontrolling interest is related to the restricted exchangeable partnership units of Broadcom Cayman L.P. (“Partnership REUs”), of which Broadcom Limited is the General Partner. (2) For the fiscal quarter and two fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2016, diluted loss per share numerators and denominators include the impact of the noncontrolling interest, which assumes conversion of Partnership REUs to Broadcom ordinary shares. The diluted loss per share calculations include 23 million and 11 million Partnership REUs for the fiscal quarter and two fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2016, respectively, representing an assumed conversion of 100% of the Partnership REUs under the “if converted” method.
