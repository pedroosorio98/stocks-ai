In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. There are no reclassifications associated with FR managed revenue 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. ROTCE ex. FR uses the same average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $100.30, $98.11 and $87.00 at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense of $665mm, $420mm and $47mm for the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. There was no legal expense excluded from FR adjusted expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 12 Additional notes 1. Reflects the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") capital transition provisions. Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9B CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining $1.4B CECL benefit; as of September 30, 2022, CET1 capital reflected a $2.2B benefit. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023 and on pages 86-96 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable securities, includes end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR. Also includes other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023 and on pages 97-104 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information 3.

Basel 3 Endgame Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“B3E NPR”) 2. Global Systemically Important Banks (“GSIB”) 3. Estimate for operational risk losses calculated as follows: Federal Reserve nine-quarter operational risk losses of $185B for all CCAR banks allocated pro-rata based on total assets and adjusted for a 50% haircut to reflect timing of peak stress occurring prior to the end of nine quarters. Applying this to JPM: $185B x 17% x 50% = ~$15B 4. Based on 2.9% current Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) and $500B RWA increase, the translation to an updated SCB requirement under the B3E regime would put JPMorgan below the 2.5% floor, resulting in an effective increase in the dollars of SCB 5. Reflects CET1 based on estimated 3Q23 Standardized RWA with a 2.9% SCB and 4.5% GSIB Slide 5 – The “19%” quoted by the Agencies does not tell the full story 1. 19% capital increase for Category I and II bank holding companies, as stated in the B3E NPR 2. Assumes flat balance sheet based on estimated 3Q23 Standardized RWA 3. Based on 2017 rule set the firm had an effective GSIB surcharge of 3.5% and a Capital Conservation Buffer (“CCB”) of 2.5% 4. Current Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA-CCR”) impact is assumed to be 50% of the Day 1 adoption impact which we reported as a 1Q22 Standardized RWA increase of $40B; and current SCB 2.9% vs. CCB of 2.5% 5. Estimated impacts from the GSIB Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”) based on our best understanding of the proposal. The impact incorporates the benefit of a higher B3E RWA on the short-term wholesale funding (“STWF”) component of the GSIB surcharge 6.
