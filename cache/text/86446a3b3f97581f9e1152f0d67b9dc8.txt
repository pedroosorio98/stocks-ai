Card loans were up 16% with continued strong new account originations. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, we generated strong Markets revenue, up 15% as we helped clients navigate volatile market conditions. Global IB fees were down 54% compared to a record last year, in a challenging macro environment. Commercial Banking loans were up 7% on strong new loan originations and higher revolver utilization. Asset & Wealth Management delivered solid results as the impact of higher rates and loan and deposit balances more than offset the decline in market levels.” “In our global economy, we are dealing with two conflicting factors, operating on different timetables. The U.S. economy continues to grow and both the job market and consumer spending, and their ability to spend, remain healthy. But geopolitical tension, high inflation, waning consumer confidence, the uncertainty about how high rates have to go and the never-before-seen quantitative tightening and their effects on global liquidity, combined with the war in Ukraine and its harmful effect on global energy and food prices are very likely to have negative consequences on the global economy sometime down the road. We are prepared for whatever happens and will continue to serve clients even in the toughest of times.” “In the first half of 2022, we extended credit and raised $1.4 trillion in capital for large and small businesses, governments and U.S. consumers. We continue to invest in strengthening the Firm by adding products, people and technology to better serve our customers, as well as expand into new markets. We will continue to use our capital to invest in and grow our market-leading businesses to support our clients, customers and communities and pay a sustainable dividend.” Dimon concluded: “As a result of the recent stress tests and the already scheduled G- SIB increase, we will build capital and continue to effectively and actively manage our RWA. In order to quickly meet the higher requirements, we have temporarily suspended share buybacks which will allow us maximum flexibility to best serve our customers, clients and community through a broad range of economic environments.” CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.0 billion, or $1 per share n $224 million of common stock net repurchases in 2Q225 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $86.38, up 2%; tangible book value per share 2 of $69.53, up 1% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 3 of $207 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 12.2%; Advanced ratio3 of 12.8% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.3% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 2Q22 expense of $18.7 billion; reported overhead ratio of 61%; managed overhead ratio2 of 59% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $1.4 trillion of credit and capital9 raised YTD n $138 billion of credit for consumers n $16 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $553 billion of credit for corporations n $609 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $36 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the second quarter of 2022 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue was $31.6 billion, up 1%. Net interest income (NII) was $15.2 billion, up 19%. NII excluding Markets 2 was $13.7 billion, up 26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. Noninterest revenue was $16.4 billion, down 12%, predominantly driven by lower Investment Banking fees and lower Card income in CCB, partially offset by higher CIB Markets revenue. The decrease also reflects a loss in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB compared to a gain in the prior year, $337 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions in the bridge book10, and net losses on equity investments. Noninterest expense was $18.7 billion , up 6%, driven by continued investments in the business, including technology and marketing, and higher structural expense, primarily compensation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, including $657 million of net charge-offs and a net reserve build of $428 million, primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook. Net charge-offs of $657 million were down $77 million driven by Card. The net reserve build in the current quarter included $238 million in Wholesale, and $184 million in Consumer. The prior year provision was a net benefit of $2.3 billion, reflecting a net reserve release of $3.0 billion and $734 million of net charge-offs. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was $12.6 billion, down 1%. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $6.6 billion , up 9%, predominantly driven by growth in deposits. Home Lending net revenue was $1.0 billion, down 26%, predominantly driven by lower production revenue from lower margins and volume, and lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads, partially offset by higher net mortgage servicing revenue. Card & Auto net revenue was $5.1 billion , down 6%, predominantly driven by strong new Card account originations leading to higher acquisition costs, and lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by higher Card net interest income on higher revolving balances. Noninterest expense was $7.7 billion , up 9%, reflecting higher investments in the business and structural expense, predominantly driven by compensation, technology, and marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense, primarily due to auto lease depreciation. The provision for credit losses was $761 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $611 million, and a $150 million reserve build in Card driven by loan growth. Net charge-offs were down $121 million driven by Card. The prior year provision reflected a $2.6 billion reserve release across CCB. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 86.38, $86.16 and $ 84.85 at June 30, 2022 , March 31, 2022 , and June 30, 2021 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2021 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
