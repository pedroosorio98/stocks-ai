JPMORGAN CHASE REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER 2010 NET INCOME OF $4.8 BILLION, OR $1.09 PER SHARE, ON REVENUE1 OF $25.6 BILLION INCLUDES BENEFIT FROM REDUCTION IN LOAN LOSS RESERVES ($0.36 PER SHARE) AND CHARGE FOR U.K. BONUS TAX ($0.14 PER SHARE)  Quarterly profits up from prior year and prior quarter: - Solid performance across most businesses combined with reduced credit costs - Retail Financial Services and Card Serv ices net charge-offs and delinquencies improved from the prior quarter - Strong balance sheet: Tier 1 Common 1 at $108.2 billion, or 9.6%; credit reserves at $36.7 billion; loan loss coverage ratio at 5.3% of total loans1  Continued support for economic recovery through assisting customers, sound lending and efforts to prevent foreclosure: - Nearly $700 billion in new and renewed credit provided to and capital raised for consumers, corporations, small businesses, municipalities and non-profits during the first half of the year - Small-business originations up 37% during the first half of the year - 880,000 modifications offered and 245,000 approved since the beginning of 2009 New York, July 15, 2010 – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported second-quarter 2010 net income of $4.8 billion, compared wi th $2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Earnings per share were $1.09, compared with $0.28 in the second quarter of 2009. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter: “Our net income increased to $4.8 billion, including the benefit from a $1.5 billion reduc tion of loan loss reserves – which we do not believe represents normal ongoi ng earnings – partially offset by a charge of $550 million for the U.K. bonus tax.” Continuing on the businesses, Dimon added: “Alt hough we are gratified to see consumer-lending net charge-offs and delinquencies decline, they remain at extremely high levels and therefore returns in our consumer-lending businesses are still unacceptable. As a result, these businesses did not meet expectations nor genera te satisfactory returns on capital for our shareholders. It is too early to say how much improvement we will see from here. “We saw solid performance in our other busine sses. In particular, our wholesale businesses experienced reduced net charge-offs that led to reductions in loan loss reserves, and are currently seeing credit costs which reflect the increasingly healthy condition of our wholesale clients.” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Commenting on the strength of the balance sheet, Dimon said: “We maintained very high liquidity, with a deposit-to-loan ratio of 127%, and generated additional cap ital, ending the quarter with a strong Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.6%. Total firmwide credit re serves fell to $36.7 billion, as loan balances remained flat and credit costs declined, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 5.3% of total loans1. Our strong and growing capital base has enabled us to buy back over $500 million of stock to date, and we will continue to do so opportunistically.” Dimon further remarked: “We continue to aggr essively do all that we can reasonably and responsibly to contribute to the eco nomic recovery. During the first ha lf of the year, we loaned or raised capital for our clients of nearly $700 billi on, and our small-business originations were up 37%.” Looking ahead, Dimon concluded: “We recognize a number of positive aspects of the pending regulatory refor m legislation, including systemic risk oversight and resolution authority. However, many challenges and uncertainties remain which may result in unintended consequences for our clients, the markets and our businesses. With a need for global regula tory coordination and hundreds of rules to be written, incr eased focus is critical in order to implement these reforms in a way that protects consumers and the competitivene ss of the U.S. financial system, while ensuring the flow of safe and sound credit. As always, a nd regardless of uncertai nties about the credit environment and pending regulation, we remain committed to the long-term growth of our franchise. We continue to invest in our infrastructure to enable us to deliver the quality products and services that our customers demand, and to provide good returns for our shareholders.” In the discussion below of the business se gments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm , information is presented on a managed basis.

These results reflected lower revenue and higher noninterest expense, predominan tly offset by a benefit from the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $6.3 billion, compared with $7.3 billion in the prior y ear. Investment banking fees decreased by 37% to $1.4 billion, consisti ng of equity underwriting fees of $354 million (down 68%), debt underwriting fees of $696 milli on (down 6%) and advisory fees of $355 million (down 10%). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.6 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in the prior year. The decrease largely reflected lower re sults in credit markets, rates and commodities. Equity Markets revenue was $1.0 billion, compared w ith $708 million in the prior year, reflecting solid client revenue. Credit Portfolio revenue wa s $326 million, primarily re flecting net interest income and fees on retained loans. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $325 million, compared with an expense of $871 million in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely related to net repayments and loan sales. The allowance for loan losses to end- of-period loans retained was 3.98% , compared with 7.91% in the pr ior year. The d ecline in the allowance ratio was due largely to the consolidation of asset-backed commercial paper conduits in accordance with new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2010. Excluding these balances, the current-quarter allowance coverage ra tio was 6.49%. Net charge-offs were $28 million, compared with $433 million in the prior year . Nonperforming loans were $2.3 billion, down by $1.3 billion from the prior year and $481 million from the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $4.5 billion, compared with $4.1 billion in the prior year. Current-quarter results included the impact of the U.K. bonus tax.

The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $2.1 billion from the prior year and $2.0 billion from the prior quarter. Although losses for the mortgage and home equity portfolios continued to be extremely high, the current-qua rter provision reflected improved delinquency trends and reduced net charge-offs as compared to prior periods. Additionally, the prior-year and prior-quarter provisions included additions to the allowance for loan losses of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Home equity net ch arge-offs were $796 million (3.32% net charge-off rate 1), compared with $1.3 billio n (4.61% net charge-off rate 1) in the prior year.

Retail Banking net charge-offs were $168 million (4.04% net charge-off rate), compared with $211 million (4.70% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 3% compared with the prior year, resulting from sales force increases. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Mortgage Banking & Ot her Consumer Lending reported net income of $364 million, an increase of $129 million, or 55%, from the prio r year. The increase was driven by higher noninterest revenue and a lower provision for cred it losses, partially offs et by higher noninterest expense.

(*) Presented on a managed basis. Effective January 1, 2010, the JPMorgan Chase adopt ed new accounting guidance that required t he Firm to consolidate its Firm-sponsored credit card s ecuritization trusts. As a result, reported and managed basis are equivalent for pe riods beginning after January 1, 2010. See notes on page 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $25,101 mi llion, $27,671 million and $25,623 million for the second quarter of 2010, first quarter of 2010 and second quarter of 2009, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $4.8 billion, up by $2.1 billion, or 76%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by a significant ly lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $25.6 billion, a decrease of $2.1 bill ion, or 8%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $12.8 billion, down modestly from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower principal transactions revenue, reflecting lower trading results, and lower investment banking fees, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 partially offset by higher securi ties gains. Net interest inco me was $12.8 billion, down by $1.9 billion, or 13%, largely driven by lower loan balances. The provision for credit losses was $3.4 billi on, down by $6.3 billion, or 65% , from the prior-year provision. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 5.34%, compared with 5.01% in the prior year. Th e total consumer provision for credit losses was $3.9 billion, compared with $8.5 billion, reflecting a re duction in the allowance for credit losses as a result of improved delinquency trends and re duced net charge-offs. Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $5.5 billion, compared with $7.0 billi on, resulting in net charge-off rates of 5.34% and 6.18%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a be nefit of $572 million, compared with an expense of $1.2 billion, reflecti ng a reduction in the allowance for credit losses mainly due to net repayments, loan sales, refine ments to credit loss estimates, and improvement in the credit quality of the comme rcial and industrial portfolio. W holesale net charge-offs were $231 million, compared with $679 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.44% and 1.19%, respectively. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $18.2 billion at June 30, 2010, up from the prior-year level of $17.5 billion and down from the prior-quarter level of $19.0 billion. Noninterest expense was $14.6 billion, up by $1.1 billi on, or 8%. Current-quarter results included the impact of the U.K. bonus tax and higher litigation expense.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s re sults on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of th e lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financ ial measure. The Firm’s defin ition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain recla ssifications to present total ne t revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and invest ments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxabl e and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Prior to January 1, 2010, the Firm’s managed-basis presentation also included certain reclassification adjustments that assumed credit card loans securitized by CS remained on the balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance that amended the accounting for the transfer of financial assets and the cons olidation of VIEs. A dditionally, the new guidance required the Firm to consolidate its Firm-sponsored credit card securitizations trusts. The income, expense and credit costs associated with these securitization activities are now recorded in the 2010 Conso lidated Statements of Income in the same classifications that were previously used to report such items on a managed basis. As a result of the consolidation of the cred it card securitization trusts, reported and managed basis relating to credit card securitizations are comparable for periods begin ning after January 1, 2010. The presentation in 2009 of CS results on a managed basis assumed th at credit card loans that had been securitized and sold in accordance with U.S. GAAP remained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and that the earnings on the securitized loans were classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained lo ans recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. JPMorgan Chase used the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations were funded and decisions were made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based on managed financial inform ation. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and securitized loans. Although securitiza tions result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing custom er relationships, as the custom ers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance af fects both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. JPMorgan Chase believed that th is managed-basis information wa s useful to investors, as it enabled them to understand both the credit ri sks associated with the loans reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. b. The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired loans; the allowa nce for loan losses related to purchased credit-impaired loans; and, loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of purchased credit-impair ed loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the purchased credit-impaired portfolio was $2.8 billion at both June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010. No allowance for loan losses was recorded at June 30, 2009 related to these loans. c. Tier 1 Common Capital (“Tier 1 Co mmon”) is defined as Tier 1 Capital less elements of capital not in the form of common equity – such as qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifyi ng noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 Common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is us ed by banking regulat ors, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of th e Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 Common along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. e. TSS firmwide revenue includes certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business – mainl y CB, RFS and AM – related to customers who are also customers of those lines of business. f. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, whic h is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all co sts are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Excluding this reduction, the adjusted ROE and ROTCE for the second quarter 2009 would have been 6% and 10%, respectively. The Firm views the adjusted ROE and ROTCE, both non-GAAP financial measures, as meaningful because they enable the comparability to prior periods. (c) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (d) The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the Firm's use of equity and to f acilitate comparisons with competitors. For further discussion of ROTCE, see page 42 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (e) Tier 1 common capital ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by risk-weighted assets. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital a long with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of Tier 1 common capital ratio, see page 42 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (f) Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new guidance that amended the accounting for the transfer of financial assets and the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Upon adoption of the new guidance, the Firm consolidated its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts, Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and certain other consumer loan securitization entities, primarily mortgage-related, adding $87.7 billion and $92.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, and decreasing stockholders’ equity and the Tier I capital ratio by $4.5 billion and 34 basis points, respectively. The reduction to stockholders’ equity was driven by the establishment of an allowance for loan losses of $7.5 billion (pretax) primarily related to receivables held in credit card securitization trusts that were consolidated at the adoption date. For further details regarding the Firm's application and impact of the new accounting guidance, see Note 14 on pages 130-131, Note 15 on pages 131-142 and Note 22 on pages 149-152 of JPMorgan Chase's March 31, 2010, Form 10-Q.
