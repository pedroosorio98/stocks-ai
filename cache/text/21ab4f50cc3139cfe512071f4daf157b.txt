These forward-looking statements and any other forward-looking statements that go beyond historical facts that are made in this presentation are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners' products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences and demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems and other factors. NVIDIA has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely upon the forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The future events and trends discussed in this presentation may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Although NVIDIA believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the company cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. For a complete discussion of factors that could materially affect our financial results and operations, please refer to the reports we file from time to time with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

Financial Measures In addition to U.S. GAAP financials, this presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. See the Appendix for a reconciliation between each non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure. • Financials • Board of Directors and Governance • Corporate Sustainability Summary 74.0% 75.1% 74.6% Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 GAAP P&L $ in millions, except EPS Gross Margin %Revenue Operating Income Diluted EPS* $18,120 $30,040 $35,082 Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 +17% QoQ +94% YoY -50bps QoQ +60bps YoY $10,417 $18,642 $21,869 Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 +17% QoQ +110% YoY $0.37 $0.67 $0.78 Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 +16% QoQ +111% YoY *All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split, which was effective June 7, 2024. 75.0% 75.7% 75.0% Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 $11,557 $19,937 $23,276 Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 $0.40 $0.68 $0.81 Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 Non-GAAP P&L $ in millions, except EPS Gross Margin %Revenue Operating Income Diluted EPS* -70bps QoQ Flat YoY +17% QoQ +101% YoY +19% QoQ +103% YoY +17% QoQ +94% YoY $18,120 $30,040 $35,082 Q3 FY24 Q2 FY25 Q3 FY25 *All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split, which was effective June 7, 2024.
