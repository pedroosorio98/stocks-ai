In the CIB, clients were active, with IB fees up 49%, and Markets revenue rose 21%. Additionally, Payments fees grew by double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, helping drive Payments revenue to a record $18.1 billion for the year. In CCB, we continued to acquire new customers across Consumer Banking, Business Banking, Card and wealth management. For example, nearly 2 million net new checking accounts were opened during 2024. Finally, in AWM, management fees rose 21%, and revenue hit a record $5.8 billion. More impressively, client asset net inflows totaled $486 billion in 2024, bringing cumulative net inflows over the past two years to $976 billion.” Dimon added: “Regarding regulation, we have consistently said that regulation should be designed to effectively balance promoting economic growth and maintaining a safe and sound banking system. It is possible to achieve both goals. This is not about weakening regulation — we maintain a fortress balance sheet, evidenced by $547 billion of total loss-absorbing capacity and $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities — but rather about setting rules that are transparent, fair, holistic in their approach and based on rigorous data analysis, so that banks can play their critical role in the economy and markets.” Dimon added: “The U.S. economy has been resilient. Unemployment remains relatively low, and consumer spending stayed healthy, including during the holiday season. Businesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro- growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business. However, two significant risks remain. Ongoing and future spending requirements will likely be inflationary, and therefore, inflation may persist for some time. Additionally, geopolitical conditions remain the most dangerous and complicated since World War II. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.” Dimon concluded: “I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication are what set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, which include consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.” CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.5 billion or $1.25 per share n $4.0 billion of common stock net repurchases10 n Net payout LTM10,11 of 54% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $116.07, up 11%; tangible book value per share2 of $97.30, up 13% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $276 billion, Standardized ratio3 of 15.7% and Advanced ratio3 of 15.8% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.1% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n Approximately $2.8 trillion of credit and capital12 raised in 2024: n $250 billion of credit for consumers n $40 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $2.4 trillion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $65 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons are for the fourth quarter of 2024 versus the prior-year fourth quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue was $43.7 billion , up 10%. Net interest income was $23.5 billion , down 3%. Noninterest revenue was $20.3 billion, up 29%. Net interest income excluding Markets 2 was $23.0 billion, down 2%, driven by lower rates and deposit margin compression across the lines of business, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was largely offset by the impact of balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment, as well as higher revolving balances in Card Services and higher wholesale deposit balances. Noninterest revenue excluding Markets 2 was $13.7 billion, up 30%, largely driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher investment banking fees and lower net investment securities losses compared to the prior year. Markets revenue was $7.0 billion, up 21%. Noninterest expense was $22.8 billion , down 7%. Excluding the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment in the prior year, noninterest expense was up 5%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including growth in front office and technology employees, as well as higher brokerage expense and distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was $ 2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve build of $267 million. Net charge-offs of $2.4 billion were up $200 million, primarily driven by Card Services. The net reserve build included a $572 million net build in Consumer, predominantly in Card Services, and a $282 million net release in Wholesale. The prior-year provision was $2.8 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $598 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue 13 was $18.4 billion, up 1%. Banking & Wealth Management net revenue was $10.2 billion, down 7%, driven by lower net interest income on deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances, partially offset by higher asset management fees in J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion , up 12%, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.9 billion, up 14%, driven by Card Services, reflecting higher net interest income on higher revolving balances and higher card income on higher sales volume.

The provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion and a net reserve build of $557 million. Net charge-offs of $2.1 billion were up $428 million, driven by Card Services, primarily due to the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years and balance growth. The net reserve build was predominantly in Card Services, driven by growth in revolving balances, partially offset by changes in certain macroeconomic variables. The prior-year provision was $2.2 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.6 billion and a net reserve build of $551 million. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year- to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax- exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $116.07, $115.15 and $104.45 at December 31, 2024 , September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K. d. Full-year 2024 results included the impact of significant items. These items collectively refer to a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares, a $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation, $546 million of net investment securities losses and a $725 million increase to the estimated FDIC special assessment, all of which were previously disclosed in the first and second quarters of 2024. Full-year 2024 revenue, net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $7.3 billion to reported revenue from $177.6 billion to $170.2 billion, a decrease of $7.3 billion to managed revenue from $180.6 billion to $173.3 billion, a decrease of $4.5 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $58.5 billion to $54.0 billion, a decrease of $1.53 per share to reported EPS from $19.75 to $18.22 and a decrease of 2ppts to reported ROTCE from 22% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
