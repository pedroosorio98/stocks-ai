Shareholders are provided an opportunity to ask questions about topics of importance to the Firm&#8217;s business and affairs, to consider matters described in the proxy statement and to receive an update on the Firm&#8217;s activities and performance. We hope that you will participate in the meeting. We encourage you&#160;to designate the persons named as proxies on the proxy card to vote your shares even if you are planning to attend. This will ensure that your common stock is represented at the&#160;meeting. This proxy statement explains more about the matters to be voted on at the annual meeting, about proxy voting, and other information about how to participate. Please read it carefully. We look forward to your participation. Sincerely, James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Table of Contents A letter from Stephen B. Burke, our Lead Independent Director April&#160;7, 2025 Dear fellow shareholders, As we approach the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, I am writing to share some thoughts as your Lead Independent Director. It is an honor to hold this position and a responsibility I take very seriously. In this role I serve with a dedicated group of fellow directors who work closely with senior management to grow the company and advance the interest of shareholders. We are fortunate to have a great management team led by our Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon. For two decades, Jamie and his team have delivered excellent results while supporting our clients, communities and employees. Our Board meets at least eight times a year and has broad and unfettered access to dozens of senior managers. Over the course of many years, we have come to know the executive team and the culture they operate in well. The Board works cooperatively with senior management, and also challenges them to constantly improve operations and deliver results for shareholders. Building on investments and decisions made over many years, your company continued its record financial performance in 2024. We grew across all of our market-leading lines of business, achieved record financial results and continued to invest for the future. Our managed revenue of $180.6 billion was a record for the seventh consecutive year. Our net income of $58.5 billion was also a record and we had a return on equity of 18% and return on tangible common equity of 22%. The Firm announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $1.05 a share to $1.25 in December 2024 and to $1.40 in March 2025. The Board is focused on many factors which contribute to long-term performance. We have strong committee leadership that is engaged across all aspects of the business. We are particularly engaged with the uncertainty and opportunity presented by a challenging geopolitical environment. The Board works closely with senior management to make sure that the Firm has the resiliency and capital strength to be able to help our clients in both good times and bad times. One of the Board&#8217;s key responsibilities is to plan for an orderly and successful CEO transition. As discussed in detail in the proxy statement, the entire Board is involved with developing and assessing the senior executives who are potential CEO candidates. In January 2025, the Firm announced that Daniel Pinto, our President and Chief Operating Officer, is expected to retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak has moved from the Commercial &amp; Investment Bank to become our new Chief Operating Officer. Doug Petno has succeeded Jenn as co-CEO of the Commercial &amp; Investment Bank, partnering with Troy Rohrbaugh. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes continue as CEOs of Consumer &amp; Community Banking and Asset &amp; Wealth Management, respectively. The Board believes these management changes will help the Firm better serve its clients and further develop these senior leaders. In addition, the Board believes the Firm has a very strong and deep bench of senior leaders who have grown up in a culture that emphasizes doing the right things to ensure long-term success. The Board recognizes its role is different than that of senior management. While senior management runs the company, the Board performs a broad and strong oversight function, making sure that senior management maintains an open and collaborative culture, challenging management when appropriate, asking tough questions and making sure that the Firm is positioned well for the future. At present the Board is particularly focused on issues such as geopolitical uncertainty, the role of artificial intelligence and the evolving regulatory environment. The Firm&#8217;s approach to risk management, liquidity, capital, cybersecurity, the economy and other issues are discussed regularly at our Board meetings. We also work closely with management to promote equal treatment, opportunity and access throughout our organization. We remain committed to maintaining a vital and engaged Board for today and in the future. This year we were fortunate to identify two new directors, each of whom we are pleased to nominate for election by shareholders at the annual meeting. Brad Smith is the President of Marshall University and was CEO of Intuit for eleven years. Michele Buck is Chairman, President and CEO of The Hershey Company. Both Brad and Michele bring experience managing large, complex, international organizations Table of Contents through periods of change and innovation. Their impressive combination of skills, experiences and personal qualities will serve our shareholders, the Firm and our Board well in the years ahead. Our Board is committed to working diligently on behalf of our shareholders. We are driven to help senior management deliver results by, as J.P. Morgan himself put it, &#8220;doing first-class business in a first-class way.&#8221; On behalf of the entire Board, we thank you for your support and remain committed to serving the best interests of our shareholders. Sincerely, Stephen B. Burke Lead Independent Director Table of Contents Notice of 2025 annual meeting of shareholders and&#160;proxy statement Date Tuesday, May 20, 2025 Access The 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held in a virtual meeting format, via the Internet.

We believe shareholders should consider three key factors in their evaluation of this year&#8217;s proposal: 1. How we think about pay decisions The Firm&#8217;s Business Principles and strategic framework form the basis of our OC members&#8217; strategic priorities. The Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee (&#8220;CMDC&#8221;) references those strategic priorities and the Firm&#8217;s compensation philosophy to assess OC members&#8217; performance and to determine their respective total compensation levels and pay mix. 2. How we performed against our business strategy We continued to deliver strong multi-year financial performance, invest in our future, strengthen our risk and control environment, and reinforce our culture and values, including our long-standing commitment to serve our customers, employees and communities, and conduct business in a responsible way to drive economic growth. 3. How performance determined pay in 2024 In determining OC member pay, the CMDC took into account performance across four broad performance dimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls &amp; Conduct; Client/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork &amp; Leadership. CEO pay is strongly aligned to the Firm&#8217;s short-, medium- and long-term performance, with approximately 87% of the CEO&#8217;s variable pay deferred into equity, of which 100% is in at-risk Performance Share Units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) for both our current CEO and President &amp; COO. Other NEO pay is also strongly aligned to Firm and line of business (&#8220;LOB&#8221;) performance, with a majority of variable pay deferred into equity, of which 50% is in at-risk PSUs. Disciplined performance assessment process to determine pay The CMDC uses a balanced holistic approach to determine annual compensation, which includes a disciplined assessment of performance against the aforementioned four broad dimensions over a sustained period of time. The table below summarizes the salary and incentive compensation awarded to our NEOs for 2024 performance.

To be considered independent, a director must have no disqualifying relationships, as defined by the NYSE, and the Board must have affirmatively determined that he or she has no material relationships with JPMorganChase, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of another organization that has a relationship with the Firm.

These may include, among other relationships: extensions of credit; provision of other financial and financial advisory products and services; business transactions for property or services; and charitable contributions made by the JPMorgan Chase Foundation or the Firm to a nonprofit organization of which a director is an officer. The Board reviews these relationships to assess their materiality and determine if any such relationship would impair the independence and judgment of the relevant director.

He became Mr. Burke&#8217;s son-in-law in 2024. He has been employed by the Firm since 2021 and is currently a Business Relationship Manager in Consumer &amp; Community Banking. The Board, having reviewed the relevant relationships between the Firm and each non-management director, determined, in accordance with the NYSE&#8217;s listing standards and the Firm&#8217;s independence standards, that each non-management director (Linda B. Bammann, Michele G. Buck, Stephen&#160;B.&#160;Burke, Todd A. Combs, Alicia Boler Davis, Alex Gorsky, Mellody Hobson, Phebe N. Novakovic, Virginia M. Rometty, Brad D. Smith, and Mark A. Weinberger) had only immaterial relationships with JPMorganChase and accordingly is independent. Timothy P. Flynn and Michael A. Neal, each of whom retired in May 2024, had only immaterial relationships with JPMorganChase and accordingly were independent directors. All directors who served on the Audit and Compensation &amp; Management Development Committees of the Board were also determined to meet the additional independence and qualitative criteria of the NYSE listing standards applicable to directors serving on those committees.

BOARD REVIEWS ITS NEEDS CANDIDATE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT The Board considers its composition and needs holistically, determining the diversity of experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and viewpoints required to effectively oversee the Firm, including its present and future strategy. The Governance Committee solicits candidate recommendations from shareholders, directors, and management and, from time to time, has been assisted by a third-party advisor in identifying qualified candidates. The Governance Committee considers the following in evaluating prospective directors, among other items: &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s Governance Principles &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s strategy, risk profile and current Board composition &#8226; Candidate&#8217;s specific skills and experiences based on the needs of the&#160;Firm &#8226; Candidate&#8217;s contribution to Board diversity in experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and&#160;viewpoints &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; FULL BOARD CONSIDERATION CANDIDATE MEETINGS The Governance Committee puts the candidate forward for consideration by the full&#160;Board. The potential nominee meets with the Governance Committee, Lead Independent Director, Chair of the Board, other members of the Board and senior management, as appropriate. The Governance Committee is engaged in an ongoing recruitment process designed to build a strong pipeline of prospective directors for the near and long-term. This includes candidates who are not available for board membership immediately but may become available in the future, such as candidates whose current professional commitments preclude board service and emerging leaders who require more experience. Often the Board works to develop a relationship with prospective candidates, becoming familiar with their skills and effectiveness, before the candidate is formally considered. The Board looks to recruit those who will contribute individually, and it seeks to balance skills, experience, personal attributes and&#160;tenure. All candidates recommended to the Governance Committee are evaluated based on the same standards outlined above. The Firm&#8217;s By-laws provide for a right of proxy access. Our By-laws enable shareholders, under specified conditions, to include their nominees for election as directors in the Firm&#8217;s proxy statement. Under these provisions, a shareholder group of up to 20 shareholders who have continuously owned at least 3% of the Firm&#8217;s outstanding shares for at least three years may nominate up to 20% of the Board (but in any event at least two directors).

Smith and Michele G. Buck to the Board effective January&#160;21, 2025 and March 17, 2025, respectively. The Board used the process described on the previous page and took into account the considerations outlined on pages 9 - 11 and shareholder interest in board refreshment. Mr. Smith and Ms. Buck have been among a select group of individuals considered as part of the Governance Committee&#8217;s evaluation of prospective Board members in recent years. Mr. Smith and Ms. Buck were familiar to a number of directors and executives based on their leadership roles at Intuit Inc. and The Hershey Company, respectively. Members of the Governance Committee suggested that they be considered as prospective candidates. Members of the Governance Committee met with them, as did Mr. Dimon and other Board members. Upon review of their qualifications and independence, the Governance Committee recommended their election by the Board. For more information on Mr. Smith and Ms. Buck's qualifications, see page 17 and page 13 , respectively. Director re-nomination The Governance Committee also oversees the re-nomination process. In determining whether to re-nominate a director for election at our annual meeting, the Governance Committee reviews each director, considering: Retirement policy Our Governance Principles require a non-management director to offer not to stand for re-election in each calendar year following a year in which the director will be 75 or older. The Board (other than the affected director) then determines whether to accept the offer. The Board has increased the retirement age from 72 to 75 to better align with peer financial institutions and to potentially expand the pool of director candidates. The Board believes that the appropriate mix of experience and fresh perspectives is an important consideration in assessing Board composition, and the best interests of the Firm are served by taking advantage of all available talent, and evaluations as to director candidacy should not be determined solely on age. None of our director nominees will be 75 or older this year. For a description of the annual Board and committee self-assessment process, see page 26 . 20 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Board governance &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Corporate governance Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement 02 Board governance Strong governance practices Our Board is guided by the Firm&#8217;s Governance Principles, and we adhere to the Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles and the Investor Stewardship Group&#8217;s Corporate Governance Principles for U.S. Listed Companies. Our sound governance practices include: Annual election of all directors by majority vote 100% principal standing committee independence Robust shareholder engagement process, including participation by our Lead Independent Director and semi-annual Board review of investor feedback Ongoing consideration of Board composition and refreshment and annual review of board leadership structure Lead Independent Director with an independent perspective and judgment as well as clearly-defined responsibilities Limits on directors&#8217; board and audit committee memberships Executive sessions of independent directors at each&#160;regular Board meeting without the presence of&#160;the CEO Direct Board access to, and regular interaction with,&#160;management Annual Board and committee self-assessment guided by Lead Independent Director and review of progress on key action items throughout the year Strong director attendance: each director attended 75% or more of total meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served during 2024 No poison pill Robust anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies Ongoing director education Stock ownership requirements for directors Our Board&#8217;s leadership structure The Board&#8217;s leadership structure is designed to promote Board effectiveness and to appropriately allocate authority and responsibility between the Board and management. Based on consideration of the factors described on page 22 , our Board has determined that combining the roles of Chair and CEO is the most effective leadership structure for the Board at this time. The Board believes the present structure provides the Firm and the Board with strong leadership, appropriate independent oversight of management, continuity of experience that complements ongoing Board refreshment, and the ability to communicate the Firm&#8217;s business and strategy to shareholders, clients, employees, regulators and the public in a single voice. As required by the Firm&#8217;s Governance Principles, when the role of the Chair is combined with that of the CEO, the independent directors appoint a Lead Independent Director. Our Lead Independent Director provides a strong counterbalance to the Chair, including facilitating independent oversight of management, promoting open dialogue among the independent directors during and in between Board meetings, leading executive sessions at each regular Board meeting without the presence of the CEO, and focusing on the Board&#8217;s priorities and processes. In March 2025, the independent directors conducted their annual review of the Board&#8217;s leadership structure. This review was conducted first by the Governance Committee, which considered the factors on page 22 , the Firm&#8217;s governance practices, which include executive sessions of independent directors as part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting and the directors&#8217; frequent and open interactions with senior management, and the effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director role. Following its review, the Governance Committee recommended that the Board continue its current leadership structure and that Stephen B. Burke be re-appointed as Lead Independent Director. The independent directors of the Board then conducted their own review, again taking into account the factors on page 22 , the Governance Committee&#8217;s recommendation and Mr.&#160;Burke&#8217;s strong performance in the Lead Independent Director role over the course of the prior year, and determined to maintain the current leadership structure with Mr. Burke serving as Lead Independent Director. The Board maintains the ability to change its leadership structure at any time should it elect to do so and is not limited to its annual review of leadership structure. The Board has a general policy, upon the next CEO transition, that the Chair and CEO positions shall be separate, subject to the Board&#8217;s determination of the leadership structure that best serves the Firm and its shareholders at that time. This policy is reflected in the Firm&#8217;s Governance Principles and reinforces the Board&#8217;s longstanding commitment to independent oversight while also maintaining the Board&#8217;s ability to fulfill its fiduciary duty to determine the leadership structure that best serves shareholders. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 21 Table of Contents Corporate governance &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Board governance Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement Factors the Board considers in reviewing its leadership structure The Board reviews its leadership structure not less than annually, and conducted its most recent review in March 2025, considering the following factors: &#8226; The respective responsibilities for the positions of Chair and Lead Independent Director (see table below for detailed&#160;information) &#8226; The people currently in the roles of Chair and Lead Independent Director and their record of strong leadership and performance in their roles &#8226; The current composition of the Board &#8226; The policies and practices in place to provide independent Board oversight of management (including Board oversight of CEO performance and compensation, regular executive sessions of the independent directors, Board input into agendas and meeting materials, and Board self-assessment) &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s circumstances, including its financial performance &#8226; The views of our stakeholders, including shareholders &#8226; Trends in corporate governance, including practices at other public companies, and studies on the impact of leadership structures on shareholder value &#8226; Such other factors as the Board determines Respective duties and responsibilities of the chair and lead independent director Chair Calls Board and shareholder meetings Presides at Board and shareholder meetings Approves Board meeting schedules, agendas and materials, subject to the approval of the Lead Independent Director Lead Independent Director Has the authority to call for a Board meeting or a meeting of independent directors Presides at Board meetings in the Chair&#8217;s absence or when otherwise appropriate Approves agendas and adds agenda items for Board meetings and meetings of independent&#160;directors Acts as liaison between independent directors and the Chair/CEO Presides over executive sessions of independent directors Engages and consults with major shareholders and other constituencies, where appropriate Provides advice and guidance to the CEO on executing long-term strategy Guides the annual performance review of the Chair/CEO Advises the CEO of the Board&#8217;s needs and expectations Guides annual independent director consideration of CEO compensation Meets one-on-one with the Chair/CEO following executive sessions of independent directors Guides the Board in its consideration of CEO succession Guides the annual self-assessment of the Board 22 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Board governance &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Corporate governance Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement Board meetings and attendance 8 Regularly scheduled Board meetings Communication between meetings as appropriate 8 Executive sessions of independent directors Led by Lead Independent Director 41 Meetings of principal standing committees 8 Meetings of specific purpose committees 2 Special Board meetings The Board conducts its business as a whole and through a well-developed committee structure in adherence to our Governance Principles. The Board has established practices and processes to actively manage its information flow, set meeting agendas and promote sound, well-informed decisions. Board members have direct access to management and regularly receive information from, and engage with, management during and outside of formal Board meetings. In addition, the Board and each committee has the authority and resources to seek legal or other expert advice from sources independent of management. The full Board met 10 times at eight regularly scheduled Board meetings and two special Board meetings in 2024. For more information on committees, see below. Each director attended 75% or more of the total meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served in 2024. Committees of the Board A significant portion of our Board&#8217;s oversight responsibilities is carried out through its five independent, principal standing committees: Audit Committee, CMDC, Governance Committee, Public Responsibility Committee (&#8220;PRC&#8221;) and Risk Committee. Allocating responsibilities among committees allows more in-depth attention devoted to the Board&#8217;s oversight of the business and affairs of the Firm. Committees meet regularly in conjunction with scheduled Board meetings and hold additional meetings as needed. Each committee reviews reports from senior management and reports its actions to, and discusses its recommendations with, the full Board. Each principal standing committee operates pursuant to a written charter. These charters are available on our website at jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-committees. Each charter is reviewed at least annually as part&#160;of the Board&#8217;s and each respective committee&#8217;s self-assessment. The Board annually reviews the allocation of responsibility among the committees as part of the Board and committee self- assessment. For more information about the self-assessment process, see page&#160; 26 . Each committee has oversight of specific activities and risk, and engages with the Firm&#8217;s senior management responsible for those areas. All committee chairs are appointed at least annually by our Board. Committee chairs are responsible for: &#8226; Calling meetings of their committees &#8226; Approving agendas for their committee meetings &#8226; Presiding at meetings of their committees &#8226; Serving as a liaison between committee members and the Board, and between committee members and senior management, including the CEO &#8226; Working directly with the senior management responsible for committee mandates The Board has determined each member of the Audit Committee (Michele G. Buck, Alex Gorsky, Phebe N. Novakovic and Mark A. Weinberger) to be an audit committee financial expert in accordance with the definition established by the SEC, and that Ms. Bammann, the chair of the Risk Committee, has experience in identifying, assessing and managing risk exposures of large, complex financial firms in accordance with rules issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 23 Table of Contents Corporate governance &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Board governance Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement Key oversight responsibilities of the principal standing committees of the Board Board of directors Audit Oversees: 15 meetings in 2024 &#8226; The independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s qualifications and independence &#8226; The performance of the internal audit function and the independent public accounting firm &#8226; Management&#8217;s responsibilities to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed&#160;to: &#8212; Safeguard the assets and income of the Firm &#8212; Ensure integrity of financial statements &#8212; Maintain compliance with the Firm&#8217;s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations &#8226; Internal control framework &#8226; Reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of&#160;responsibility CMDC Oversees: 6 meetings in 2024 &#8226; Development of and succession for key executives &#8226; Compensation principles and practices &#8226; Compensation and qualified benefit programs &#8226; Operating Committee performance assessments and compensation &#8226; Culture and significant employee conduct issues and any related actions &#8226; Reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility Governance Oversees: 8 meetings in 2024 &#8226; Review of the qualifications of proposed nominees for Board membership &#8226; Corporate governance practices applicable to the&#160;Firm &#8226; The framework for the Board&#8217;s self-assessment &#8226; Shareholder engagement &#8226; Board and committee composition &#8226; Reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility Risk Oversees: 8 meetings in 2024 &#8226; Management&#8217;s responsibility to implement an effective global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm&#8217;s risks, including: &#8212; Strategic risk &#8212; Market risk &#8212; Credit and investment risk &#8212; Operational risk &#8226; Applicable primary risk management policies &#8226; Risk appetite results and breaches &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s capital and liquidity planning and&#160;analysis &#8226; Reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility PRC Oversees: 4 meetings in 2024 &#8226; Community investing and fair lending practices &#8226; Political contributions, major lobbying priorities and principal trade association memberships related to public policy &#8226; Sustainability &#8226; Consumer practices, including consumer experience, consumer complaint resolution and consumer issues related to disclosures, fees or the introduction of major new products &#8226; Reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility For more information about committee responsibilities, see committee Charters available at: jpmorganchase.com/about/ governance/board-committees. 24 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Board governance &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Corporate governance Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement Other standing committees The Board has two additional standing committees: Stock Committee: The committee is responsible for implementing the declaration of dividends, authorizing the issuance of stock, administering the dividend reinvestment plan and implementing share repurchase plans.

Executive Committee: The committee may exercise all the powers of the Board that lawfully may be delegated, but with the expectation that it will not take material actions absent special circumstances. The Board may establish additional standing committees as&#160;needed. Specific purpose committees The Board establishes specific purpose committees as appropriate to address specific issues. The Board currently has two such committees, the Markets Compliance Committee and the Omnibus Committee. The Markets Compliance Committee provides oversight in connection with certain markets-related matters, including issues related to trading venues and trade surveillance data feeds. The Omnibus Committee reviews matters delegated by the&#160;Board. As the Firm achieves its objectives in a specific area, the work of the relevant specific purpose committee will be concluded and the committee appropriately disbanded. Additional Specific Purpose Committees may be established from time to time in the future to address particular issues.

Through this practice, which includes an assessment of its policies, procedures and performance, the Board identifies areas for further consideration and improvement. In assessing itself, the Board takes a multi-year perspective. The Board self-assessment is guided by the Lead Independent Director and is conducted in phases. SELF-ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK The Governance Committee reviews and provides feedback on the annual self-assessment process. &#160; BOARD AND COMMITTEE ASSESSMENTS The Board reviews the actions taken in response to the previous year&#8217;s self-assessment and reviews the Board&#8217;s performance against regulatory requirements, including its responsibilities under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency&#8217;s &#8220;Heightened Standards&#8221; for large national banks, as well as the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Supervisory Guidance on Board of Directors&#8217; Effectiveness. Topics addressed in the Board assessment generally include: strategic priorities; Board composition and structure; how the Board spends its time; oversight of and interaction with management; oversight of culture &amp; conduct; talent management and succession planning; committee effectiveness; and specific matters that may be relevant. Each principal standing committee conducts a self-assessment that includes a review of performance against committee charter requirements and focuses on committee agenda planning and the flow of information received from management. Committee discussion topics include committee composition and effectiveness, leadership, and the content and quality of meeting materials. &#160; ONE-ON-ONE DISCUSSIONS The directors hold private individual discussions with the General Counsel using a discussion guide that frames the self-assessment. The General Counsel and Lead Independent Director review feedback from the individual discussions. &#160; ACTION ITEMS The General Counsel and Lead Independent Director report the feedback received to the Board. Appropriate action plans are developed to address the feedback received from the Board and committee assessments. Throughout the year, the Board and committees partner with management to execute and evaluate progress on action&#160;items. 26 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Board governance &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Corporate governance Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement Director education Our director education program focuses on incorporating key strategic and important cross-business issues and is designed to assist Board members in fulfilling their responsibilities. The director education program commences with an orientation program when a new director joins the Board. Ongoing education for all directors is conducted throughout the year through &#8220;deep dive&#8221; presentations from LOBs, discussions and presentations by subject matter experts and other events. In 2024, directors participated in programs on a number of subjects, including: &#8226; deep dive sessions from each LOB covering topics such as products, services, strategy and control environment; &#8226; finance deep dives; &#8226; geopolitical updates; &#8226; governance and disclosures related to Firm and ESG commitments; &#8226; key laws, regulations and supervisory requirements applicable to the Firm; &#8226; significant and emerging risks; &#8226; technology, AI and cybersecurity updates; and &#8226; workforce matters, including diversity and inclusion. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 27 Table of Contents Corporate governance &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Board oversight Director nominees &#160; Board governance &#160; Board oversight &#160; Engagement 03 Board oversight The Board is responsible for oversight of the business and affairs of the Firm on behalf of shareholders. It is also responsible for setting the cultural &#8220;tone at the top.&#8221; Among its core responsibilities, the Board oversees: Strategy The Board of Directors oversees the formulation and implementation of the Firm&#8217;s strategic initiatives and reviews and approves the Firm&#8217;s annual strategic plan. Annual strategic plans include evaluation&#160;of performance against the prior year&#8217;s initiatives, assessment of the current operating environment, refinement of existing strategies and development of&#160;new strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, the CEO and senior management&#160;provide updates on the Firm&#8217;s overall strategic direction, including updates on the opportunities and performance, priorities and implementation of strategies in their respective LOBs and Corporate functions. These management presentations are the foundation of active dialogue with, and feedback from, the Board about the strategic risks and opportunities facing the Firm and its businesses. Executive performance, talent management and succession planning The CMDC reviews the Firm&#8217;s performance periodically during the course of the year, and formally, at least annually. The&#160;CMDC&#8217;s review of the CEO&#8217;s performance&#160;is presented to the Board in connection with the Board&#8217;s review of executive officer annual&#160;compensation. In accordance with our Governance Principles, succession planning is considered at least annually by the Board. The CMDC reviews the succession plan for the CEO in preparation for discussion by the Board, with such discussion guided by the Lead Independent Director. These discussions occur with and without the CEO and include consideration of recommendations, evaluations and development plans for potential CEO successors, in addition to ongoing review of the Firm&#8217;s long-term strategy and analyses of CEO transitions at other companies, among other factors. The Board is focused on enabling an orderly CEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of succession planning, the Board continues to oversee management&#8217;s development of several Operating Committee members who are well-known to shareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr.&#160;Dimon. As part of this, individual OC members have been provided with opportunities to gain exposure to different parts of the business and to deepen their leadership experience in new and expanded roles. In January 2025, the Firm announced that Daniel Pinto, President and Chief Operating Officer, is expected to retire at the end of 2026. He will relinquish his responsibilities as President and COO as of June 30, 2025 and is expected to continue to serve as Vice Chairman through the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak has become Chief Operating Officer. Doug Petno, Co-head of Global Banking, succeeded Ms. Piepszak as Co-CEO of the CIB, partnering with Troy Rohrbaugh, who continues as Co-CEO of the CIB. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes continue as CEO of Consumer &amp; Community Banking and CEO of Asset &amp; Wealth Management, respectively. The Board believes that these senior management changes will help the Firm better serve its clients as well as further develop the Firm&#8217;s most senior leaders. The CMDC also periodically reviews the succession plan for members of the OC other than the CEO to build a robust talent pipeline for specific critical&#160;roles. The Board has numerous&#160;opportunities to meet with, and assess development plans for, members of the OC and other high-potential senior management leaders. This occurs through various means, including informal meetings, presentations to the Board and its committees, and Board dinners.

Reports on the Firm&#8217;s financial performance and condition are presented at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Firm&#8217;s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) capital plan submission, which contains the Firm&#8217;s proposed plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments, stock repurchases and other capital actions, is reviewed and approved prior to its submission to the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight of the Firm&#8217;s financial statements and internal control framework. The Audit Committee also assists the Board in the appointment, retention, compensation, evaluation and oversight of the Firm&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm. For further information, see &#8220;Risk management and internal control framework&#8221; below. Risk management and internal control&#160;framework Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase&#8217;s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale&#160;loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm&#8217;s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm&#8217;s risk governance framework is managed on a firmwide basis. The Board of Directors oversees management&#8217;s strategic decisions, and the Risk Committee oversees Independent Risk Management (&#8220;IRM&#8221;) and the Firm&#8217;s risk governance framework. Cybersecurity risk is overseen by the full Board, with additional oversight of the relevant risk framework and controls provided by the Audit and Risk Committees. Board committees support the Board&#8217;s oversight responsibility by overseeing the risk categories related to such committee&#8217;s specific area of focus. Committee chairs report significant matters discussed at committee meetings to the full Board. Issues escalated&#160;to the full Board may be dealt with in several ways, as appropriate, for example: oversight of risk may remain with the particular principal standing committee of the Board,&#160;the Board may establish or direct a specific purpose committee to oversee&#160;such matters, or the Board may ask management to present more frequently to the full Board on the issue. Environmental, social and governance matters Oversight of ESG-related matters is part of the Board&#8217;s work in setting the policies and principles that govern our business,&#160;including: &#8226; the Firm&#8217;s governance-related policies and practices; &#8226; our systems of risk management and controls; &#8226; our investment in our employees; &#8226; the manner in which we serve our customers and support our communities; and &#8226; how we advance sustainability in our business and&#160;operations. Board committees each consider ESG-related matters within their scope of responsibility. The PRC provides oversight of the Firm&#8217;s positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending, consumer practices, sustainability and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm&#8217;s values and character and impact its reputation among its stakeholders. The CMDC oversees the Firm&#8217;s culture, including reviewing employee-related diversity programs; the Risk Committee considers climate risk; the Governance Committee reviews board composition and also considers shareholder proposals; and the Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of compliance with the Firm&#8217;s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. In the past year, Board and committee discussion topics included, among others, sustainability, Diversity, Opportunity &amp; Inclusion ("DOI"), Racial Equity Commitment, and governance of ESG initiatives. In the second half of 2025, we intend to release a consolidated report on ESG and climate topics. In recent years, we published an annual ESG Report, which provided information on how we are addressing the ESG-related matters that we and our stakeholders view as important to our business. Additionally, we published a Climate Report, which included disclosure about the Firm&#8217;s approach to climate-related risks and opportunities. In 2024, our ESG-related disclosures were informed by the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures as applicable. We continue to monitor the evolving disclosure landscape as we iterate on our approach to disclosure.

In addition to discussions at Board meetings with&#160;senior management about these efforts, our directors&#160;participate in events outside of the boardroom including meetings with employees that emphasize this commitment. These meetings include LOB and leadership team events such as our annual senior leaders&#8217; meetings and informal sessions with members of the OC and other senior leaders. In&#160;2024, members of our Board participated in Regional Director dinners, Firmwide senior leadership events, LOB industry events and Business Resource Groups&#8217; (&#8220;BRGs&#8221;) events. Regulators Our Board and senior leaders regularly meet with regulators. These interactions help&#160;us learn first-hand from regulators about matters of importance to them and their expectations of us. They also provide a forum for the Board and management to keep our regulators well-informed about the Firm&#8217;s performance and business&#160;practices. Stakeholders As we strive to deliver value, management engages with our stakeholders, including our customers, suppliers and leaders in the communities in which we work, on a range of issues and in a variety of ways. These may include, for example, participation in consumer advisory groups and meetings with policy advocacy groups and nonprofit organizations. We actively seek feedback on key topics to help us better understand what is important to our stakeholders and find ways to deliver value while also navigating financial, legal and regulatory considerations. In recent years, we have engaged in extensive stakeholder outreach&#160;pertaining to, among other topics, the Firm&#8217;s enterprise risk management&#160;framework, human capital management and sustainability. Management shares feedback from these relationships and engagements with the Board, providing the Board with valuable insights. Board members also participate in engagements with stakeholders through client events, industry conferences, and shareholder discussions as&#160;appropriate. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 31 Table of Contents Corporate governance &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Director compensation Director compensation The Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing director compensation and making recommendations&#160;to the Board. In making its recommendations, the Governance Committee annually reviews the Board&#8217;s responsibilities and the compensation practices of&#160;peer firms, which include the primary financial services peer group referenced with respect to the compensation of our NEOs. For more information see &#8220;Evaluating market practices&#8221; on page 46 . The Board believes a best practice is to link director compensation to the Firm&#8217;s performance; therefore, a significant portion of director compensation is paid in common stock. Annual compensation For 2024, each non-employee director was entitled to receive an annual cash retainer of up to $110,000 and, if the non-employee director was on the Board at the time when annual performance year equity awards were granted, an annual grant of deferred stock units valued at $265,000. Compensation paid during 2024, including additional cash compensation paid for certain committee and other service, is described in the following tables. Each deferred stock unit included in the annual grant to directors represents the right to receive one share of the Firm&#8217;s common stock and dividend equivalents payable&#160;in deferred stock units for any dividends paid. Deferred stock units have no voting rights. In January of the year immediately following a director&#8217;s retirement from the Board, deferred stock units are distributed in shares of the Firm&#8217;s common stock in either a lump sum or in annual installments for up to 15 years as elected by the director. The following table summarizes the 2024 annual compensation for non-employee directors for service on the Boards of the Firm, the Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (&#8220;JPMS plc&#8221;). There is no additional compensation paid for service on the Board of&#160;IHC.

Stock ownership: no sales, no hedging, no pledging As stated in the Governance Principles, each director retains all shares of the Firm&#8217;s common stock he or she purchased on the open market or received pursuant to his or her service as a Board member for as long as he or she serves on our Board absent any exceptions discussed by the Governance Committee. In addition, shares held personally by a director may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged as collateral, nor may the economic risk of such shares be hedged. Further information on the Firm&#8217;s &#8220;Anti-hedging/anti-pledging provisions&#8221; can be found on page 50 . Deferred compensation Each year, non-employee directors may elect to defer all or part of their cash compensation. A director&#8217;s right to receive future payments under any deferred compensation arrangement is an unsecured claim against JPMorganChase&#8217;s general assets. Cash amounts may be deferred into various investment equivalents, including deferred stock units. Upon retirement from the Board, compensation deferred into stock units will be distributed in stock; all other deferred cash compensation will be distributed in cash. Deferred compensation will be distributed in either&#160;a lump sum or in annual installments for up to 15 years as elected by the director commencing in January of the year following the director&#8217;s retirement from the Board. Reimbursements and insurance The Firm reimburses directors for their expenses in connection with their Board service or pays such expenses directly.

The transactions&#160;covered by the Related Persons Policy include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship in which the Firm is a participant, and the related person has or will have a direct&#160;or indirect material interest. After becoming aware of any transaction which may be subject to the Related Persons Policy, the director or executive officer involved in such transaction is required to report all relevant facts with respect to the transaction&#160;to the General Counsel of the Firm. Upon determination by the General Counsel that a transaction requires review under the Related Persons Policy, the material facts of the transaction&#160;and the related person&#8217;s interest in the transaction are provided to the Governance Committee. The transaction&#160;is then reviewed by the disinterested members of the Governance Committee, who determine whether approval or ratification of the transaction shall be granted. In reviewing a transaction, the Governance Committee considers facts and circumstances that it deems relevant to its determination, such as: management&#8217;s assessment of the commercial reasonableness of the transaction;&#160;the materiality of the related person&#8217;s direct or indirect interest in the transaction; whether the transaction may involve an actual, or the appearance of, a conflict of interest; and, if the transaction involves a director, the impact of the transaction on the director&#8217;s independence. Certain types of transactions are pre-approved in accordance with the terms of the Related Persons Policy. These include transactions in the ordinary course of business involving financial products and services provided by, or to, the Firm, including loans, provided such transactions are in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Federal Reserve Board Regulation O and other applicable laws and regulations.

However, the Compensation &amp; Management Development Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 38 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Compensation discussion and analysis &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation Compensation discussion and analysis Introduction Our compensation philosophy promotes a fair and well-governed, long-term approach to compensation, including pay-for-performance practices that are designed to attract and retain top talent from all backgrounds, to be responsive to and aligned with shareholders, to mitigate excessive risk-taking, and to encourage a culture that supports our Purpose, Values, Business Principles and strategic framework. The Board believes that JPMorganChase&#8217;s long-term success as a premier financial services firm depends in large measure on the&#160;talents of our employees and a proper alignment of their compensation with performance and sustained shareholder value. The&#160;Firm&#8217;s compensation programs play a significant role in our ability to attract, retain and properly motivate a highly talented&#160;workforce. 2024 Performance and annual compensation determination for the CEO In assessing Mr. Dimon&#8217;s performance in the context of the Firm&#8217;s 2024 business results, the CMDC recognized the Firm&#8217;s continued focus on serving our clients and customers against a dynamic global backdrop characterized by ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, while investing in and executing on long-term strategic initiatives. The Firm experienced growth across all of our market-leading lines of business, achieved record financial results and maintained a fortress balance&#160;sheet. The CMDC recognized that the Firm achieved managed revenue 1 of $180.6 billion, which was a record for the seventh consecutive year, as well as record net income of $58.5 billion, or $19.75 per share, with ROTCE 1 of 22%. The Firm increased its quarterly common dividend from $1.05 to $1.25 per share. As part of their evaluation and determination, the Board considered Mr. Dimon's continued development of top executives to lead for today and the future, his continued commitment to shareholders and his longstanding exemplary leadership of the Firm. In light of the continued absolute and relative strength of the Firm&#8217;s performance, the Board determined Mr. Dimon&#8217;s annual pay of $39&#160;million. Succession planning and recent leadership changes One of the Board&#8217;s top priorities is succession planning for Mr. Dimon, which is focused on enabling an orderly CEO transition to take place in the medium-term. As part of succession planning, the Board continues to oversee management&#8217;s development of several Operating Committee members who are well-known to shareholders as strong potential candidates to succeed Mr.&#160;Dimon. Individual OC members have been provided with opportunities to gain exposure to different parts of the business and to deepen their leadership experience in new and expanded roles. Most recently, in January 2025, the Firm announced that Daniel Pinto, President and Chief Operating Officer, is expected to retire at the end of 2026; Jennifer Piepszak was named Chief Operating Officer; and Doug Petno, Co-head of Global Banking, succeeded Ms. Piepszak as Co-CEO of the Commercial &amp; Investment Bank, partnering with Troy Rohrbaugh who continues as Co-CEO of the Commercial &amp; Investment Bank. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes continue as CEO of Consumer &amp; Community Banking and CEO of Asset &amp; Wealth Management, respectively. For further information, see page 28 . Shareholder engagement We highly value engaging with our shareholders and have a demonstrable history of being responsive to their feedback. We&#160;engage extensively each year, and shareholder feedback continues to inform our Board and CMDC in their decisions. The Firm&#160;received 91% support for the 2024 Say on Pay proposal, and shareholders expressed their continued deep support for&#160;the management team, the Firm&#8217;s strategy, long-term performance and pay-for-performance compensation program and&#160;practices. In the discussion that follows, we review the philosophy, key features and process of our executive compensation program as well as how our Board and CMDC make pay decisions. This CD&amp;A is organized around the following factors: &#8226; Compensation discussion and analysis (&#8220;CD&amp;A&#8221;) overview (pages 39 - 42 ) &#8226; How we think about pay decisions (pages 43 - 52 ) &#8226; How we performed against our business strategy (pages 53 - 56 ) &#8226; How performance determined pay in 2024 (pages 57 - 62 ) 1 The Firm reviews the results of the Firm on a managed basis. Managed Revenue and ROTCE are each non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Notes 1 and 2 on page 100 for a further discussion of these&#160;measures. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 39 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Compensation discussion and analysis CD&amp;A overview 01 How we think about pay decisions Pages 43 - 52 Evaluating performance The Firm&#8217;s Business Principles and strategic framework guide our OC members in determining their annual strategic priorities. The CMDC assesses OC members&#8217; performance against those strategic priorities, as well as four broad financial and non-financial performance dimensions in a balanced and holistic way in accordance with the Firm&#8217;s compensation philosophy. To&#160;determine OC compensation, the CMDC&#160;considers both what progress has been made against long-term strategic priorities, and how that progress has been achieved. The CMDC applies: &#8226; ~50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business results ( what they have accomplished) &#8226; ~50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls &amp; conduct; client/customer/stakeholder; and teamwork &amp; leadership ( how they have accomplished results) While there is no single performance dimension in isolation that determines compensation, a significant shortcoming in any one dimension may result in downward adjustments to OC members&#8217; variable compensation, without limits. FOUR BROAD PERFORMANCE DIMENSIONS The "what" The "how&#8221; Business Results &#160; + Risk, Controls &amp; Conduct &#160; + Client/Customer/ Stakeholder &#160; + Teamwork &amp; Leadership &#160; = OC Member Performance Unlimited downward potential for significant shortcomings Determining total compensation After considering OC members&#8217; performance throughout the year and over the long-term, the CMDC first determines their respective total compensation levels and then their pay mix &#8212; a combination of fixed pay (salary) and variable pay (cash&#160;awards and long-term equity). Pay mix is weighted toward long-term equity, and for PSUs, ROTCE performance drives the ultimate payout. The CMDC also considers competitive market practices, referencing our primary financial services peer group of American Express, Bank&#160;of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Pay mix To determine the appropriate pay mix, the CMDC considers the fixed and variable components of each OC member&#8217;s pay. The&#160;salary portion of total compensation has already been paid, and the variable portion can include a cash award that is paid immediately, plus long-term equity in the form of restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and at-risk PSUs. Mr. Dimon receives all of his equity in at-risk PSUs, comprising ~87% of his variable compensation, which is a higher proportion than any of our peer firms&#8217; CEOs. Mr. Dimon&#8217;s total cash compensation is consistently among the lowest, and in 2024, well below the $10 million median of the total cash amounts paid to peer CEOs. The chart below illustrates the components of our OC members&#8217; 2024 pay mix.

The CMDC references those strategic priorities and the Firm&#8217;s compensation philosophy to assess OC members&#8217; performance and determine their respective total compensation levels and pay mix. Business Principles In addition to our Purpose and Values, the Firm&#8217;s Business Principles and culture are fundamental to our success in how we do business over the long-term. Exceptional Client Service Operational Excellence A Commitment to Integrity, Fairness and Responsibility A Great Team and Winning Culture Strategic Framework Guided by our Business Principles, our strategic framework provides holistic direction for the Firm and ultimately focuses on four primary strategic tenets listed below. Each year, the Operating Committee reviews the strategic framework, which is approved by the Board. In 2024, the CMDC approved the Firm&#8217;s strategic framework as the priorities of the CEO and the President, including the 15 strategic priorities listed&#160;below. Exceptional Client Franchises &#8226; Customer centric and easy to do business&#160;with &#8226; Comprehensive set of products and services &#8226; Focus on safety and security &#8226; Powerful brands Unwavering Principles &#8226; Fortress balance sheet &#8226; Risk governance and controls &#8226; Culture and conduct &#8226; Operational resilience Long-Term Shareholder Value &#8226; Continuously investing in the future while maintaining expense discipline &#8226; Focus on customer experience and innovation &#8226; Employer of choice for top talent from all backgrounds Sustainable Business Practices &#8226; Investing in and supporting our communities &#8226; Integrating environmental sustainability into business and operating decisions &#8226; Serving a diverse customer base &#8226; Promoting sound governance Our businesses develop initiatives that map to the strategic framework and are designed to reinforce the Firm&#8217;s operating principles to be complete, global, diversified and at scale. Execution of our strategy forms the basis of what we achieve through our current and multi-year business results. Compensation Philosophy Also guided by our Business Principles, the Firm's compensation philosophy is fundamental to our goals of attracting, retaining and motivating our workforce in a competitive market. Our compensation philosophy provides the guiding principles that drive compensation-related decisions. The key tenets of our compensation philosophy are listed below. Paying for performance and&#160;aligning with shareholders&#8217; interests Encouraging a&#160;culture&#160;of&#160;shared success Attracting and retaining top&#160;talent&#160;from all backgrounds Integrating risk management&#160;and compensation No special perquisites and&#160;non-performance based&#160;compensation Maintaining strong governance Transparency with shareholders &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 43 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Compensation discussion and analysis How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Our pay practices and governance process Our pay-for-performance compensation program is designed to align the long-term interests of our employees with those of our shareholders by emphasizing sustained value and reinforcing personal accountability. Highlighted below are pay practices that are integral to our compensation program, as well as certain pay practices that we choose not to implement. WE ADOPT SOUND PAY PRACTICES &#160; &#160; Principles-based compensation philosophy &#8211; Guiding principles that drive compensation-related decision- making &#160;&#160; Competitive benchmarking &#8211; We evaluate pay levels and pay practices against relevant market&#160;data &#160;&#160; Robust anti-hedging/anti-pledging provisions &#8211; Strict&#160;prohibition on unvested awards and shares owned outright &#160; &#160; Responsible use of equity &#8211; We used less than 1% of weighted average diluted shares in 2024 for employee compensation &#160;&#160; Strong clawback provisions &#8211; Enable us to cancel, reduce or require repayment, if appropriate &#160; &#160; Risk, controls and conduct factors &#8211; We consider material issues as part of performance and pay decisions when appropriate &#160; &#160; Majority of variable pay is in deferred equity &#8211; Most of OC annual variable compensation is deferred in PSUs and RSUs &#160;&#160; Strong share holding requirements &#8211; OC members required to retain significant portion of net shares to increase ownership &#160;&#160; Performance-based pay &#8211; OC variable pay is based on performance linked to shareholder value and safety &amp;&#160;soundness &#160;&#160; Robust shareholder engagement &#8211; Each year the Board receives feedback on our compensation programs and practices &#160; &#160;No new special awards for the current CEO and President &#160;&#160; Direct performance conditions for any rare future special awards to NEOs WE AVOID POOR PAY PRACTICES &#160;&#160; No golden parachute agreements &#8211; We do not provide additional payments or benefits as a result of a change-in-control event &#160;&#160; No guaranteed bonuses &#8211; We do not provide guaranteed bonuses, except for select individuals at&#160;hire &#160; &#160; No special severance &#8211; We do not provide special severance. All employees, including OC members, participate at the same level of severance, based on years of service, capped&#160;at 52 weeks with a maximum credited salary &#160;&#160; No special executive benefits &#8226; No private club dues or excessive tax gross-ups for&#160;benefits &#8226; No 401(k) Savings Plan matching contribution &#8226; No special health or medical benefits &#8226; No special pension credits GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CMDC The CMDC oversees our compensation programs throughout the year, which enables the Committee to be proactive in its compensation planning to address&#160;both current and emerging developments or challenges. Key committee responsibilities related to compensation programs&#160;include: &#8226; Periodically reviewing and approving a statement of the Firm&#8217;s compensation philosophy, principles and practices &#8226; Reviewing the Firm&#8217;s compensation practices and&#160;the relationship among risk, risk management and compensation (including safety and soundness and avoiding practices that could encourage excessive risk-taking) &#8226; Adopting pay practices and approving any necessary formulas, performance metrics or pool calculations in compliance with applicable U.S. and global regulatory, statutory or governance requirements &#8226; Reviewing and approving overall incentive compensation pools (including equity/cash mix) &#8226; Reviewing over multiple meetings and approving compensation for our OC and, for the CEO, making a compensation recommendation to the Board for consideration and ratification by the independent directors &#8226; Reviewing and approving the design and terms of compensation awards, including recovery/clawback provisions The CMDC may delegate authority to the Head of Human Resources ("HR") or other appropriate officer to administer and amend the Firm&#8217;s compensation and benefits programs. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deductibility of executive compensation paid to each of our "covered employees" to $1 million. The CMDC continues to retain the discretion to make awards and pay amounts that may not qualify as tax deductible. 44 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Compensation discussion and analysis &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Our performance assessment process starts with planning and priority-setting The CMDC uses a disciplined pay-for-performance framework to make decisions about the compensation of our OC members, so that their compensation is commensurate with the overall performance of the Firm, their respective businesses and their individual performance. The performance assessment process starts with strategic plans, budgets and priorities being established at those same levels, with the Board and CMDC engaging in regular discussions with the CEO and the Head of HR about individual OC members&#8217; performance throughout the year, as appropriate. This approach (rather than determining pay levels during a single year-end process) enables the CMDC to make balanced and informed OC member pay decisions that are aligned with long-term performance against four broad dimensions, which consider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive sustained shareholder value. Balanced and holistic approach for assessing performance In determining OC compensation, the CMDC considers both what progress has been made against long-term strategic priorities, and how that progress has been achieved. For example, consistently strong revenue, net income and ROTCE performance over the long-term are more important than any short-term fluctuations in business results. The CMDC applies an approximately 50% weighting to its consideration of absolute and relative business results against the Firm&#8217;s strategic priorities over multiple years, i.e., the "what,&#8221; and an approximately 50% weighting to its qualitative consideration of risk, controls &amp; conduct, client/customer/stakeholder and teamwork &amp; leadership, i.e., the "how.&#8221; No single performance dimension in isolation determines total compensation; however, it is possible for a single significant shortcoming in any performance dimension to have a downward impact on variable compensation without limitation. The&#160;CMDC has historically exercised this kind of downward discretion by making significant reductions to OC member compensation related to risk &amp; control matters &#8212; and it will continue to do so in the future if appropriate. This assessment of performance, illustrated in the chart below, includes considerations of responsible leadership, thoughtful governance and sustainability where applicable: Business Principles Strategic Framework Balanced and holistic assessment of results against long-term strategic priorities and other qualitative considerations, with significant shortcomings in any performance dimension having unlimited downward&#160;potential ~50% weighting on the "what&#8221; ~50% weighting on the "how&#8221; Business Results Risk, Controls &amp; Conduct Client/Customer/Stakeholder Teamwork &amp; Leadership &#8226; Drive high performance, the right way &#8226; Fortress balance sheet &#8226; Operational resilience &#8226; Comprehensive set of products and services &#8226; Growing powerful brands &#8226; Disciplined investment in the&#160;future &#8226; Current &amp; multi-year financial performance, including but not limited to: &#8212; Managed Revenue &#8212; Pre-tax income ex.

In evaluating market data for OC members, the CMDC benchmarks against our primary financial services peer group, which consists of large financial services companies with which the Firm directly competes for both talent and business. The&#160;following companies comprise our primary financial services peer group, which remains unchanged from last year: &#8226; American Express &#8226; Bank of America &#8226; Citigroup&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8226; Goldman Sachs &#8226; Morgan Stanley&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8226; Wells Fargo Given the diversity of the Firm&#8217;s businesses, the CMDC may also periodically reference the pay plans and practices of other financial services companies as well as leading large, global firms across multiple industries. The CMDC considers the size, presence, brand and reputation of the companies, and the nature and mix of their businesses in using this data. These companies include some or all of the following: 3M, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, Barclays, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, Boeing,&#160;Capital One Financial, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Comcast, CVS Health, Deutsche Bank, ExxonMobil, GE Aerospace, HSBC,&#160;IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, PayPal, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, RTX, UBS, Verizon, Walmart and Walt Disney. Although these reference companies are not part of our primary financial services peer group, we believe that their practices can provide a relevant point of reference for maintaining a competitive talent and compensation&#160;program. Disciplined process to determine total compensation Pay level In determining total compensation levels for individual OC members, the CMDC evaluates various pay scenarios in light of the following considerations to inform its judgment: &#8226; Performance, based on the four broad assessment dimensions and discussed on pages 53 - 56 &#8226; Value of the position to the organization and shareholders over time (i.e., &#8220;value of seat&#8221;) &#8226; The example they set for others by acting with integrity and strengthening the Firm&#8217;s culture, Purpose and Values &#8226; External talent market (i.e., market data) While market data provides the CMDC with useful information regarding our competitors, the CMDC does not target specific positioning (e.g., 50 th percentile), nor does it use a formulaic approach in determining competitive pay levels. Instead, the CMDC uses a range of data as a reference, which is considered in the context of each executive&#8217;s performance over a multi-year period, and the CMDC&#8217;s assessment of the value the individual delivers to the Firm. Pay mix Once the CMDC determines OC members&#8217; total incentive compensation, it then establishes the appropriate pay mix between an annual cash award and long-term equity, including PSUs and RSUs. For U.S. OC members other than the current CEO and President, the CMDC continued to apply the Firm&#8217;s standard cash/equity incentive mix to each of their 2024 incentive compensation awards. Per the Firm&#8217;s mix, the OC members were awarded 60% of their incentive compensation in long-term equity (with 30% in PSUs and 30% in RSUs), and the remaining 40% paid in cash 1 . The CMDC determined that a 50%/50% mix of time-based RSUs and at-risk PSUs continues to provide an appropriate balance to their equity exposure. The CMDC believes that this significant weighting of pay mix to equity is aligned with the interests of shareholders by encouraging OC members to focus on the long-term success of the Firm while mitigating excessive risk-taking, and provides a competitive annual cash incentive opportunity. Messrs. Dimon and Pinto&#8217;s annual cash incentive awards are subject to a cap of 25% of their respective total compensation, with PSUs comprising 100% of the equity portion of their incentive compensation. The CMDC determined to not award the maximum amount allowed by their respective caps in 2024, but to maintain a lower cash award of $5 million each for Messrs. Dimon and&#160;Pinto. 1 The CMDC has established a different pay mix for OC members in the U.K. due to local regulations for Identified Staff, please refer to the Glossary for additional information. 46 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Compensation discussion and analysis &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Summary of pay elements Our compensation program provides for an appropriate mix between base salary, cash and equity incentives that vest over time.

Dimon and Pinto. Total compensation decisions for 2024 were not impacted by this increase, as the CMDC performed its balanced and holistic review of performance to determine total compensation. Option grants and material non-public information In 2024, the CMDC did not grant any stock options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs") to any OC member. Additionally, we do not time the disclosure of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 47 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Compensation discussion and analysis How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Performance Share Unit program The key features of our 2024 PSU program are substantially unchanged and are summarized below: Plan Feature Performance Year 2024 PSU Award Description Vehicle &#8226; Value of units moves with stock price during performance period; units are settled in shares at&#160;vesting. Time Horizon &#8226; Three-year cliff-vesting, plus an additional two-year holding period (for a combined five-year holding period). Due to local U.K. regulations, PSUs are subject to an extended seven-year vesting period commencing ratably on the third anniversary of the grant for OC members in the&#160;U.K. Performance Measure &#8226; The CMDC selected ROTCE, a comprehensive performance metric that measures the Firm&#8217;s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average tangible common equity. ROTCE is used by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the earnings power of common shareholders&#8217; equity capital and is a useful metric for comparing the profitability of the Firm with that of competitors. Payout Scale &#8226; Payout under the PSU plan is calculated at the end of the three-year performance period based on absolute and relative average ROTCE 1 , per the payout scale below. The use of both absolute and relative ROTCE helps promote a reasonable outcome for both shareholders and participants. For the 2024 PSU award, the CMDC set the absolute ROTCE thresholds as follows: (1) maximum payout at 18% or greater; and (2) zero payout at less than 6%. PSU Peers &#8226; In determining companies to include in the relative ROTCE scale, the CMDC selected competitors with business activities that overlap with at least 30% of the Firm&#8217;s revenue mix. These include Bank of America, Barclays, Capital One Financial, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Wells Fargo. Minimum Risk-based Hurdle &#8226; If the Firm&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio 2 is less than 8% at any year-end, then up to one-third of unvested PSUs will be subject to downward adjustment by the CMDC for each such year. Narrow Adjustment Provision &#8226; The CMDC may make adjustments (up or down) to maintain the intended economics of the award in light of changed circumstances (e.g., change in accounting rules/policies or changes in capital structure). The CMDC may also make additional downward adjustments in relation to PSUs granted to OC members in the U.K., including Mr. Pinto&#8217;s historically granted PSUs (refer to Note 1 on page&#160; 52 ). Our PSU program spans a 5-year time horizon PSU goal is set at beginning of performance period Performance Year 3-Year Post-Grant Performance Period (cliff-vest) &#160;+ 2-Year Additional Hold on Fully Vested Awards 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Award is determined Payout is calculated based on average ROTCE over the 3-year performance period &#160;= Ultimate number of units earned Awards subject to reduction/cancellation/clawback based on risk, control &amp; conduct features (including protection-based vesting) 1 Average ROTCE is calculated over the three-year post-grant performance period using unadjusted reported data as set forth in public financial disclosures. 2 The CET1 capital ratio is a key regulatory capital measure; refer to Additional notes, Note 1, on page 101 , for additional information on this measure. 48 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Compensation discussion and analysis &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Process to determine payout As part of the design of the PSU program, the ultimate number of PSUs paid out at vesting is determined by a pre-established formula set at the time of the award based on the Firm&#8217;s absolute and relative ROTCE performance over the subsequent three years, with the value of the payout ranging from 0% to 150% and subject to risk and control features. The value upon vesting of PSUs is also directly tied to the Firm&#8217;s performance through its stock price, similar to RSUs. The CMDC believes that the PSU design continues to appropriately incentivize strong performance by our OC members, does not encourage excessive risk-taking and is aligned with long-term shareholder interests. Since PSUs were first introduced in 2015, we have received positive shareholder support for this aspect of our executive compensation program. Determining absolute and relative PSU performance goals &#8226; Each year, in determining the absolute ROTCE goal and minimum ROTCE threshold for that year&#8217;s PSU awards, the CMDC reviews the Firm&#8217;s historical performance and a summary of a reasonable range of possible net income and capital outcomes over the next three years. For the 2024 PSU awards granted in January 2025, these outcomes were considered, evaluated and analyzed in the context of the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, interest rates, regulatory capital requirements and key business drivers, all of which affect the range of ROTCE outcomes in the medium-term. &#8226; The CMDC calibrated the upper ROTCE goal of the 2024 PSUs, representing exceptional financial performance over the three-year performance period, at 18% or more; and the lower ROTCE threshold, representing weak financial performance over the same period, at below 6%. &#8212; Of the three-year performance periods for the Firm and our PSU peers in the last 10 years, our PSU peers have achieved ROTCE of &gt;18% only 4 times, demonstrating the rigor of our upper ROTCE goal. &#8212; Our PSU peers have collectively reported three-year average ROTCE of &lt;6% for 16% of the time during that period, demonstrating the rigor of our lower absolute ROTCE&#160;threshold. &#8226; Furthermore, the Firm recognizes that there are substantial uncertainties in the current global economic environment that may have significant implications on financial institutions over the next three years. To this end, the CMDC believes that it has set upper and lower absolute performance thresholds that are sufficiently rigorous in this environment, including consideration of a current range of possible net income and capital outcomes over the next three years. &#8226; In setting the relative ROTCE performance goals for the 2024 PSU awards, the CMDC limited above-target payout to instances in which the Firm outperforms the majority of its competitors on a relative basis, with below-target payout occurring in instances of underperformance. Median relative performance results in below target payout, outstanding relative performance results in a payout of 150% and requires a top ranking, and bottom relative performance pays out at&#160;0%. &#8226; As reflected by the chart to the right, the Firm&#8217;s consistent relative outperformance of our ten PSU peers is demonstrated in particular by the strength of our three-year average ROTCE outperformance over the last 10 years. 3-YEAR AVERAGE ROTCE OF THE FIRM RELATIVE TO PSU PEERS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS 1,2 JPM PSU Peers PSUs awarded for performance years 2021, 2022, and 2023 &#8226; The Firm reported ROTCE 1 of 18%, 21%, and 22% in 2022, 2023, and 2024 respectively, resulting in a three-year average ROTCE of 20%, outperforming the absolute threshold for the 2021 PSU awards granted in January 2022. On March 25, 2025, the 2021 PSU awards vested at 150%. For the 2022 and 2023 PSU awards, the payouts will be calculated once the performance period ends on December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2026 respectively, based on the Firm&#8217;s absolute and relative three-year average ROTCE performance. 1 ROTCE is a non-GAAP financial measure; refer to Note 1 on page 100 for a further discussion of this measure. 2 Peer ROTCE based on public disclosures (Form 10-K, Annual Report). &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 49 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Compensation discussion and analysis How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Strong ownership &amp; accountability provisions Stock ownership guideline and retention requirements The CMDC believes it is important to align the interests of our OC members with those of our shareholders. To meet this objective, OC members are subject to a stock ownership guideline and retention policy. While on the Operating Committee, each member is required to accumulate either: &#8226; A minimum of between 200,000 and 400,000 shares (1&#160;million shares for the CEO); or &#8226; A minimum fixed dollar value of shares of between $10&#160;million and $30 million ($75 million for the CEO). &#8212; In 2024, this represented 10x to 30x of OC member base salary, or 50x for the CEO. Shares credited for purposes of satisfying the above ownership levels include shares owned outright, as well as 50% of unvested RSUs and PSUs, but do not include SARs or stock options (whether exercisable or unexercisable). The stock ownership guideline must be met within 6&#160;years of the later of the effective date of the policy or appointment to the Operating Committee. If the stock ownership guidelines are subsequently increased, the higher ownership guideline must be satisfied within 6&#160;years of such revision, unless otherwise determined by the CEO and CMDC. Prior to reaching their designated share ownership guideline, OC members are required to retain 75% of all net shares received from equity awards granted after they join the Operating Committee. Once they have met their ownership guideline, the policy requires OC members to retain 50% of all net shares received from awards (75% for the CEO) as summarized&#160;below: Retention Requirement Before Guideline Met After Guideline Met 75% of net shares until stock ownership guideline is met 50% of net shares for the duration of their service&#160;on&#160;the OC (75% for CEO) Because OC members are required to continue accumulating shares even after having met their share ownership guideline, the resulting increase of share ownership over time further strengthens the alignment of their interests with those of our shareholders. Notably, since he became CEO, Mr. Dimon has acquired a substantial amount of stock through compensation and purchases on the open market. Anti-hedging/anti-pledging provisions All employees are prohibited from hedging or pledging unvested RSUs and PSUs, and unexercised SARs or stock options. In addition: &#8226; Shares owned outright or through deferred compensation by an OC member may not be hedged. &#8226; Shares held directly by an OC or Board member 1 may not be held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged. Integrating risk with compensation The CMDC holds an annual joint session with the Risk Committee to review our HR and compensation practices,&#160;including: &#8226; How we integrate risk, controls and conduct considerations into key HR practices including performance development, compensation and promotion. &#8226; Compensation features and elements designed to discourage imprudent risk-taking (e.g., multi-year vesting, clawbacks, prohibition on hedging, etc.). &#8226; Annual incentive pool processes for LOBs and Corporate functions. &#8226; Regulatory updates which have impacted or may impact HR practices in the future. The committees are also provided with information on our performance development process, a summary of risk, controls and conduct framework and impacts, and updates regarding HR Control Forum issues. 1 For information on the hedging/pledging restrictions applicable to our directors, please see &#8220;Director compensation&#8221; on pages 32 and 33 . 50 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Compensation discussion and analysis &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Strong accountability and recovery provisions Our compensation program is designed to hold employees accountable, including executives, when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues that may negatively impact business performance or the Firm&#8217;s reputation in current or future&#160;years. Issues that may warrant recovery determinations can be raised at any time, including in HR Control Forums and annual assessments of employee performance. Under the Firm&#8217;s process to govern these determinations: &#8226; We have established a process for reviewing compensation or other employee actions following a determination that the cause and materiality of a risk-related loss, issue or other set of facts and circumstances warrants such a review of accountability for actual or potential misconduct. &#8226; The CMDC is responsible for determinations involving OC members (determinations involving the CEO are subject to ratification by independent members of the Board). The Firm has a framework that identifies and assesses employee risk and drives consistent management decisions and discipline. For more material risk and control issues, the HR Control Forum process described below explains how issues are reviewed and impacts are&#160;considered.

Holding individuals accountable To hold individuals responsible for taking risks inconsistent with the Firm&#8217;s risk appetite and to discourage future imprudent behavior, the Firm has policies and procedures that enable it to take timely and proportionate actions, including: I. Reduce or altogether eliminate annual incentive compensation; II. Cancel unvested awards (in full or in part); III. Clawback/Recover previously paid incentive compensation, which includes cash&#160;and/or equity (i.e., RSUs and PSUs); IV. Demotion, negative performance rating or other appropriate employment actions; and V. Termination of employment. The Firm has a framework in place that provides for recommended impacts to drive consistency. However, the precise actions we take with respect to accountable individuals, which may also include coaching and training, are based on the relevant circumstances, including the nature of their involvement, the magnitude of the event and the impact on the Firm. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 51 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Compensation discussion and analysis How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 Clawback/recovery provisions We maintain clawback/recovery provisions on both cash incentives and equity awards that enable us to reduce or cancel unvested awards and recover previously paid compensation in certain situations. While incentive awards are intended and expected to vest according to their terms, the Firm&#8217;s strong recovery provisions permit recovery of incentive compensation awards in appropriate circumstances. As disclosed in the Firm's 2024 Proxy Statement, in 2023, the Firm adopted a new Policy for the Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation to comply with the applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act, which includes provisions that apply to the Firm&#8217;s executive officers and operates in addition to the recovery provisions in the summary table below. The Policy for the Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation is filed as Exhibit 97 of the Firm&#8217;s 2024 Form 10-K. Clawback disclosure In 2024, we did not take any action to recover or clawback any incentive compensation from our OC members or the Firmwide Controller.

The Firm manages its business and the associated risks in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and shareholders, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. We continue to invest in strengthening our controls and infrastructure and improving how we serve our customers and clients. Additionally, as digital solutions continue to evolve and play a role in financial services and the economy as a whole, the risk of cyberattacks and other threats to information security continues to evolve and grow, and we continue to invest in enhancing our cyber defense capabilities. Cybersecurity and data privacy Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm, and significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices and other technology. The Firm&#8217;s security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in unauthorized access to confidential information, the destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. The Firm continues to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. As a global financial institution, the Firm collects, processes, uses, shares and dispositions personal and financial information every day, and we have processes designed to manage that data in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We continue to take a multi-faceted approach to addressing privacy and data protection risks, including maintaining and evolving our internal controls, establishing policies covering all stages of the data lifecycle and deploying appropriate technology. Continued focus on culture and conduct We continue to reinforce our culture and remain focused on managing employee conduct. Our Business Principles are embedded throughout the employee lifecycle, starting with the onboarding process and extending to ongoing training, compensation, promoting and rewarding employees; and our performance development and compensation processes are designed to hold employees accountable for their conduct, where appropriate. We recognize our employees are a key driver of our success and that it is through their service, heart, curiosity, courage and excellence that we are able to deliver for our customers, communities and shareholders. We continue to set high standards for manager expectations to drive a strong culture and promote engagement with our employees. We strive to clearly and frequently communicate our expectations that all employee conduct must adhere to the highest ethical standards encompassed by our Business Principles, including through senior leadership messages and conduct training. The Firm endeavors to promote a culture of respect that allows every employee to feel safe and empowered at work. To that end, the Firm has in place employee training and protocols for preventing, reporting and addressing sexual, discriminatory or other misconduct and prohibits retaliation against an individual who reports a concern in good faith or assists with any inquiry or investigation.

Morgan Securities plc Board. Interpreting 2024 NEO compensation The table above is presented to show how the CMDC and Board viewed compensation awarded for 2024 performance. It differs from how compensation is reported in the &#8220;Summary compensation table&#8221; (&#8220;SCT&#8221;) on page 64 , which is required by the SEC, and is not intended as a substitute for the SCT. There are two principal differences between the SCT and the table above: 1. The Firm grants both cash and equity incentive compensation after a performance year is completed. In both the table above and the SCT, cash incentive compensation paid in 2025 for 2024 performance is shown as 2024 compensation. In the table above, the equity awards (RSUs and PSUs) granted in 2025 for 2024 performance are shown as 2024 compensation. In contrast, the SCT reports the value of equity awards in the year in which they are granted. As a result, awards granted in 2024 for 2023 performance are shown in the SCT as 2024 compensation. 2. The table above does not show the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation and all other compensation, which are reported in the SCT. In addition to showing the 2024 amounts, the SCT shows revised all other compensation amounts for 2023 and 2022. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 57 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Compensation discussion and analysis How we think about pay decisions How we performed against our&#160;business strategy How performance determined&#160;pay in 2024 2024 CEO annual compensation is aligned with multi-year performance &#160; James Dimon Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer In determining Mr. Dimon&#8217;s compensation, independent members of the Board considered his exemplary leadership and achievements across the Firm&#8217;s four broad performance dimensions.

Cash incentive compensation reflects compensation earned in connection with the performance year shown, which was awarded in January of the following year. 3 Includes amounts awarded during the year shown. Amounts are the fair value on the grant date in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Actual amounts of PSUs received by NEOs upon vesting may range from 0% to 150% of the target shares (excluding accrued dividends), depending upon the Firm&#8217;s performance. At the maximum level of performance, the value of PSUs awarded in 2024 would be: $44,250,000 for Mr. Dimon; $35,250,000 for Mr. Pinto; $11,812,500 for Ms. Erdoes; $10,012,500 for Mr. Rohrbaugh; and $6,412,500 for Mr. Barnum.

No NEOs had earnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate on deferred compensation balances where the rate of return is not calculated in the same or in a similar manner as earnings on hypothetical investments under the Firm&#8217;s qualified plans. The amount of earnings in excess of 120% of the applicable federal rate included in this column is $0 for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. 5 &#8220;All other compensation&#8221; includes the cost, if any, for a NEO&#8217;s immediate family member to attend business-related events where familial attendance is expected or customary. This did not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the NEO&#8217;s total perquisites and personal benefits except as specifically noted in the footnotes that follow. 6 The 2024 &#8220;All other compensation&#8221; amount for Mr. Dimon includes: $5,000 in employer non-matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plan; $420,220 for filing fee and related professional services fees relating to Mr. Dimon&#8217;s compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976; $293,753 for personal use of corporate aircraft; $31,522 for personal use of corporate cars; and $882,141 for the cost of residential, personal travel, and related security paid by the Firm. 2023 and 2022 &#8220;All other compensation&#8221; amounts for Mr. Dimon include previously unreported amounts primarily related to prescribed enhanced security measures for Mr. Dimon (totaling $866,479 and $761,407, respectively).

Grants made as part of the annual incentive compensation process are generally awarded in January after fourth quarter earnings are released. RSUs and PSUs carry no voting rights. On January&#160;21, 2025, the Firm awarded RSU and PSU awards as part of 2024 annual incentive compensation. Because these awards were granted in 2025, they do not appear in this table, which is required to include only equity awards actually granted during 2024. These 2025 awards are however reflected in the &#8220;NEO annual compensation table" on page 57 . 2 PSUs vest on March 25, 2027, and are subject to a two-year holding period post-vesting. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date. The ultimate number of PSUs that will vest will be determined by the Firm&#8217;s performance over the three-year performance period and will include any accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares. The dividend equivalent shares, if any, will be based on: (1) the number of PSUs earned at vesting; and (2) dividends that would have been paid on the Firm&#8217;s common stock during the vesting period as of each dividend payment date, if any. 3 RSUs vest in two equal installments on January 13, 2026 and 2027. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock on the vesting date and non-preferential dividend equivalents, payable in cash, equal to any dividends paid on the Firm&#8217;s common stock during the vesting period. 4 The grant date fair value for RSUs and PSUs is based on the average of the high and the low prices of JPMorganChase common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of units granted (for RSUs) or target number of PSUs. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 65 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Executive compensation tables III.

Stock awards Name Number of shares acquired on vesting (#) Value realized on vesting ($) 1 James Dimon 292,667&#160; $ 57,260,271&#160; Daniel Pinto 170,536&#160; 31,790,704&#160; Mary Callahan Erdoes 112,274&#160; 21,017,955&#160; Troy Rohrbaugh 113,743&#160; 21,271,512&#160; Jeremy Barnum 17,911&#160; 3,091,528&#160; 1 Values were determined by multiplying the number of PSUs and RSUs, as applicable, that vested by the per-share fair market value of our common stock on the vesting date. V. 2024 Pension benefits The table below sets forth the retirement benefits expected to be paid to our Named Executive Officers under the Firm&#8217;s retirement plans. The terms of the plans are described below the table. No payments were made under these plans during 2024 to our NEOs. Name Plan name Number of years of credited service (#) Present value of accumulated benefit ($) James Dimon Retirement Plan 19&#160; $ 237,194&#160; Excess Retirement Plan 19&#160; 564,286&#160; Daniel Pinto &#8212; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Mary Callahan Erdoes Retirement Plan 23&#160; 376,429&#160; Excess Retirement Plan 23&#160; 33,488&#160; Troy Rohrbaugh Retirement Plan 14&#160; 95,496&#160; Jeremy Barnum Retirement Plan 23&#160; 227,528&#160; Retirement Plan &#8212; The JPMorgan Chase Retirement Plan is a qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to most U.S. employees. The Plan was frozen with respect to pay credit contributions, effective January 1, 2020, and frozen with respect to new entrants into the Plan, effective January 1, 2019. Employees became fully vested in the value of their Plan benefits as a result of this change. The years of service listed above are as of the freeze date. The Plan employed a cash balance formula (in the form of pay and interest credits) to determine amounts at retirement. Pay credits ceased effective with the plan freeze. Interest credits, which generally equal the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury bills plus 1% (subject to a minimum of 4.5%), continue to accrue. Account balances include the value of benefits earned under prior heritage company plans, if any. Benefits are payable as an actuarially equivalent lifetime annuity with survivorship rights (if married) or optionally under a variety of other payment forms, including a single-sum distribution. Excess Retirement Plan &#8212; Benefits were determined under the same terms and conditions as the Retirement Plan, but reflecting base salary in excess of IRS limits up to $1 million and benefit amounts in excess of IRS limits. Benefits are generally payable in a lump sum in the year following termination. The plan is closed to new participants and accruals under the plan were discontinued as of May 1, 2009. Present value of accumulated benefits &#8212; The valuation method and all material assumptions used to calculate the amounts above are consistent with those reflected in Note 8 to the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2024 Form 10-K on pages 230 - 232. Key assumptions include the discount rate (5.65%); interest rates (interest crediting rates of 5.20% for 2025, and 5.25% thereafter, to project cash balances; 4.80% to convert annuities to lump sums and lump sums to 68 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Executive compensation tables &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation annuities) and mortality rates (for the present value of annuities, the Pri-2012 (white-collar) projected generational mortality table with projection scale MP2021; for lump sums, the UP94 mortality table projected to 2002, with 50%/50% male/female weighting). We assumed benefits would commence at normal retirement date or unreduced retirement date, if earlier. Benefits paid from the Retirement Plan were assumed to be paid either as single-sum distributions (with probability of 85%) or life annuities (with probability of 15%). Benefits from the Excess Retirement Plan are paid as single-sum distributions. No death or other separation from service was assumed prior to retirement date. VI. 2024 Non-qualified deferred compensation The Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible participants to defer their annual cash incentive compensation awards on a before-tax basis up to a maximum of $1 million. A lifetime $10 million cap applies to deferrals of cash made after 2005. No deferral elections have been permitted relative to equity awards since 2006. During 2024, there were no contributions made by the Firm nor contributions made or withdrawals or distributions received by the Named Executive Officers. Name Aggregate earnings (loss) in last fiscal year ($) 1 Aggregate balance at last fiscal year&#8211;end ($) James Dimon $ 9,027&#160; $ 171,116&#160; Daniel Pinto 864&#160; 27,312&#160; Mary Callahan Erdoes &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Troy Rohrbaugh &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Jeremy Barnum &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; 1 The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to direct their deferrals among several investment choices, including JPMorganChase common stock; an interest income fund based 50% on a weighted average of returns by Hartford Investment Management Company SVA Bond Index Division and 50% by Newport Group designated set of general account life insurance policies owned by JPMorganChase; Hartford funds indexed to fixed income, bond, balanced, S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000 and international portfolios; and Hartford investments in Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund high-yield bond, mid-cap and REIT index. In addition, there are balances in deemed investment choices from heritage company plans that are no longer open to new deferrals. Investment returns in 2024 for the following investment choices were: Short-Term Fixed Income, 6.36%; Interest Income, 3.28%; Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, 1.19%; High-Yield, 6.3%; Balanced Portfolio, 12.59%; S&amp;P 500 Index, 24.96%; Mid-Cap Index, 15.08%; Russell 2000 Index, 11.42%; REIT Index, 4.74%; International, 9.01%; and JPMorganChase common stock, including dividend equivalents, 44.27%. Beginning with deferrals credited January 2005 under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants were required to elect to receive distribution of the deferral balance beginning either following retirement or termination or in a specific year but no earlier than the second anniversary of the date the deferral would otherwise have been paid. If retirement or termination were elected, payments will commence during the calendar year following retirement or termination. Participants may elect the distribution to be lump sum or annual installments for a maximum of 15 years. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2004, under the Deferred Compensation Plan, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following termination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 15 years of service. With respect to deferrals made after December 31, 2017, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following termination if employment terminates prior to the participant attaining 5 years of service. The Supplemental Savings and Investment Plan (&#8220;SSIP&#8221;) is a heritage plan applicable to former Bank One employees which is closed to new participants and does not permit new deferrals. It functions similarly to the Deferred Compensation Plan. The investment return in 2024 for the following investment choice was: Short-Term Fixed Income, 5.56%. With respect to the SSIP, account balances are automatically paid as a lump sum in the year following termination unless an installment option is elected prior to termination of&#160;employment. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 69 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Executive compensation tables VII. 2024 Potential payments upon termination or change in control We believe our pay practices relating to termination events, summarized below, illustrate our commitment to sound corporate governance, are consistent with best practices and are aligned with shareholder interests. Termination policies aligned with shareholder interests No golden parachute agreements &#8226; NEOs are not entitled to any accelerated cash/equity payments or special benefits upon a change in control No employment agreements &#8226; NEOs are &#8220;at will&#8221; employees and are not covered by employment agreements No special cash severance &#8226; Severance amounts for NEOs are capped at one-year salary, not to exceed $400,000 No special executive benefits &#8226; NEOs are not entitled to any special benefits upon termination Standard, broad-based severance Mr. Dimon, Mr. Pinto, Ms. Erdoes, Mr. Rohrbaugh and Mr. Barnum are covered under the Firm&#8217;s broad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan. Benefits under the U.S. Severance Pay Plan are based on an employee&#8217;s base salary and length of service on termination of employment. Employees remain eligible for coverage at active employee rates under certain of the Firm&#8217;s employee welfare plans (such as medical and dental) for up to six months after their employment terminates. In addition, in the event of termination by the Firm for reasons other than cause, employees may be considered, at the discretion of the Firm, for a cash payment in lieu of an annual incentive compensation award, taking into consideration all circumstances the Firm deems relevant, including the circumstances of the employee&#8217;s leaving and the employee&#8217;s contributions to the Firm over his or her career. Severance benefits and any such discretionary payment are subject to execution of a release in favor of the Firm and certain post-termination restrictions. The table on the following page sets forth the benefits and compensation which the Named Executive Officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2024. The amounts shown in the table on the following page do not include other payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees upon termination of employment, such as accrued vacation pay, distributions from the 401(k) Savings Plan, pension and deferred compensation plans, or any death, disability or post retirement welfare benefits available under broad-based employee plans. For information on the pension and deferred compensation plans, see &#8220;Table V: 2024 Pension benefits&#8221; on page 68 and 69 and &#8220;Table VI: 2024 Non-qualified deferred compensation&#8221; on page 69 . Such tables also do not show the value of exercisable SARs, which would be listed in &#8220;Table III: Outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2024&#8221; on pages 66 and 67 ; however, there were no exercisable SARs outstanding on December 31, 2024. NEOs are not entitled to any additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination. Rather, under certain termination scenarios including disability, death, termination without cause, or resignation (if full-career eligible), NEOs&#8217; outstanding equity awards continue to vest in accordance with their terms (or accelerate in the event of death). The table on the following page shows the value of these unvested RSUs, PSUs and SARs based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31,&#160;2024. Government Office provision Employees with applicable awards, including NEOs, are covered under the Firm&#8217;s Government Office provision which allows for continued vesting of equity awards if the employee resigns to accept a covered government office. For such employees who are full-career eligible, outstanding performance year awards continue to vest in accordance with their terms whether they leave the Firm to enter government service or otherwise, so, for these awards, the Government Office provision does not provide any benefit to employees who are full-career eligible. All NEOs meet the full-career eligibility provision of their applicable awards. 1 For employees who are not full-career eligible, and for awards that do not have full career eligibility provisions, the value of awards that would continue to vest as a result of the Government Office provision of our equity plan would equal a percentage of the unvested stock awards ranging from 0% prior to three years of employment by the Firm to 50% after three years of employment increasing to 100% after five years. 1 Refer to Notes 3 and 6 on page 71 . 70 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Executive compensation tables &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation The Firm&#8217;s Government Office provision allows for accelerated vesting of the awards otherwise eligible for continued vesting, as described above, only if government ethics or conflicts of interest laws require divestiture of unvested awards and do not allow continued vesting. Notwithstanding acceleration of any awards, the former employee remains subject to the applicable terms of the award agreement as if the award had remained outstanding for the duration of the original vesting period, including the clawback provisions and post-employment obligations. Any awards not eligible for continued vesting under the terms of the plan are forfeited and they do not accelerate. In 2024, no current or former OC member received any benefits under the Government Office provision. 2024 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL Termination reason 1 Name Involuntary without cause ($) 2 Resignation per Full-Career Eligibility provision ($) 3 Disability 4 Death ($) 5 Resignation per Government Office provision ($) 6 Change in control ($) James Dimon Severance and other $ 400,000&#160; $ &#8212;&#160; $ &#8212;&#160; $ &#8212;&#160; $ &#8212;&#160; $ &#8212;&#160; SARs &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; 136,470,000&#160; 136,470,000&#160; 136,470,000&#160; &#8212;&#160; RSUs &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; PSUs 7 163,227,337&#160; 163,227,337&#160; 163,227,337&#160; 186,959,516&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Daniel Pinto Severance and other 400,000&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; SARs &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; 60,461,250&#160; 60,461,250&#160; 60,461,250&#160; &#8212;&#160; RSUs 99,923,833&#160; 99,923,833&#160; 99,923,833&#160; 99,923,833&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; PSUs 7 100,507,868&#160; 100,507,868&#160; 100,507,868&#160; 119,232,702&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Mary Callahan Erdoes Severance and other 400,000&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; RSUs 28,674,110&#160; 28,674,110&#160; 28,674,110&#160; 28,674,110&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; PSUs 7 39,583,630&#160; 39,583,630&#160; 39,583,630&#160; 45,889,668&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Troy Rohrbaugh Severance and other 392,308&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; RSUs 25,502,267&#160; 25,502,267&#160; 25,502,267&#160; 25,502,267&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; PSUs 7 37,103,161&#160; 37,103,161&#160; 37,103,161&#160; 42,496,395&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; Jeremy Barnum Severance and other 376,923&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; RSUs 14,114,125&#160; 14,114,125&#160; 14,114,125&#160; 14,114,125&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; PSUs 7 19,255,590&#160; 19,255,590&#160; 19,255,590&#160; 22,291,054&#160; &#8212;&#160; &#8212;&#160; 1 "SARs," &#8220;RSUs&#8221; and &#8220;PSUs&#8221; refer to previously granted, outstanding equity awards. NEOs are not entitled to any additional equity awards in connection with a potential termination. Potential payments upon termination would be subject to compliance with applicable terms and conditions of each outstanding equity award, including confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations. 2 Involuntary terminations without cause include involuntary terminations due to redundancies and involuntary terminations without alternative employment. For &#8220;Severance and other,&#8221; amounts shown represent severance under the Firm&#8217;s broad-based U.S. Severance Pay Plan. Base salary greater than $400,000 per year is disregarded for purposes of determining severance amounts. 3 For employees in good standing who have resigned and have met full-career eligibility or other acceptable criteria, awards continue to vest over time on their original schedule, provided that the employees, for the remainder of the vesting period, do not perform services for a financial services company or work in their profession (whether or not for a financial services company); provided that employees may work for a government, education or not-for-profit organization. The awards shown represent RSUs and PSUs that would continue to vest because the NEOs have met the full-career eligibility criteria. The awards are subject to continuing post-employment obligations to the Firm during this period. 4 In the case of disability, stock awards continue to vest pursuant to their original vesting schedule. 5 Vesting restrictions on stock awards and restrictions upon exercise of SARs lapse immediately upon death. 6 The Government Office provision of an award does not provide any benefit to employees who have met the full-career eligibility provision of that same award. Therefore, under the terms of the Government Office provision, NEOs would generally not receive any benefit upon termination since they meet the full-career eligibility provision entitling them to continued vesting of their equity awards (see preceding Note 3). For awards that do not have the full career eligibility provision, the amount reported is based on the December 31, 2024 value of the award in which the NEO is eligible to continue to vest. 7 For death, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 18, 2022, January 17, 2023, and January 16, 2024 assuming: (a) maximum payout related to 2022, 2023, and 2024 performance years; (b) target payout related to 2025 and 2026 performance years; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of December 31, 2024. For involuntary without cause, full career eligibility provision and disability, represents the value of PSUs granted on January 18, 2022, January 17, 2023, and January 16, 2024 assuming: (a) maximum payout related to PSUs granted in 2022; (b) target payout related to PSUs granted in 2023 and 2024; and (c) accumulated reinvested dividend equivalent shares as of December 31, 2024. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 71 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Pay versus performance disclosure Pay versus performance disclosure Pay Versus Performance table The following table presents the executive Compensation Actually Paid (&#8220;CAP&#8221;) for our Principal Executive Officer (&#8220;PEO&#8221;) and non-PEO NEOs relative to the Firm&#8217;s financial performance in the format specified by the SEC pursuant to Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The CMDC does not utilize CAP for compensation considerations and determinations; for more information on our compensation philosophy and pay decisions for our Named Executive Officers, see our &#8220;Compensation discussion and analysis&#8221; which starts on page 39 . The Firm continues to consider ROTCE its most important company-selected financial performance measure for compensation. ROTCE is a comprehensive performance metric that measures the Firm&#8217;s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average tangible common equity, and reflects how well management is using shareholders&#8217; equity to generate profit. It is a fundamental performance metric that is widely used by the Firm, investors and analysts in assessing the earnings power of common shareholders&#8217; equity capital, and is useful for comparing the profitability of the Firm with that of our&#160;competitors.

These amounts were identified before the filing of this proxy statement. 3 The following table details the adjustments that were made to SCT values to determine CAP, as presented in the above table. For the CAP portions that are calculated based on the average of the high and low JPM stock price at the end of the reporting year, the following prices were used: 2024 $ 240.24 ; 2023 $ 170.16 ; 2022 $ 133.39 ; 2021 $ 158.63 ; 2020 $ 126.08 .

In 2021, PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP were sharply higher than in 2020 as they included one-time special awards in the form of SARs granted to Mr. Dimon in July 2021 and Mr. Pinto in December 2021. In 2022, both PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP decreased significantly from 2021, due to a decrease in the Firm&#8217;s stock price as of year-end 2022, consistent with the broader market decline. The largest impact of the change in the stock price was on Messrs.&#160;Dimon and Pinto&#8217;s outstanding SARs awards, both of which were out of the money as of the end of 2022. In 2023 and 2024, the increases in both PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP were attributable to an increase in the Firm&#8217;s stock price as of year- end, which outperformed the S&amp;P Financials Index as well as the broader market in general. Additionally, the PEO and non-PEO NEO average CAP were impacted by Messrs. Dimon and Pinto&#8217;s outstanding SARs awards, both of which were in&#160;the money as of the end of 2023 and 2024. In summary, the Firm&#8217;s PEO CAP and non-PEO NEO average CAP reflect a general correlation with: &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s stock price and TSR, primarily due to a significant majority of our NEOs&#8217; compensation being in the form of long-term equity &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s net income, which reflects our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy and practices &#8226; The Firm&#8217;s ROTCE, which reflects the Firm's strong returns and fortress balance sheet In addition, the Firm&#8217;s change in TSR over the past five years reflects a general correlation with that of the broader S&amp;P Financials&#160;Index. Unranked tabular list of the Firm&#8217;s most important financial performance measures As required by SEC rules, the most important financial performance measures that the Firm used to link executive compensation during the last fiscal year to company performance are listed below. Performance Measures Managed revenue for the Firm and the lines of business Pre-tax income (ex. LLR) for the Firm and some lines of business, and Pre-tax income for other lines of business Net income for the Firm and the lines of business ROTCE for the Firm and ROE for the lines of business 74 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents CEO pay ratio disclosure &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Executive compensation CEO pay ratio disclosure We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our estimated median employee and the annual total compensation of Mr. Dimon, our Chairman and CEO. CEO pay ratio For the year ended December 31, 2024: &#8226; The annual total compensation of Mr. Dimon was $37,694,334 1 , including Firm-paid employee benefits &#8226; The annual total compensation of our estimated median employee was $108,218 2 , including Firm-paid employee benefits &#8226; This represents a ratio of 348 to 1 Identifying our median employee We believe there were no material changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements in 2024 that would have necessitated a change to our CEO pay ratio calculation methodology. Therefore, as permitted under SEC rules, for this year&#8217;s disclosure we have used the 2024 annual total compensation of the same estimated median employee that we identified for disclosure in our 2024 and 2023 Proxy Statements. Consistent with the disclosure in our 2024 and 2023 Proxy Statements, annual total compensation included salary as of December 31, 2022, as well as overtime pay, fixed allowance and incentive compensation, if applicable. We annualized the salary portion of the compensation for employees who were hired during 2022; however, we did not make any full-time equivalent adjustments to part-time, temporary and seasonal employees. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. In determining the scope of our employees (other than our CEO), we included our global workforce of full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees who were employed as of December&#160;31, 2022. Comparability We believe the ratio above is a reasonable estimate, based on the methodology we have described. Given the different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions other companies may use to calculate their respective CEO pay ratios, as well as differences in employment and compensation practices between companies, the estimated ratio reported above may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. 1 For purposes of the CEO pay ratio disclosure, Mr. Dimon&#8217;s annual total compensation includes the amount reported in the &#8220;Total&#8221; column of the 2024 Summary compensation table on page 64 which includes change in pension value, plus the value of Firm contributions to broad-based employee benefits applicable to Mr. Dimon. 2 The estimated median employee&#8217;s annual total compensation includes change in pension value, plus the value of Firm contributions to broad-based employee benefits and 401(k) plan contributions. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 75 Table of Contents Executive compensation &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Security ownership of directors and executive officers Security ownership of directors and executive officers Our share retention policies require share ownership for directors and executive officers, as described on pages 33 and 50 ,&#160;respectively.

The Audit Committee has appointed PwC as the Firm&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Consolidated Financial Statements of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2025. The Audit Committee annually evaluates PwC&#8217;s qualifications, performance and independence in connection with its determination as to whether to retain PwC. For information on the factors evaluated by the Audit Committee, see the Audit Committee Report on pages 81 - 82 . The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that continued retention of PwC as the Firm&#8217;s independent external auditor is in the best interests of JPMorganChase and its shareholders. PwC and its predecessors have acted as our independent registered public accounting firm since 1965. The Board believes the Firm receives significant benefits from the extensive history PwC has with the Firm. These benefits include: &#8226; the high quality of its audit work and accounting advice, as a result of their institutional knowledge of&#160;our businesses, global operations, key risks, accounting policies, financial systems and internal control framework; &#8226; its audit efficiency and effectiveness, which results in a lower fee structure due to their history and familiarity with our&#160;businesses; &#8226; the time and expense that would be avoided by management and staff in order to onboard a new auditor;&#160;and &#8226; its commitment to maintaining their independence from the Firm. A member of PwC will be present at the annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. Board oversight of PwC The Audit Committee held eight private sessions with PwC during 2024. The Audit Committee assesses PwC&#8217;s independence throughout the year. This includes reviewing with PwC its practices for maintaining its independence. The Audit Committee has also established policies and procedures for approving services provided by PwC. It is JPMorganChase&#8217;s policy to use PwC only for audit and audit-related services, as well as tax services in certain circumstances. For more information, see "Audit Committee approval policies and procedures" on page 80 . No member of PwC&#8217;s audit team may be hired by the Firm for a period of one year after such person transferred from the Firm&#8217;s audit engagement to another role at PwC, or has terminated employment with PwC. Further, no former PwC employee who was a manager or partner may be hired by the Firm as the CFO, Principal Accounting Officer, General Auditor, Treasurer, Director of Tax or CFO or Controller of a LOB or Corporate function for a period of two years following his or her termination of employment with PwC. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years of service an individual partner may provide audit services to the Firm. The lead audit partner and quality review partner may provide services to our Firm for a maximum of five consecutive years. The Audit Committee approved the selection of the current lead audit partner beginning with the 2021 audit engagement. The lead audit partner is expected to serve in this capacity through the end of the 2025 audit. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 79 Table of Contents Audit matters &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Proposal 3: Ratification of independent registered public accounting firm Fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP The Audit Committee is responsible for negotiating the terms and fees associated with the Firm&#8217;s retention of PwC, including the annual integrated audit of the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. Aggregate fees for professional services rendered by PwC for JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, were: Year ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2024 2023 Audit $ 78.5&#160; $ 77.5&#160; Audit-related 36.0&#160; 31.0&#160; Tax 4.5&#160; 3.9&#160; Total $ 119.0&#160; $ 112.4&#160; The amounts reported in the table above exclude all fees paid to PwC by investment companies and asset management funds (e.g., private equity, mutual and exchange-traded funds, and collective investment funds), and special purpose vehicles that are sponsored, managed or advised by subsidiaries of JPMorganChase but are not consolidated with the Firm. Reported Audit fees are those applicable to each fiscal year's engagements. Audit-related and Tax fees are reported based on services rendered during each fiscal year. Audit fees For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, fees for the annual integrated audit of the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, and quarterly reviews of the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements, were $52.2 million and $51.7 million, respectively. Fees for services related to statutory/subsidiary audits, attestation reports required by statute or regulation, and comfort letters and consents related to SEC filings and other similar filings with non-U.S. authorities were $26.3 million and $25.8 million, respectively. Audit-related fees Audit-related fees comprise assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services include attestation and agreed-upon procedures which address accounting, reporting and control matters relating to fiduciary, transaction processing, investment management, servicing activities and ESG initiatives; reviews related to investment and lending processes, and technology systems; and due diligence reviews related to acquisitions and divestitures. These services are normally provided in connection with the recurring audit engagement. The increase in audit-related fees is primarily driven by services rendered during the calendar year, including complying with additional control reporting requirements, as well as new engagements due to continued business growth. Tax fees Fees for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, for tax compliance and tax return preparation services were $4.3&#160;million and $3.7 million, respectively. Fees for other tax services, including tax advisory and consultation on tax matters, were $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Audit Committee approval policies and&#160;procedures The Audit Committee&#8217;s policies and procedures require the Audit Committee to pre-approve a list of specified audit, audit-related and tax services, and review and approve the terms and fees for the annual integrated audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements. All requests for audit, audit-related and tax services that are not on the pre-approved list of specified services must be approved by the Audit Committee. JPMorganChase&#8217;s pre-approval policy does not provide for a de minimis exception under which the pre-approval requirement may be waived. Pre-approved services to be performed by PwC with estimated costs in excess of $250,000 are approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee; and pre-approved services with estimated costs less than or equal to $250,000 are delegated to the Firmwide Controller&#8217;s office for approval. 80 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Audit Committee report &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Audit matters Audit Committee report The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of JPMorganChase is comprised of four non-management directors. The Board has determined that each member of our committee has no material relationship with the Firm under the Board&#8217;s director independence standards and that each member is independent under the listing standards of the NYSE, where the Firm&#8217;s securities are listed, and under the SEC&#8217;s standards relating to the independence of audit committees. The Board has also determined that each member is financially literate and is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the&#160;SEC. Charter The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which is available on our website at jpmorganchase.com/about/governance/board-committees/audit-committee. We annually review our charter and our practices. We have determined that our charter and practices are consistent with the listing standards of the NYSE and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of: &#8226; the independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s qualifications and independence, &#8226; the performance of the Firm&#8217;s internal audit function and the independent registered public accounting firm, and &#8226; management&#8217;s responsibilities to assure that there is in place an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the assets and income of the Firm; assure the integrity of the Firm&#8217;s financial statements; and maintain compliance with the Firm&#8217;s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. Audit communications and fees We discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees , including PwC&#8217;s overall audit scope and audit approach as set forth in the terms of their engagement letter; PwC&#8217;s overall audit strategy for significant audit risks identified by them; and the nature and extent of the specialized skills necessary to perform the planned audit. We have established procedures to receive and track the handling of issues regarding accounting and reporting, internal control and auditing matters. In addition, we monitor the audit, audit-related and tax services provided by PwC. The Audit Committee has also evaluated and concluded that audit-related and tax services provided by PwC do not impair PwC&#8217;s independence. Details of the fees paid to PwC for its services, as well as the Audit Committee&#8217;s &#8220;pre-approval policy&#8221; for such services, can be found on page 80 . Assessment of PwC The Audit Committee annually evaluates PwC&#8217;s qualifications, performance and independence in connection with its determination as to whether to retain PwC. In conducting our evaluation we considered, among other things: &#8226; the professional qualifications of PwC, and that of the lead audit partner, quality review partner and other key engagement&#160;partners; &#8226; PwC&#8217;s current and historical performance on the Firm&#8217;s audit, including the extent and quality of its communications with the Audit Committee and the Firm&#8217;s&#160;management related to accounting and auditing issues, legislative and regulatory developments impacting financial institutions as well as industry insights, trends and emerging practices; &#8226; PwC&#8217;s demonstrated professional skepticism and objectivity, including fresh perspectives brought through the required periodic rotation of the lead audit partner, the quality review partner and other partners who play a significant role in the audit engagement; &#8226; PwC&#8217;s demonstrated capability, expertise and efficiency in which it navigates the breadth and complexity of the Firm&#8217;s global operations, including the use of technology, specialists, and subject matter experts; &#8226; PwC&#8217;s depth of institutional knowledge and understanding of the Firm&#8217;s global businesses, operations and systems, the financial services industry, including the global regulatory environment, U.S. and international accounting standards, the potential effect on the financial statements of the significant risks and exposures facing the Firm, and the Firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting; &#8226; external data relating to PwC&#8217;s audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on PwC (including its global network of firms), and the results of peer review and self-review examinations; &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 81 Table of Contents Audit matters &#160;&#160; |&#160; &#160; Audit Committee report &#8226; an analysis of PwC&#8217;s known legal risks and significant proceedings that could impair PwC&#8217;s ability to perform the Firm&#8217;s annual audit; &#8226; PwC&#8217;s tenure as the Firm&#8217;s independent auditor; &#8226; the appropriateness of PwC&#8217;s fees, both on an absolute basis and as compared with fees paid by certain peer banking firms;&#160;and &#8226; the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm, including the additional costs and inefficiencies associated with hiring a new independent registered public accounting&#160;firm. PwC provided us the written disclosures and the letter required by PCAOB&#8217;s Ethics and Independence Rule&#160;3526, Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence. After discussions, we confirmed with PwC their&#160;independence. As a result of this evaluation, we believe PwC has the capability to provide the necessary expertise, independence and professional skepticism to continue to audit the Firm&#8217;s businesses, and we approved the appointment of PwC as JPMorganChase&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for 2025, subject to shareholder ratification. Management is responsible for the Firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting, the financial reporting process and JPMorganChase&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements. PwC is responsible for performing an independent audit of JPMorganChase&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements and of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the PCAOB. The Firm&#8217;s Internal Audit function, under the direction of the General Auditor, is independent of the Firm&#8217;s businesses and the Independent Risk Management function. Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee (and administratively to the Firm&#8217;s CEO) and is responsible for preparing an annual audit plan and conducting internal audits intended to independently test and evaluate the Firm&#8217;s governance, risk management and internal controls. The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing; as noted above, the Audit Committee&#8217;s responsibility is to monitor and oversee&#160;these&#160;processes. The Audit Committee regularly meets and holds discussions&#160;with the Firm&#8217;s management, internal auditors and with PwC, and also holds private sessions with the General Auditor and with PwC, without members of management present. These discussions include issues encountered during the audit, the Firm&#8217;s quarterly earnings materials, and Quarterly and Annual Reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, prior to filing with the SEC; as well as actions the Audit Committee has taken during the prior&#160;year. Management represented to us that JPMorganChase&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). We reviewed and discussed JPMorganChase&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements with management, the General Auditor and PwC. We also reviewed and discussed with PwC the quality of the Firm&#8217;s significant accounting principles, the reasonableness of critical accounting estimates and judgments, critical audit matters PwC identified during the audit, and the disclosures in JPMorganChase&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements, including disclosures relating to significant accounting policies. We relied, without independent verification, on the information provided to us and on the representations made by management, internal auditors and the independent auditor. Based on our review of the reports given to us by PwC and our discussions with the Firm&#8217;s management, internal auditors and PwC, as well as their respective representations to us, we recommended to the Board, and&#160;the Board approved, inclusion of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2024 Annual Report&#160;on Form 10-K, as filed with the&#160;SEC. March 17, 2025 Audit Committee Mark A. Weinberger (Chair) Michele Buck Alex Gorsky Phebe N. Novakovic 82 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Shareholder proposals 1 : RECOMMENDATION: Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals, if&#160;presented Introduction 84 PROPOSAL 4 : Support for an i ndependent bo ard c hairman 85 PROPOSAL 5 : Report on s ocial i mpacts of t ransition f inance 88 1 The names, addresses and beneficial holdings of the proponents and any co-sponsors to a proposal are available to shareholders upon request by writing to the Secretary at the address listed on page 96 . &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 83 Table of Contents Shareholder proposals Introduction Proposals 4 and 5 have been submitted by shareholders and will be voted on if properly presented at the 2025 Annual Meeting. The shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear in the form they were submitted to us. Our Board and senior management spend a significant amount of time considering each shareholder proposal the Firm receives, engaging with the proponents to better understand their views, assessing the relevance of the subject matter to our business, considering the opinions of other shareholders to prioritize shareholder views and considering the potential costs and benefits of the request. The Board&#8217;s focus is on its fiduciary duty, namely, advancing the long-term financial interests of the Firm&#8217;s&#160;shareholders. Consistent with recent trends we&#8217;ve observed, some proposals the Firm receives do not explain how they promote shareholders&#8217; interests or even assert that they do. Some proposals provide no empirical evidence of financial effectiveness; some propose solutions without identifying a failure, material problem, or historical significant risk at the Firm and also ask the Firm to adopt practices that are not common among our peers; and still others are based on assertions about the Firm that we believe are inaccurate and misleading. There is meaningful cost attached to the implementation of each shareholder proposal. For instance, one proposal requests preparation of a report. In 2024, the Firm published a number of reports, including an ESG Report and a Climate Report, on topics that we have determined to be of interest to a broad base of shareholders and other stakeholders. Each of these reports require considerable time and resources to produce, including senior management time and attention. Creating additional and potentially duplicative reports is not a good use of resources, particularly when, based on our assessment, interest in the topic is&#160;limited. After a thorough evaluation, taking into account the potential costs, benefits, and alignment with our shareholders&#8217; long-term financial interests, as well as the themes addressed in the proposals, the Board strongly recommends a vote AGAINST each of the shareholder proposals presented within this proxy statement. We firmly believe in the value of shareholder engagement and recognize that our shareholders hold diverse views and perspectives on various issues. While the Board recommends votes AGAINST these proposals, we remain open to continued engagement with the proponents and others who share our commitment to the long-term value of JPMorganChase. 84 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Shareholder proposals PROPOSAL 4: Support for an independent board chairman John Chevedden has advised us that he intends to introduce the following resolution: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an enduring policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary in order that 2 separate people hold the office of the Chairman and the office of the CEO as follows: Selection of the Chairman of the Board The Board requires the separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Whenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an Independent Director. The Board has the discretion to select a Temporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent Director to serve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the Board on an accelerated basis. It is a best practice to adopt this proposal soon. However this policy could be phased in when there is a contract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition. This proposal topic won 47%-support at the 2021 JPM annual meeting. It takes much more JPM shareholder conviction of the merits of this proposal to vote for this shareholder proposal than to reflexively vote according to the JPM Board of Directors instructions. There are at least 2 ways 47%-support can be considered a 50%+ majority vote at JPM. This 47% vote was especially impressive because this proposal had to swim upstream against repeated Madison Avenue type special solicitations sent to the JPM shareholders who have no access to independent proxy voting advice. The 47% also represented a 50%+ majority vote from professional investors who had access to independent proxy voting advice. Any proposal that gets above 45% support has to get a majority vote from the most informed shares because there is an overwhelming abundance of automatic against votes from the JPM shares that have no access to independent proxy voting advice. The Board of Directors disingenuously put forth a deceptive policy, to dupe shareholders who have no access to independent proxy voting advice, that said JPM could always have one person fill the 2 most important jobs at JPM as long as the JPM directors gave almost any excuse to violate the policy. Putting forth a deceptive policy is worse than taking no action at all in response to a JPM shareholder proposal. JPM also needs to take the role of the lead director seriously. JPM's so-called Lead Director violates the most important attribute of a Lead Director &#8212; independence. As director tenure goes up director independence goes down. The JPM lead director has 21-years director tenure. The JPM lead director may be close to setting a record for long-tenure by a lead director. And the JPM so-called lead director was the target of 186 million against votes at the 2024 JPM annual meeting. Please vote yes: Support for an Independent Board Chairman &#8212; Proposal 4 &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 85 Table of Contents Shareholder proposals Board response to proposal 4 The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote&#160; AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: &#8226; Outstanding long-term performance does not happen without exceptional leadership. Under the current leadership structure, the Firm continues to grow its business, improve its products and services and lift up communities. As described throughout this proxy statement, this structure has allowed for effective execution on strategic priorities. &#8226; The proposal calls for a mandatory, enduring, and inflexible policy on leadership structure but presents absolutely no evidence that a policy to maintain a separate CEO and Chair leadership structure serves the best interests of the Firm and its shareholders. In fact, this underlying assumption is contradicted by the practices of the majority of the largest U.S. public companies and the Firm&#8217;s consistent financial outperformance under its current leadership structure. &#8226; Determining the optimal Board leadership structure is crucial for fulfilling the Board's fiduciary duty to shareholders. The Board conducts an annual evaluation of its leadership structure, leveraging its experience, judgment, boardroom insight, and ongoing shareholder feedback to make informed decisions. Historically, the Board has separated the Chair and CEO roles in half of the Firm&#8217;s last six management transitions and is considering doing so again in the upcoming transition. This flexibility demonstrates the Board's commitment to adapting its leadership structure to best serve the Firm's interests, effectively discharging its fiduciary responsibilities. &#8226; The proposal fails to recognize the robustness of the Firm&#8217;s Lead Independent Director role which is empowered to serve as a strong counterbalance to the CEO and exercises independent authority. In fact, the current Lead Independent Director has been particularly effective at guiding the Board&#8217;s responsiveness to shareholder concerns, reflected in the consistently high shareholder support received by our Lead Independent Director during his tenure in the role. We have received similar proposals for multiple years, but we, and a majority of our shareholders, continue to disagree with the prescriptive proposal. In 2024, the Firm reported another record year of strong returns alongside future investment, maintained its fortress balance sheet, and strengthened controls. The proposal lacks empirical evidence that a separate CEO/Chair leadership structure is superior for the shareholders of our company. Further, the proposal does not acknowledge the exceptional outperformance of the company while Mr. Dimon has held both roles, and it does not recognize the effectiveness of our independent Lead Director and independent Board, for JPMorganChase. There is no consensus on a single ideal leadership structure for all companies, as evidenced by the proponent's lack of empirical support. However, a clear "market practice" exists among our peers; a market practice study shows the majority of the 100 largest U.S. public companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have a combined CEO and Chair role, and approximately 30% of the minority of those companies with separate roles do not have an independent chair. The Board of Directors remains in the best position to determine the appropriate structure of its leadership at any given time. More importantly, our Board is not fixed in its view of whether the Firm is best served by a combined or separated Chair/CEO function &#8211; in fact, it has separated the Chair and CEO roles in half of the Firm&#8217;s six previous management transitions, and it currently contemplates doing so again in the next transition. This demonstrates its ability to effectively discharge its fiduciary duties with respect to leadership structure. The Board has also implemented strong governance of this assessment, by requiring an annual review of leadership structure. Each year the Board considers, among other factors, the composition of the Board, the individuals serving in leadership positions and their performance, the needs and opportunities of the Firm at the time, the Firm&#8217;s long-term performance and shareholder feedback. This proposal would eliminate the Board&#8217;s ability to use its experience, judgment, boardroom insight, and ongoing shareholder feedback to make the most informed decision on its own leadership structure based on current facts and circumstances &#8212; and may require structures that do not best serve our shareholders. Contrary to its request for a mandatory, enduring, and inflexible policy on leadership structure, the proposal actually supports Board judgment by providing for the Board&#8217;s discretion in appointing a non-independent &#8220;Temporary Chairman&#8221; while it seeks an independent Chair. It is unclear what the proponent intends in suggesting that the Board appoint a &#8220;Temporary Chairman&#8221; &#8212; this is not a standard corporate governance practice and would undermine the authority of the role of the Chair. However, this feature serves to demonstrate why an inflexible policy is inconsistent with good practice and shareholder value. 86 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Shareholder proposals The proposal also makes several inaccurate statements that may mislead shareholders. It claims there are ways in which a 2021 proposal on this topic, which received 47% support, may be deemed to have received majority support. The proposal did not, in fact, receive majority support. Nonetheless, the Board responded to support garnered by the proposal in 2021 by enhancing our Corporate Governance Principles to separate the Chair and CEO positions at the next CEO transition, subject to the Board&#8217;s determination of the leadership structure that best serves the Firm and its shareholders at that time. Further, the proponent asserts that the Board&#8217;s adoption of a general policy to separate the Chair and CEO roles at the next CEO transition was somehow intended to deceive shareholders. These statements are demonstrably false. The Board has been clear that it believes a mandatory or &#8220;enduring&#8221; policy that requires a separate Independent Chair undermines its discretion to respond to shareholder feedback and use its experience, judgment, and boardroom insight to make the best-informed decision about leadership at the time and has consistently recommended against adoption of such a policy. The Board has also been transparent regarding its amendment of the Corporate Governance Principles in 2022. We disclosed this amendment &#8212; and the Board&#8217;s rationale &#8212; in our 2022 proxy statement and have disclosed this policy in each of our annual proxy statements since 2022. The Corporate Governance Principles are also available publicly on our website. In addition, the proponent incorrectly asserts that our Lead Independent Director, Stephen B. Burke, is not independent and states the Board does not take this role seriously. Mr. Burke is independent under New York Stock Exchange rules and the Board&#8217;s independence standards which are described in the Firm&#8217;s Corporate Governance Principles (see p. 18 of this proxy statement for further information). In addition, Mr. Burke&#8217;s service on the Board has allowed him to gain invaluable institutional knowledge, making him extremely effective as Lead Independent Director. He has been overwhelmingly supported by shareholders, receiving more than 90% of shareholder votes for each election during his tenure as Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director role is empowered to serve as a strong and effective counterbalance and thought partner to the CEO. Contrary to the claims of this proposal, the Lead Independent Director role includes robust responsibilities and independent authority, including the facilitation of independent oversight of management and promotion of open dialogue among independent directors during Board meetings, at executive sessions without the presence of the CEO, and in between Board meetings. It should also be noted that each member of the Board except for Mr. Dimon is independent. The Board meets separately from Mr. Dimon at every regularly scheduled meeting and provides direct feedback to him afterward. A simple majority of the Board can remove Mr. Dimon as CEO at any time for any reason. Mr. Dimon has no contract and serves at the pleasure of the Board. Outstanding long-term performance does not happen without exceptional leadership. Under the current leadership structure, the Firm continues to grow its business, improve its products and services and lift up communities. As described throughout this proxy statement, this structure has allowed for effective execution on strategic priorities. Under Mr. Dimon's leadership as Chair and CEO, overseen by an otherwise independent Board and Lead Independent Director, the Firm has delivered ROTCE that has consistently outperformed our major competitors, demonstrating effective oversight and leadership achieved through a combined structure. The Board of Directors recommends a vote&#160; AGAINST this proposal. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 87 Table of Contents Shareholder proposals PROPOSAL 5: Report on social impacts of transition finance Paul Rissman has advised us that he intends to introduce the following resolution: RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) issue a report disclosing whether and how the Company addresses the potential risks and opportunities related to the social impacts of JPM&#8217;s transition finance efforts. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Transition finance 1 &#8212; financial support that helps decarbonize high-emitting activities or enables the decarbonization of other economic activities, is an important aspect of JPM&#8217;s business. JPM&#8217;s Center for Carbon Transition &#8220;is a key business within J.P. Morgan's Corporate Advisory&#8221; and assists its Commercial and Investment Bank &#8220;on a wide variety of strategic sustainability-focused transactions.&#8221; 2 JPM states that it has a $1 trillion Green objective, of which $242 billion has already been financed or facilitated. 3 Managing the human element of this massive climate transition appears as important as technical innovation or development of new physical infrastructure. Stranded human capital and human rights abuses can generate public resistance to the transition; in contrast, investment in the retraining of people, and demonstrating respect and partnership with communities can ease and accelerate the transition. Whether coal miners losing their jobs in Appalachia or land use and pollution conflict in communities targeted for lithium mining, climate transition faces backlash where the human element is ignored. 4 A study of the Environmental Justice Atlas database found that one quarter of projects opposed by environmental defenders were stopped through protest, litigation and other forms of popular mobilization. 5 According to the World Economic Forum (WEF) 6 &#8220;[t]he green transition&#8230; could concentrate job creation in already tight labour markets&#8230; deepen[ing] unemployment in some regions while causing labour shortages in others&#8230;&#8221; WEF notes that this &#8220;could fuel social and political upheaval.&#8221; Thus, part of the work of transition finance is to support finance, public policy or other provisions for worker transition such as job retraining and skill development, income support in job transitions, creating new green jobs, and actively planning for economic diversification in affected communities. The rights of communities are also at stake, such as in regions where mining of minerals critical to the green transition threatens human rights and the environment. Transition strategies must respect human rights, public health and the environment, or they risk community resistance and supply chain disruption. Unfortunately, there is precious little in JPM&#8217;s disclosures on this topic. References to mitigating negative impacts appear in its 2023 Development Finance Institution Annual Report and Methodology, which apply to any type of emerging markets investments, but not specifically to transition finance. Otherwise, disclosure concerning the social risks and opportunities of transition finance is absent in JPM&#8217;s financial and sustainability reports, in contrast to its peer banks. 7 This is doubly concerning as JPM&#8217;s &#8220;Green Progress&#8221; financing and facilitation has declined from 2022 to 2023. 8 JPM&#8217;s inadequate disclosure impairs investors&#8217; ability to understand how its transition finance plans safeguard shareholder returns. 1 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/01/davos23-transition-finance-decarbonization/ 2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.jpmorgan.com/investment-banking/center-for-carbon-transition 3 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/Climate-Report-2024.pdf 4 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421518302301 5 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020301424?via%3Dihub 6 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000pTDXEA2/key-issues/a1Gb00000015QJKEA2 7 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.iccr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ICCR-The-Role-of-Major-US-Banks-in-a-Just-Transition-to-a-Net-Zero-Carbon-Economy-FINAL.pdf 8 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/documents/Climate-Report-2024.pdf 88 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Shareholder proposals Board response to proposal 5 The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote&#160; AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: &#8226; JPMorganChase works to advance sustainable community development, recognizing that healthy communities are important to our business success. &#8226; The social factors referenced by the proponent are generally not driven by unique environmental attributes. Instead, actions to address climate change are often one influence among many in social factors that are more appropriately addressed through public policy. &#8226; Applying an artificially narrow focus to our assessment of environmental and social ("E&amp;S") matters would limit our ability to understand and address the social factors that are relevant to our business. &#8226; There is currently no universally accepted definition of &#8220;transition finance&#8221; in the market, which creates ambiguity and potential misrepresentation. Therefore, providing such disclosure without a clear standard could mislead investors rather than inform them, undermining the very transparency we aim to achieve. At JPMorganChase, our objective is to manage our business and associated risks in a manner that balances serving the interests of our clients, customers, and investors while safeguarding the Firm's safety and soundness. The world today faces significant environmental and social challenges, which, if not adequately addressed, could pose risks to society and businesses alike. Assessing our clients&#8217; approach to and performance on E&amp;S matters is a crucial component of risk management at JPMorganChase. Inadequate management of E&amp;S risks can impact our clients&#8217; operations and long-term economic viability, increase scrutiny from investors, employees, and regulators, and affect the environment and communities globally. We recognize that climate change and efforts to address it are complex, broad social and economic implications. We take these considerations seriously. However, these effects are not unique to climate change and are similar to those from other sources. This is why we adopt a holistic approach to assessing E&amp;S matters, as we do with other risks. Many issues raised by the proponent stem from macroeconomic trends arising from a complex set of interlocking factors. While JPMorganChase may share these concerns, they are more appropriately addressed directly through public policy. Communities and labor forces worldwide face diverse social challenges and opportunities that cannot be analyzed in isolation. A narrow focus on &#8220;transition finance&#8221; may hinder a comprehensive understanding of broader social challenges and opportunities. For instance, understanding labor dynamics would be incomplete if focused solely on transition finance, excluding other factors. The job creation and displacement on which the proponent focuses can occur for many intersecting reasons, including automation, artificial intelligence, deglobalization of supply chains, evolution of consumer demand, or changes in public policy. While efforts to address climate change may create jobs today, this job creation is generally driven by a broad set of factors such as innovation, new infrastructure construction, consumer demand evolution, or the growth of new sectors. We have frameworks to identify client business models with high concentrations of specific environmental and social risks that pose the highest potential impact to the Firm. Client and transaction decisions consider these frameworks as well as various other client-specific factors, including a client&#8217;s track record and engagement in resolving identified issues. We continue to invest in talent, data and technology resources to support the management of climate, nature, and social risks. The Firm provides extensive disclosure regarding its approach to environmental, climate change, and social issues in its suite of annual reporting, including our most recent Climate Report, ESG Report, regulatory filings, website, press releases, and various other reports and presentations. Additional disclosure related to transition finance is unnecessary. Furthermore, the scope of &#8220;transition finance&#8221; is unclear. There is no universally accepted definition of &#8220;transition finance&#8221; in the market, making it unclear what specific activities would be included in additional disclosure, the utility of additional disclosure, or the risk of potential misrepresentation that, given the lack of a clear standard, could mislead investors rather than inform them, undermining the very transparency we aim to achieve. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 89 Table of Contents Shareholder proposals Recognizing the Firm&#8217;s existing suite of disclosure, independent approach to business decisions, the unclear utility of narrowly focusing on &#8220;transition finance&#8221; in the market, and the Firm&#8217;s broader efforts to advance community development, the Board recommends voting against this proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote&#160; AGAINST this proposal. 90 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Information about the annual meeting of shareholders General Why am I receiving these materials?

How are shares voted? All shares represented by valid ballots or valid proxies received prior to the taking of the vote at the annual meeting will be voted. If you do not vote at the annual meeting, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your shares as you have instructed. How will my shares be voted if I do not give specific voting instructions? Shareholder of Record: If you are a shareholder of record and do not return a proxy card, or if you sign, date and return a proxy card but do not give specific voting instructions, then the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement. In addition, the proxies may determine in their discretion how to vote your shares regarding any other matters properly presented for a vote at our annual&#160;meeting. Although our Board does not anticipate that any of the director nominees will be unable to stand for election as a director nominee at our annual meeting, if this occurs, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your shares in favor of such other person or persons as may be recommended by our Governance Committee and designated by the Board. Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and the organization holding your shares does not receive specific voting instructions from you, how your shares may be voted will depend on whether the proposal is considered &#8220;routine&#8221; or &#8220;non-routine,&#8221; as described below. Participants in the 401(k) Savings Plan: The trustee of the JPMorganChase 401(k) Savings Plan (&#8220;Plan&#8221;) will vote the shares held in the Common Stock Fund as of the Record Date. If you have an interest in the JPMorganChase Common Stock Fund through the Plan, your vote will provide voting instructions to the trustee. If no voting instructions are given, the trustee will vote uninstructed shares in the same proportion as voted shares. Which proposals are considered &#8220;routine&#8221; or &#8220;non-routine&#8221;? The ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is considered to be a &#8220;routine&#8221; matter under NYSE rules. A bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization may generally vote in their discretion on routine matters, if specific voting instructions are not received from a beneficial owner. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 93 Table of Contents Information about the annual meeting of shareholders All other proposals are considered &#8220;non-routine&#8221; under NYSE rules and are therefore &#8220;non-discretionary&#8221; matters. This means your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization may not vote your shares without instructions from you. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote on one of these non-routine matters, it will so inform the inspector of election. This is generally referred to as a &#8220;broker non-vote.&#8221; What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? Shareholder of Record: If your shares of JPMorganChase common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a &#8220;shareholder of record&#8221; of those shares. Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name: If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name. In that case, you will have received these proxy materials, as well as a voting instruction form, from the organization holding your shares and, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct the organization as to how to vote them. Most individual shareholders are beneficial owners of shares held in street&#160;name. What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? Quorum Requirement: Before any business can be transacted at our annual meeting, a quorum must be present. Holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting, present at the meeting or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are treated as present for quorum purposes. Requirements for each proposal: What is the voting requirement for each proposal? Proposal Voting options Vote requirement Effect of abstentions 1 Effect of broker non- votes 2 Corporate governance: &#8211; Election of directors 3 FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN (for each director nominee) Majority of the votes cast FOR or AGAINST (for each director&#160;nominee) No effect &#8212; not counted as a vote cast No effect &#8212; not entitled to&#160;vote Executive compensation: &#8211; Advisory vote on compensation 4 FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN Majority of the shares present or represented by&#160;proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal Counts as a vote AGAINST No effect &#8212; not entitled to&#160;vote Audit matters: Ratification of independent auditor FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN Majority of the shares present or represented by&#160;proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal Counts as a vote AGAINST N/A &#8212; the organization that holds shares of beneficial owners may vote in their&#160;discretion Shareholder proposals: Voting requirements for each proposal are the same FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN Majority of the shares present or represented by&#160;proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal Counts as a vote AGAINST No effect &#8212; not entitled to&#160;vote 1 For election of directors, abstentions have no effect because the required vote is determined as follows: votes FOR divided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes AGAINST. For all other proposals (management and shareholder), abstentions are counted as a vote AGAINST the proposal because the required vote is determined as follows: votes FOR divided by the sum of votes FOR plus votes AGAINST plus votes&#160;ABSTAINING. 2 For all proposals (management and shareholder) other than ratification of the independent auditor, broker non-votes have no effect because they are not considered shares entitled to vote on the proposal. 3 If, in a non-contested election of directors, an incumbent nominee for director is not re-elected by a majority of votes cast, such nominee must tender their resignation, and the Board of Directors, through a process managed by the Governance Committee, will decide whether to accept the resignation at its next regular meeting. Unless the Board decides to reject the offer or to postpone the effective date, the resignation shall become effective 45 days after the date of the election. 4 The result of the advisory vote on compensation is not binding on the Board, whether or not the resolution is passed under the standard described above. 94 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Information about the annual meeting of shareholders Is my vote confidential? Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. JPMorganChase will not disclose the proxy instructions or ballots of individual shareholders except to those recording the vote, or as may be required in accordance with appropriate legal process, or as authorized by the&#160;shareholder. Could other matters be decided at the 2025 annual meeting? We do not know of any matters that will be considered at the annual meeting other than those described above. If a shareholder proposal that was properly excluded from this proxy statement or is otherwise not properly presented at the meeting is nevertheless brought before the meeting, the Chair will declare such a proposal out of order, and it will be disregarded. If any other matters arise at the annual meeting that are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will be voted at the discretion of the proxy holders. What happens if the meeting is postponed or&#160;adjourned? Your proxy will still be good and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted. Who counts the votes cast at our annual&#160;meeting? Representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes cast at our annual meeting, and American Election Services, LLC will act as the independent inspector of&#160;election. Where can I find the voting results of our annual meeting? We expect to announce the preliminary voting results at our annual meeting. The final voting results will be reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed&#160;with the SEC and be available on our website. Who is paying the costs of this proxy&#160;solicitation? JPMorganChase is paying the costs of the solicitation of proxies. JPMorganChase has retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies from brokerage firms, banks, broker-dealers and other similar organizations representing beneficial owners of shares. We have agreed to pay MacKenzie Partners a fee of approximately $55,000 plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses. JPMorganChase must also pay brokerage firms, banks, broker-dealers and other similar organizations representing beneficial owners certain fees associated with: &#8226; Forwarding the Notice of Internet Availability to beneficial&#160;owners; &#8226; Forwarding printed proxy materials by mail to beneficial owners who specifically request them; and &#8226; Obtaining beneficial owners&#8217; voting instructions. In addition to solicitations by mail, the persons who will be serving as the proxies and JPMorganChase&#8217;s directors, officers and employees may solicit, without additional compensation, proxies on JPMorganChase&#8217;s behalf in person, by phone or by electronic&#160;communication. How do I inspect the list of shareholders of&#160;record? A list of shareholders of record as of March&#160;21, 2025 will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at our offices at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179, from May 9, 2025, to May 19, 2025. Please contact the Office of the Secretary by sending an email to corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com if you wish to inspect the list prior to the annual meeting. &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 95 Table of Contents Information about the annual meeting of shareholders Information about paper and electronic delivery of proxy materials JPMorganChase uses the SEC rule commonly known as &#8220;Notice and Access&#8221; that permits companies to furnish proxy materials to our shareholders over the Internet. This process enables us to expedite delivery of materials to our shareholders and reduces the costs to us of printing and mailing paper proxy materials. In accordance with the Notice and Access rules, on or about April&#160;7, 2025, we sent those current shareholders of record on March&#160;21, 2025, the Record Date for the annual meeting, a Notice. The Notice contains instructions on how to access our proxy statement and annual report online. If you received a Notice, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the&#160;mail. If you received a Notice, and would like to receive copies of our proxy materials in print by mail, or electronically by email, please follow the instructions in the Notice. Shareholders who do not receive the Notice will receive copies of our proxy statement and 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders either by mail or email. The copies will be sent on or about April&#160;7, 2025. How can I obtain an additional proxy card? Shareholders of record can contact the Office of the Secretary by sending an email to corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com or calling (212) 270-6000. If you hold your shares of common stock in street name, contact your account representative at the bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or similar organization through which you hold your shares. How do I sign up for electronic delivery of proxy materials? This proxy statement and our 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders are available on our website at: jpmorganchase.com. If you would like to help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings and our costs of printing and mailing future materials, you can agree to access these documents in the future over the Internet rather than receiving printed copies in the mail. For your convenience, you may find links to sign up for electronic delivery for both shareholders of record and beneficial owners who hold shares in street name at https://enroll.icsdelivery.com/jpm. Once you sign up, you will continue to receive proxy materials electronically until you revoke this preference. I share an address with another shareholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials. How can I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials? JPMorganChase has adopted a procedure called &#8220;householding.&#8221; Under this procedure, JPMorganChase may deliver a single copy of the proxy statement and annual report to multiple shareholders who share the same address, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. Each shareholder continues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure reduces the environmental impact of our annual meetings and our printing and mailing costs. If your household received a single set of proxy materials, but you prefer to receive a separate copy of the proxy statement and 2024 Annual Report, you may contact the Office of the Secretary via email at corporate.secretary@jpmchase.com, via mail at the Office of the Secretary, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., 383 Madison Avenue, 39th Floor, New York, New York 10179, or by phone at 212-270-6000 and these documents will be delivered to you promptly upon receiving the request. Alternatively, if you are receiving more than one copy of the proxy materials at a single address and would like to participate in householding, please contact Broadridge Financial Services at 1-866-540-7095. If you are a beneficial owner who holds shares&#160;in street name, contact your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or similar organization to request information about&#160;householding. You may change your householding preferences at any time, by contacting Broadridge Financial Services at 1-866-540-7095 or by sending a written request to Broadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, or by contacting the bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or similar organization through which you hold your shares. 96 2025 Proxy Statement &#160; Table of Contents Information about the annual meeting of shareholders Other How do I obtain more information about JPMorganChase?

Tribolati Secretary &#160; 2025 Proxy Statement 99 Table of Contents Notes on non-GAAP financial&#160;measures 1. TCE, ROTCE, TBVPS and Pre-tax income ex. LLR are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm&#8217;s common stockholders&#8217; equity (i.e., total stockholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm&#8217;s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm&#8217;s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Pre-tax income ex. LLR represents income on a managed basis before income tax expense (pre-tax income) excluding the change in loan loss reserves. This reflects the exclusion of the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm&#8217;s use of equity. Pre-tax income ex. LLR is utilized by the Firm to assess the Firm&#8217;s operating performance and management believes this information helps investors understand the effect on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm&#8217;s performance. The following tables provide reconciliations and calculations of these measures for the periods presented. 2. In addition to analyzing the Firm&#8217;s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis. The Firm&#8217;s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
