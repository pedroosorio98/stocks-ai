Profitability $4.4B GAAP operating income in 2025; $1.4B in Q4 $3.8B GAAP net income in 2025; $0.8B in Q4 $5.9B non-GAAP net income1 in 2025; $1.8B in Q4 2025 marked a critical year for Tesla as we further expanded our mission and continued our transition from a hardware-centric business to a physical AI company. We laid the foundation for the future of Tesla as we further advanced FSD (Supervised)4, launched our Robotaxi service, began installing production lines for Cybercab and fine-tuned our production-primed Optimus design while expanding our AI training infrastructure. Our approach to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots mirrors the way we approached electric vehicles and energy storage – at the system level where we identify the limiting factor and develop bespoke and scalable solutions (batteries, power electronics, inverters, software, AI silicon, etc.) to optimize for cost, functionality, efficiency and safety. Our vertical integration has enabled us to achieve economies of scale in a profitable manner, quickly troubleshoot bottlenecks in production and iteratively optimize our technologies more rapidly than others. In 2025, we completed the refresh of our vehicle lineup with the launch of the new Model Y, including additional variants. We believe that maintaining an optimized and efficient product portfolio, with a continued focus on high-value features such as long range, best-in-class software and autonomy, is the correct strategy to win the autos market of the future. Similarly, we continued to evolve our energy offerings for commercial, utility and retail customers, as we position ourselves as a supplier of choice for clean, affordable and rapidly deployable energy capacity ahead of expected sustained demand growth for electricity. In 2026, we will further invest in the infrastructure needed to support clean energy and transport and autonomous robots, including the ramp of six new production lines across vehicle, robots, energy storage and battery manufacturing, while further leveraging our existing factory, charging and service center footprint to support future growth.

Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. Construction includes factory and infrastructure buildout as well as tool installation. Automotive While automotive sales declined sequentially, gross margin (even when excluding the impact of regulatory credits) improved. The APAC region continued to show strength across multiple markets and set a record for deliveries in the quarter. We continued the rollout of Model Y variants across markets in Q4, including the standard and performance versions. Preparations continue in North America for the production ramps of Tesla Semi and Cybercab, both commencing 1H26, and production of the next-generation Roadster. Energy generation and storage We achieved our highest quarterly energy storage deployments, driven by record Megapack deployments. Total gross profit rose, both sequentially and year-over-year, to a record $1.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive record quarter. We plan to begin Megapack 3 and Megablock production at Megafactory Houston in 2026. In 2025, our global Powerwall network supported more than 89,000 Virtual Power Plant events across over 1 million installed units, allowing homeowners to save over $1 billion in electricity bills as Virtual Power Plant participation continues to scale rapidly. Robotics We made further progress on the Optimus program in 2025. In Q1 of this year, we plan to unveil the Gen 3 version of Optimus, which will include major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design. The Gen 3 is our first design meant for mass production. Preparations are underway for the first production line, including supply chain readiness, with start of production planned before the end of 2026 and eventual planned capacity of 1 million robots per year. 8 S U P P O R T I N G I N F R A S T R U C T U R E Installed Annual Capacity Region Product Capacity Status AI Training Compute Texas Cortex 1 >100k H100e Production Cortex 2 - Construction Battery Manufacturing Nevada LFP 7 GWh Early Ramp Texas 4680 40 GWh Production Cathode Materials 10 GWh Early Ramp Lithium Refining 30 GWh Early Ramp Installed capacity ≠ current production rate and there may be limitations discovered as production rates approach capacity. Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. Construction includes factory and infrastructure buildout as well as tool installation. AI Training Compute We are currently building Cortex 2 at Gigafactory Texas to further increase our AI training compute capacity. In the first half of 2026, we plan to more than double the size of onsite compute in Texas (in terms of H100 equivalents). We aim to maximize capital efficiency by scaling training compute judiciously, including when the training backlog gets too long or in anticipation of greater demand from our engineers to support our AI-related offerings. Battery Our lithium refinery commenced pilot production and is the first spodumene to lithium hydroxide refinery in North America, leveraging a simpler, cheaper and more environmentally friendly process. This refinery enables us to domestically produce critical minerals in support of energy storage, battery manufacturing and ultimately for EV growth. We have begun to produce battery packs for certain Model Ys with our 4680 cells, unlocking an additional vector of supply to help navigate increasingly complex supply chain challenges caused by trade barriers and tariff risks. We now produce dry-electrode for 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin. We expect both domestic cathode material in Texas and LFP lines in Nevada to begin production in 2026. Other Supporting Infrastructure We continue to efficiently utilize our existing physical footprint in North America, with targeted augmentation to support the rollout of Robotaxi. While in the short-term, operational workstreams such as charging, cleaning and maintenance can be managed through our existing charging network, service centers and sales and delivery locations, we will have to add more capacity as the service expands. We added over 3,800 net new Supercharging stalls, growing the network 19% year-over-year. 9 Tesla AI Training Capacity Ramp (H100 equivalent GPUs) 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 Existing Capacity Future Planned Capacity Targeting Step-Function Improvement for our Next-Generation Inference Chip, AI5 A I & S O F T W A R E Cumulative Miles Driven with FSD (Supervised)1 (billions) AI Software We continue to enhance FSD (Supervised)1 via our end-to-end foundation model trained on both customer and Robotaxi real-world data with our latest version, v14. FSD (Supervised)1 increasingly provides safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, including giving access to personal transport for those who otherwise have difficulty driving. V14 offers unparalleled driver assistance to safely drive to the customer’s destination, find a free parking spot and park at that location. Our global fleet can collect the equivalent of over 500 years of continuous driving data per day2, allowing us to safely deploy and scale capabilities that can handle the long and fat tail of corner cases across diverse geographies and driving environments. AI Inference Compute Development of our in-house, custom designed AI5 and AI6 inference chips for autonomy progressed during the quarter, with production planned for 2027 and 2028, respectively. We are targeting a 50x improvement in performance for AI5 relative to AI4 thanks to 10x raw compute, 9x memory capacity and 5x hardened block quantization and softmax function (the latter enabling efficient low-precision computing without sacrificing model accuracy). Automotive and Other Software The Robotaxi iOS app no longer has a waitlist in the areas we serve. Our vehicles keep getting better with our over-the-air updates, including: Grok (an AI companion) which now supports navigation commands (allowing users to find, add and edit navigation destinations hands-free); Tesla Photobooth which enables users to take photos in their car and download or share via the Tesla mobile app; Supercharger Site Maps which displays Supercharger layouts, nearby businesses and live availability details; Automatic HOV Lane Routing based on interior camera occupancy detection; Phone Left Behind Chime and SpaceX ISS Docking Simulator Game. 10 (1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous (2) Calculated based on continuous hours of driving at an average of 30 miles per hour 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 FSD Miles on V12 and Beyond FSD Miles on V11 and Before S E R V I C E S Planned Robotaxi Coverage Cumulative Paid Robotaxi Miles 11 State Metro Status California SF Bay Area Safety Driver Texas Austin Ramping Unsupervised Dallas 1H 2026 Houston 1H 2026 Arizona Phoenix 1H 2026 Florida Miami 1H 2026 Orlando 1H 2026 Tampa 1H 2026 Nevada Las Vegas 1H 2026 0 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 600,000 700,000 (1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous. Robotaxi We began testing driverless Robotaxis in Austin in December and began removing the safety monitor from customer rides in January on a limited basis, which will unlock further expansion of our Robotaxi fleet and coverage area in the Austin-metro. Our Bay Area ride-hailing service began serving the San Jose Airport in October, with plans to expand to other major airports in the Bay Area upon receiving required permitting. FSD (Supervised)1 We launched FSD (Supervised)1 in South Korea, where customers drove over 1 million kilometers using the software in just one month. While we continue to pursue regulatory approval in China and Europe, we began offering ride-along experiences to consumers in Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland. Monthly subscriptions to FSD (Supervised)1 continued to grow sequentially and more than doubled in 2025. Starting this quarter, we are transitioning access to FSD (Supervised)1 to monthly subscriptions only as we begin to sunset the up-front payment option. Automotive Services Services and Other gross profit of approximately $300 million was partly driven by Part Sales and Supercharging. We now offer Tesla Insurance in Florida, as we continue to expand our insurance product to new states. In certain states, customers receive a discount on their insurance premiums when using FSD (Supervised)1. The more you drive with FSD (Supervised)1 enabled, the bigger the discount is on your insurance premium – helping, in certain cases, to completely offset the monthly subscription cost for FSD (Supervised)1. O T H E R U P D A T E S On January 16, 2026, Tesla entered into an agreement to invest approximately $2 billion to acquire shares of Series E Preferred Stock of xAI as part of their recent publicly-disclosed financing round. Tesla’s investment was made on market terms consistent with those previously agreed to by other investors in the financing round. As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok). In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment. Among other things, the framework agreement builds upon the existing relationship between Tesla and xAI by providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies. Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale. This investment is subject to customary regulatory conditions with the expectation to close in Q1'2026. 12 O U T L O O K Volume We are focused on maximum capacity utilization at our factories. Deliveries and deployments will be impacted by aggregate demand for our products, supply chain readiness and allocation decisions between sale to customers or use for our owned and operated fleet. Cash We will manage the businesses such that we ensure a strong balance sheet, maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans – including further vertical integration – and other expenses. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware- related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. Product We continue to evolve and augment our product lineup with a focus on cost, scale and future monetization opportunities via services powered by our AI software. We remain focused on growing our sales volumes through a differentiated and efficiently managed product portfolio, which includes leveraging and optimizing our existing production capacity before building new factories and production lines.

YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items(1): - decrease in vehicle deliveries - lower regulatory credit revenue + growth in Energy Generation and Storage + growth in Services and Other + positive FX impact of $0.3B1 + growth in other automotive ancillary sales, partly driven by an increase in FSD subscriptions + higher vehicle average selling price (ASP) (excl. FX impact1), inclusive of mix impact Profitability Our quarterly operating income decreased 11% YoY to $1.4B, resulting in a 5.7% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items(1): - increase in SBC and Restructuring and Other charges - increase in operating expenses (excl. SBC and Restructuring and Other) driven by AI and other R&D projects and SG&A - higher average cost per vehicle due to lower fixed cost absorption for certain models and an increase in tariffs - decrease in vehicle deliveries - lower regulatory credit revenue + higher vehicle average gross profit due to mix and pricing impacts + growth in Energy Generation and Storage gross profit + growth in Services and Other gross profit + growth in other automotive ancillary sales, partly driven by an increase in FSD subscriptions Cash Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments was $44.1B. The sequential increase of $2.4B was primarily the result of positive free cash flow. 26 (1) Impact is calculated on a constant currency basis. Actuals are compared against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from Q4’24.

A D D I T I O N A L I N F O R M A T I O N WEBCAST INFORMATION Tesla will provide a live webcast of its fourth quarter 2025 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on January 28, 2026 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. “Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, (b) digital assets (gain) loss, net of tax and (c) release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. "Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment, (d) stock-based compensation expense and (e) digital assets loss (gain), net. "Free cash flow" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP automotive gross margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services and supporting infrastructure; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our facilities are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
