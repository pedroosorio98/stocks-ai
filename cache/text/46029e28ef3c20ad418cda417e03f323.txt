Because of this broad growth and the strong underlying performance across each of our businesses, the company delivered record results this quarter. We also want to acknowledge that global competition is getting stronger.” Dimon added: “The healthy U.S. consumer drove double digit growth in client investment assets, card sales and merchant processing volumes. Capital markets were open and active, leading to strong fee and markets revenue performance. In the Corporate & Investment Bank we had record Global IB fees for the first half of the year, maintaining our #1 rank year-to-date. Commercial Banking revenue grew 11%, with particular strength in investment banking and treasury services, as well as solid loan growth. Our Asset & Wealth Management business continued to perform well with positive net long-term and liquidity inflows and continued loan growth.” Dimon concluded: “Our strong, diversified franchise generates significant capital to invest in technology, bankers, products and markets. This quarter alone we announced new card products, the national rollout of our all-mobile bank, Finn, new branches in the Washington D.C. area, and plans for a more significant investment in China. We were also pleased to announce our new capital distribution plan, which includes a meaningful increase in dividends and repurchases. Our highest and best use of capital is to reinvest it in the growth of our clients around the world. We are confident that we will continue to drive long-term value for our clients, communities and shareholders.” FORTRESS PRINCIPLES Book value per share of $68.85, up 4%; tangible book value per share2 of $55.14, up 3% Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital2 of $185 billion and ratio2 of 11.9% Firm SLR2 of 6.5% OPERATING LEVERAGE 2Q18 reported expense of $16.0 billion; reported overhead ratio of 58%; managed overhead ratio2 of 56% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED $6.6 billion4 distributed to shareholders in 2Q18 $4.7 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.56 per share SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $1.4 trillion of credit and capital6 raised YTD $114 billion of credit for consumers $11 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $470 billion of credit for corporations $743 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $26 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 In the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), information is presented on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The discussion below of the Firm’s business segments is also presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, and non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 6. Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the second quarter of 2018 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Net revenue on a reported basis was $27.8 billion, $27.9 billion, and $25.7 billion for the second quarter of 2018, first quarter of 2018, and second quarter of 2017, respectively.

Net revenue was $28.4 billion, up 6%. Net interest income was $13.6 billion, up 9%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Noninterest revenue was $14.7 billion, up 4%, driven by higher Markets revenue, investment banking fees and auto lease income, partially offset by lower Card net interchange income, which includes a rewards liability adjustment of approximately $330 million. The prior year included a benefit related to a legal settlement in Corporate7. Noninterest expense was $16.0 billion, up 8%, driven by higher compensation expense, investments in technology, auto lease depreciation, volume-related transaction costs, and a loss of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity. The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, flat compared with the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 21% compared to approximately 28% in the prior year as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“TCJA”). JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, an increase of 10%. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $6.1 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income as a result of higher deposit margins and growth. Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, down 6%, predominantly driven by production margin compression and lower net servicing revenue. Card, Merchant Services & Auto net revenue was $5.0 billion, up 6%, driven by lower Card acquisition costs, higher Card net interest income on margin expansion and loan growth, and higher auto lease volumes, largely offset by lower Card net interchange income, which includes a rewards liability adjustment of approximately $330 million. Noninterest expense was $6.9 billion, up 6%, predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation and investments in technology. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $286 million, reflecting no reserve actions in the current period, compared with a net reserve build of $250 million in the prior year driven by Card. Net charge-offs were higher in Card, in line with expectations, and this increase was more than offset by a net recovery in Home Lending driven by a loan sale. 4 CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK (CIB) Results for CIB 1Q18 2Q17 ($ millions) 2Q18 1Q18 2Q17 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net revenue $ 9,923 $ 10,483 $ 8,925 $ (560) (5)% $ 998 11% Banking 3,451 3,005 3,159 446 15 292 9 Markets & Investor Services 6,472 7,478 5,766 (1,006) (13) 706 12 Noninterest expense 5,403 5,659 4,877 (256) (5) 526 11 Provision for credit losses 58 (158) (53) 216 NM 111 NM Net income $ 3,198 $ 3,974 $ 2,710 $ (776) (20)% $ 488 18% Discussion of Results: Net income was $3.2 billion, an increase of 18%.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures: Notes on non-GAAP financial measures a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $68.85, $67.59 and $66.05 at June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, and June 30, 2017, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excluded Firmwide legal expense of $0 million, $70 million and $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. Notes on key performance measures d. Estimated as of June 30, 2018. The Basel III regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets and capital ratios, (fully phased-in effective January 1, 2019), and the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”), (fully-phased in effective January 1, 2018), are all considered key regulatory capital measures. The capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) that results, for each quarter, in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”). These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, including the Collins Floor, see Capital Risk Management on pages 82-91 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. e. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 3. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 4. Net of stock issued to employees. 5. Excludes Commercial Card. 6. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and U.S. and non- U.S. government entities, including U.S. states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents credit provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. 7. The prior-year legal benefit relates to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts, which was recognized in noninterest revenue in Corporate. 8. Reflects a reduction of approximately $160 million in FTE adjustments compared with the prior year quarter, resulting from the enactment of the TCJA. 9. Energy includes Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals & Mining. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
