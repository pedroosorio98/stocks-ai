Listed Company &nbsp; Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, May 2, 2022 &ndash; With the objective of correcting and clarifying inaccurate and out of context information regarding the compensation of our Executive Officers remuneration released in the news and social media in the last few days, Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo; Nu &rdquo; or the &ldquo; Company &rdquo;) clarifies to its shareholders and the market the following: &nbsp; 1 The 2022 Reference Form (&quot; Formul&aacute;rio de Refer&ecirc;ncia &quot;) of the Company discloses an estimated compensation for its Executive Officers of R$ 804.4 million during the 2022 calendar year (Chart 13.2). However, from this amount (i) R$ 678.9 million, or 84%, refers to the annual accounting recognition of the Contingent Share Award (&ldquo;CSA&rdquo;), and (ii) R$ 125.5 million, or 16%, refers to the remaining compensation of the Executive Officers in 2022. 2 The CSA is a stock compensation program granted to our founder and CEO, David V&eacute;lez, conditioned to the achievement of ambitious targets, which will represent almost 100% of the total compensation of Mr. V&eacute;lez throughout the next 5 years, this is the minimum period that Mr. V&eacute;lez must remain in the Company to be entitled to the benefits of the CSA. 3 The CSA was approved by the Company Board of Directors in October 2021 and ratified by our shareholders, as set forth in our articles. It determines that Company stock will be issued to Mr. V&eacute;lez as a long-term incentive award, subject to specific performance of Nu Holdings stock, as disclosed in our Final Prospectus of December 8, 2021 (&quot; Prospectus &quot;) and the 2022 Reference Form: (i) &#9;Mr. V&eacute;lez will be compensated with Class A common shares equivalent to 1% of the social capital of the Company, if our stock price reaches the threshold of US$18.69, around 3 times our last stock closing price; and (ii) &#9;Mr. V&eacute;lez will be compensated with Class A common shares equivalent to 1% of the social capital of the Company, if our stock price reaches the threshold of US$35.30, around 6 times our last stock closing price . 4 If the market prices of our stock do not reach these thresholds, the variable compensation of Mr. V&eacute;lez will be zero during this period of 5 years, thus, Mr. V&eacute;lez will not be entitled to any form of variable compensation, be it of long or short term, in cash, stock, or pegged to stock. &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 The CSA sets forth ambitious targets that reflect levels of market capitalization attractive to our shareholders. Therefore, the CSA creates a long-term interest alignment, strong and transparent, between Mr. V&eacute;lez and our shareholders. This plan was approved by our Board of Directors and prepared with the support of an internationally renowed consulting firm, which analyzed the best global practices. 6 Mr. V&eacute;lez adhered to the Giving Pledge initiative and committed to donate all the stock resulting from the CSA to the philanthropic platform that his family has established to help foster opportunities for vulnerable and underprivileged children and young adults from Latin America, as previously mentioned in the Prospectus. &nbsp; &nbsp; Contacts: Investor Contact: Guilherme Lago investors@nubank.com.br &nbsp; Media Contact: Leila Suwwan press@nubank.com.br &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings Ltd. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By:&nbsp; /s/ Guilherme Lago &nbsp; &nbsp; Guilherme Lago Chief Financial Officer &nbsp; Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;May 2, 2022 &nbsp;
