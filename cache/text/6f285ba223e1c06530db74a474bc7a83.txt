Historically, our delivery volumes have skewed towards the end of each quarter due to regional batch building of cars. &nbsp;As our production volumes continue to grow, it is becoming increasingly challenging to secure vehicle transportation capacity and at a reasonable cost during these peak logistics weeks. &nbsp;In Q3, we began transitioning to a more even regional mix of vehicle builds each week, which led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter. &nbsp;These cars have been ordered and will be delivered to customers upon arrival at their destination. &nbsp; &nbsp; Production Deliveries Subject to operating lease accounting Model S/X 19,935 18,672 10% Model 3/Y 345,988 325,158 3% Total 365,923 343,830 3% &nbsp; *** Tesla will post its financial results for the third quarter of 2022 after market close on Wednesday, October 19, 2022.
