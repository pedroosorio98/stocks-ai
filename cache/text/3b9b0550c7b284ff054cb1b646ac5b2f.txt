In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis for the full years 2022, 2023 and 2024, refer to page 67 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (“JPMorganChase’s”) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (“2024 Form 10- K”). For all other periods presented, refer to the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures disclosure in JPMorganChase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for each respective year or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for respective quarters 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, without the volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes that disclosure of these measures provides investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets for the full year 2024, refer to page 68 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10- K. For all other periods presented, refer to the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures disclosure in JPMorganChase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for each respective year or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for respective quarters 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets(other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE atperiod-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE for the full years 2023 and 2024, refer to page 69 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. For all other periods presented, refer to the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures disclosure in JPMorganChase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for each respective year 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense of $740mm for the full year ended December 31, 2024. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of certain items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 5. Full-year 2024 results included a $7.9B net gain related to Visa shares and a $1.0B donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation, which were previously disclosed in the second quarter of 2024. Full-year 2024 revenue, adjusted overhead ratio, net income and ROTCE excluding these significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $7.9B to reported revenue from $180.6B to $172.7B, an increase of 2ppts to the adjusted OH ratio from 50% to 52%, a decrease of $5.4B to reported net income from $58.5B to $53.0B and a decrease of 2ppts to reported ROTCE from 22% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts inassessing the Firm’s results 18 Notes on slide 2 Slide 2 – Being complete, global, diversified and at scale enables us to meet clients’ and customers’ needs across the spectrum and through cycles 1.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active exchange-traded funds (ETF) assets under management (AUM) in funds ranked in the 1stor 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peerrankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds, and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and ACC share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class. Due to a methodology change effective September 30, 2023, prior results include all long-term mutual fund assets and exclude active ETF assets. 10.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active exchange-traded funds (ETF) assets under management (AUM) in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile: All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds, and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and ACC share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class. Due to a methodology change effective September 30, 2023, prior results include all long-term mutual fund assets and exclude active ETF assets.
