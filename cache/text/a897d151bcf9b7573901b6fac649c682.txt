While we face a continued high level of complex geopolitical issues, global growth stabilized, albeit at a lower level, and resolution of some trade issues helped support client and market activity towards the end of the year. The U.S. consumer continues to be in a strong position and we see the benefits of this across our consumer businesses. In Consumer & Community Banking, average deposits grew at 5%, somewhat aided by lower short-term rates, and we continued to add customers in new and existing markets, and deepen our customer relationships by offering great deposit, investment and lending products. The robust holiday season was reflected in our card sales volumes and loan balances, up 10% and 8%, respectively.” Dimon added: “The Corporate & Investment Bank generated record fourth quarter revenue - including for the Markets business, which rebounded from a challenging prior year. For the quarter, Global Investment Banking fees were up slightly from a strong performance last year, and for the full year we grew our IB fee wallet share to its highest level in a decade, maintaining our #1 rank for the 11th consecutive year. Commercial Banking earned a record $2.7 billion of IB revenue in 2019 and continued to add new client relationships on the back of our investments in bankers and technology in the U.S. and abroad. In Asset & Wealth Management, we grew loans and deposits at a healthy pace, and for the full-year, we brought in record long-term net flows of $100 billion.” Dimon concluded: “We continue to invest in and grow our businesses. For example, in 2019, we added over 70 new branches in 16 new markets, continued our Commercial Banking international expansion, and became the first U.S. bank to be approved for a majority-owned securities business in China. We continue to make large investments in technology, including AI, cloud, digital and payments, as well as other investments in innovation, talent, security and risk controls. These actions will help us continue to grow and serve our clients going forward. I am extremely proud of how we serve our customers, clients and communities globally - we stand by them in good times and in tough times, and work to earn their trust every single day.” FORTRESS PRINCIPLES Book value per share of $75.98, up 8%; tangible book value per share1 of $60.98, up 8% Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital2 of $188 billion and ratio2 of 12.4% Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.3% OPERATING LEVERAGE 4Q19 reported expense of $16.3 billion; reported overhead ratio of 58%; managed overhead ratio1 of 56% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED $9.5 billion4 distributed to shareholders in 4Q19 $6.7 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.90 per share SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $2.3 trillion of credit and capital7 raised in 2019 $262 billion of credit for consumers $33 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $863 billion of credit for corporations $1.0 trillion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $79 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Net revenue was a loss of $228 million, reflecting approximately $190 million of net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments in the quarter. Compared to the prior year, net revenue decreased $355 million, predominantly driven by lower net interest income on lower rates. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, net revenue decreased $920 million largely driven by lower net interest income on lower rates, as well as the private equity markdowns in the current quarter. The prior quarter also included a benefit from income related to loan sales in Home Lending. Noninterest expense of $343 million was lower by $165 million driven by the timing of contributions to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $75.98, $75.24 and $70.35 at December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 2. Estimated.
