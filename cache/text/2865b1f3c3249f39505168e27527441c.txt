(NYSE: JPM) today reported third– quarter 2008 net income of $527 million, compared with net income of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Earnings per share were $0.11, comp ared with $0.97 in the third quarter of 2007. Current-quarter results include a charge of $1.2 billion (after-tax) to conform loan loss reserves and an extraordinary gain of $581 million (after-t ax), related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations, which closed on September 25, 2008. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter: “Our third quarter financial results declined sharply, driv en by markdowns on mortgage trading positions and leveraged loans, and higher credit costs due to continued deterioration in our home-lending 1 Washington Mutual merger-related results subject to future refinements 2 Source: Dealogic for fees and Thomson Reuters for volumes J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release portfolio. In this environment, we have kept our focus on meeting our clients’ needs and deploying capital wisely. We continue to see numerous exam ples of organic growth, including in Investment Banking market share, new checking accounts, net fl ows in Asset Management and increased loan and liability balances in Commercial Banking and Treasury & Securities Services.” Mr. Dimon further remarked: “I am pleased that we were in a position during the quarter to purchase Washington Mutual’s banking operat ions, becoming the largest U.S. depository institution, with more than $900 billion in depo sits. We welcome Washington Mutual employees to JPMorgan Chase and look forward to bringing together the best of both firms. This acquisition adds more than 2,200 branches, allowing us to e xpand nationwide – both in our existing markets and into attractive new ones, in states like Calif ornia, Florida and Washington – and to further grow our other business lines through our enhanced branch network.” “We expect the Washington Mutual transaction to create long-term value for shareholders while also being immediately accretive, adding 50 cents per share to earni ngs in 2009. In light of the unprecedented challenges and risks facing the housi ng market, we have incorporated expectations of significant credit losses from Washington Mutual’s home-lending portfolio into the structure of the transaction. We also raised $11.5 billion of common equity to support the transaction and add to our already substantial capital base.” Dimon added: “Given the uncertainty in the capi tal markets, housing sector and economy overall, it is reasonable to expect reduced earnings for our firm over the next few quarters. However, with a total loan loss allowance of $19 billion (including Washingt on Mutual) and an 8.9% Tier 1 capital ratio, we feel well-positioned to handle the turbulent environment and, most importantly, to continue to invest in our businesses and serve our clients well.” “Finally, I want to express how proud I am of our employees – their outstanding efforts and commitment to building a great company under extremely stressful circumstances has made a tremendous difference in our ability to manage ri sk and execute complex transactions. Together, we will continue to focus on creating a stronger and more profitable franchise in the years to come.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Advisory fees were $576 million, down 3% from the prior year, refl ecting decreased levels of activ ity. Debt underwriting fees were $499 million, up 7%. Equity underwriting fees were $518 million, up 94% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $815 million, up 19% from the prior year. The increase was driven by record results in rates and currencies, and strong performance in credit trading, emerging markets, and commodities, as well as gains of $343 million from the widening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Largely offsetting these re sults were mortgage-related net markdowns of $2.6 billion, as well as $1.0 billion of net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments. Equity Markets revenue was a record $1.7 bill ion, up by $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven by strong trading resu lts and client revenue, as well as a gain of $429 million from the widening of the firm’s credit sp read on certain structured liabilities. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $23 million, down $415 million from the prior year, reflecting net markdowns due to wider counterpa rty credit spreads and fewer gain s from loan workouts, largely offset by higher net interest income and increased revenue from risk management activities. The provision for credit losses was $234 million, co mpared with $227 million in the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $13 mill ion, compared with $67 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to total loans retained was 3.85% for the current quarter, an increase from 1.80% in the prior year. Average loans retained were $69.0 billion, an incr ease of $7.1 billion, or 11%, from the prior year, largely driven by growth in acquisition finance activity, including leveraged lending. Average fair value and held-for-sale loans were $17.6 billion, up $297 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 60%, from the prior year, largely driven by higher compensation expense and additional operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger.

These factors were offset partially by revenue growth in all businesses. Net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $674 million, or 16%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.1 billion, up $463 million, or 17%, due to higher loan and deposit balances and wider deposit spreads. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, up $211 million, or 14%, as higher net mortgage servicing revenue and increased deposit-related fees were offset partially by declines in education loan sales. The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, as housing price decl ines have continued to result in significant increases in estimated losses, pa rticularly for high loan-to-value home equity and mortgage loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $663 million (2.78% net charge-off rate), compared with $150 million (0.65% net charge-off ra te) in the prior year.

The current-quarter provision includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $450 m illion due to increases in estimated losses in the subprime and home equity mortgage portfolios. An additional $250 million increase in the allowance for loan losses for prime mortgage loans has been reflected in the Corporate segment. Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, an increas e of $303 million, or 12%, from the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage reinsurance losses and increased servicing expense. Regional Banking net income was $218 million, down $393 m illion, or 64%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $3.7 billion, up $363 million, or 11%, as the benefits of higher loan and deposit balances, wider deposit spreads and higher deposit-re lated fees were offset partially by declines in education loan sales. The provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion, compared with $574 million in the prior year. The provision reflected weakne ss in the home equity and mortgage portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provi sion for credit losses for further detail).

Discussion of Results: Net income was $292 million, a decline of $494 million, or 63%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.

Average managed loans were $157.6 billion, an increase of $8.9 billion, or 6%, from th e prior year and $4.7 b illion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year in both end-of-p eriod and average managed loans reflects organic portfolio growth. Managed net revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of $20 million, or 1%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, up $133 million, or 4%, from the prior year, driven by higher average managed loan balances and wider loan spr eads. These benefits were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with higher char ge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $646 million, a decrease of $113 million, or 15%, fr om the prior year. Interchange income increased, benefiting from a 5% increase in charge volume, but was more th an offset by increased rewards expense and higher volume-driven payments to partners (both of which are netted against interchange income), as well as a decrease in securitization income. The managed provision for credit losses was $2 .2 billion, an increase of $866 million, or 64%, from the prior year, due to a hi gher level of charge-offs and an increase of $250 million in the allowance for loan losses.

These benefits were offset partially by market depreciation. Treasury Services net revenue was a record $897 million, an increase of $117 million, or 15%, reflecting higher liability balances as well as volume growth in electronic funds transfer products and trade loans.

Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $244 milli on, or 11%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a decline of $331 million, or 17%, due to lower performance fees and the effect of lower markets, including the impact of lower market valuat ions of seed capital investments; these effects were offset partially by the benefit of the B ear Stearns merger and increased revenue from net asset inflows. Net interest income was $380 million, up $87 million, or 30%, from the prior year, predominantly due to higher loan and deposit balances and wider deposit spreads. Private Bank revenue was $631 million, relatively flat compared with the prior year, as increased loan and deposit balances and higher assets under management largely offset the effect of lower markets and lower performance fees.

Assets under supervision were $1.6 trillion, an incr ease of $23 billion, or 1%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, down $10 billion, or 1%, from the prior year.

Net loss included a charge of $1.2 billion (after tax) to conform loan loss reserves and an extraordinary gain of $581 million (after-tax) re lated to the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations, which closed on September 25, 2008. Net loss also included $95 million (after tax) of continuing Bear Stearns merger-related items. Net loss for Private Equity was $164 million, compared with net income of $409 million in the prior year. Net revenue was negative $216 milli on, a decrease of $949 million, reflecting Private Equity losses of $206 million, comp ared with gains of $766 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $41 million, a decline of $54 milli on from the prior year, reflecting lower compensation expense. Excluding the above merger-related items, the ne t loss for Corporate was $1.1 billion, compared with net income of $142 million in the prior year. Net revenue was negative $1.5 billion, compared with revenue of $268 million in the prior year. This decrease reflects a hi gher level of trading losses, including losses of $1.0 billion on preferred securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a $375 million charge related to the offer to repurchas e auction-rate securities, and the absence of a $115 million gain from the sale of MasterCard shares in the prior year. These losses were offset partially by securities gains of $440 million. Excluding the provision related to Washington Mutual, the current-quarter provision for credit losses of $378 million includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $250 million for prime mortgage (see Retail Financial Services’ discussion of the provision for loan losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $127 million, a decrease of $23 million from the prior year, driven by lower litigation expense. 10 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Private Equity portfolio totaled $7.5 b illion, up from $6.6 billion in the prior year and down from $7.7 billion in the prior quarter. The portfolio represented 7.5% of total stockholders’ equity le ss goodwill, down from 8.8% in the prior year and 8.9% in the prior quarter.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP bas is was $14,737 million, $18,399 million and $16,112 million for the third quarter of 2008, second quarter of 2008 and third quarter of 2007, respectively. (b) Provision for the third quarter of 2008 included a $1,976 million charge to conform Washington Mutual’s allowance for loan losses with JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policy.. Discussion of Results: Net income was $527 million, a d ecrease of $2.8 billion, or 84%, from the prior year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $16.1 billion, a decrease of $889 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $5.2 billion, down $3.3 billion, or 39%, due to lower principal transactions revenue, which reflected mortga ge-related net markdowns and net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitment s. Net interest income was $10.9 billion, up $2.4 billion, or 29%, due to higher trading-related net interest income and higher loan and deposit balances. The managed provision for credit losses was $6.7 billion, including the $2.0 billion charge to conform Washington Mutual’s loan loss allowance; however, this charge is excluded from the following analyses. The managed provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion, up $2.3 billion, or 98%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $4.3 billion, compared with $2.0 billion in the prior year, reflec ting increases in the allowance for credit losses related to home equity, subprime and prime mortga ge and credit card loans, as well as higher net charge-offs. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $3.3 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net char ge-off rates of 3.40% a nd 1.96%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $398 million, compared with $351 million in the prior year, due to an increase in the allowance for cr edit losses reflecting the effect of a weakening credit environment and loan growth. Wholesale net charge-offs were $52 million, compared with net charge-offs of $82 million, resu lting in net charge-off rates of 0.10% and 0.19%, respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $15.9 billion at September 30, 2008, up from the prior- year level of $3.0 billion. The amount at September 30, 2008 included $8.1 billion of nonperforming assets from the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations. Noninterest expense was $11.1 billio n, up $1.8 billion, or 19%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher compensation expense and additional operati ng costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger. 11 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.9% at September 30, 2008 (es timated), 9.2% at June 30, 2008, and 8.4% at September 30, 2007.  Headcount was 228,452, which includes 41,785 from the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations. The remaining 186,667, which includes the effect of the Bear Stearn s merger, reflects an increase of 6,820 from September 30, 2007. 12 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, wh ich is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have be en securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same unde rwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the cr edit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second , managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presente d on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See pa ge 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (third quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. 13 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(f) The third quarter of 2008 included an accounting conformity loan loss reserve provision and an extraordinary gain related to the Washington Mutual transaction, as well as losses on preferred equity interests in Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"). Prior periods included the after-tax impact of material litigation actions, tax audit benefits, equity earnings related to Bear Stearns and merger costs. (g) Common equivalent shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008, as the effect would be antidilutive. (h) Estimated.
