Ours is an exceptional company with an extraordinary heritage and a promising future. Throughout a period of profound political and economic change around the world, our company has been steadfast in our dedication to the clients, communities and countries we serve while earning a fair return for our shareholders. 2016 was another breakthrough year for our company. We earned a record $24.7 billion in net income on revenue 1 of $99.1 billion, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We have delivered record results in six out of the last seven years, and we hope to continue to deliver in the future. Our stock price is a measure of the progress we have made over the years. This progress is a function of continually making important investments, in good times and not so good times, to build our capabilities — people, systems and products. These Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 1 Represents managed revenue 33 investments drive the future prospects of our company and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Whether looking back over five years, 10 years or since the Bank One/JPMorgan Chase merger (approximately 12 years ago), our stock has significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 and the S&P Financials Index. And this is during a time of unprecedented challenges for banks — both the Great Recession and Stock total return analysis Bank One S&P 500 S&P Financials Index Performance since becoming CEO of Bank One (3/27/2000—12/31/2016) 1 Compounded annual gain 11.5% 4.3% 3.1% Overall gain 524.6% 103.0% 65.9% JPMorgan Chase & Co.

We have long contended that these factors explained why bank stock price/earnings ratios were appropriately depressed. And we believe the anticipated reversal of many negatives and the expectation of a more business-friendly environment, coupled with our sustained, strong business results, are among the reasons our stock price has done so well this past year. As you know, we believe tangible book value per share is a good measure of the value we have created for our shareholders. If we believe our asset and liability values are appropriate — and we do — and if we believe we can continue to deploy this capital at an approximate 15% return on tangible equity, which we do, then our company should ultimately be worth considerably more than tangible book value. If you look at the chart below, you’ll see that tangible book value “anchors” the stock price. In the last five years, we have bought back $25.7 billion in stock. In prior years, I have explained why buying back our stock at tangible book value per share was a no- brainer. While the first and most important use of capital is to invest in growth, buying back stock should also be considered when you are generating excess capital.

In this chart, we are looking at heritage Bank One shareholders and JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders. The chart shows the increase in tangible book value per share; it is an after-tax number assuming all dividends were retained vs. the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a pre-tax number with dividends reinvested. 1 On March 27, 2000, Jamie Dimon was hired as CEO of Bank One. currently have excess capital. Five years ago, we offered the example of our buying back stock at tangible book value and having earnings per share and tangible book value per share substantially higher than they otherwise would have been just four years later. While we prefer buying our stock at tangible book value, we think it makes sense to do so at or around two times tangible book value for reasons similar to those we’ve expressed in the past. If we buy back a big block of stock this year (using analyst earnings estimates for the next five years), we would expect earnings per share in five years to be 3%—4% higher, and tangible book value would be virtually unchanged. In this letter, I discuss the issues highlighted on the next page — which describe many of our successes and opportunities, as well as our challenges and responses. Like last year’s letter, we have organized much of the content around some of the key questions we have received from shareholders and other interested parties. 66 I. The JPMorgan Chase franchise 1. Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? 2. Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities? 3. What are some technology and fintech initiatives that you’re most excited about? 4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data? 5. What are your biggest geopolitical risks? 6. Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why? II. Regulatory reform 1. Talk about the strength and safety of the financial system and whether Too Big to Fail has been solved. 2. How and why should capital rules be changed? 3. How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets? 4. How has regulation affected monetary policy, the flow of bank credit and the growth of the economy? 5. How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualified borrowers access to the credit they need? 6. How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system? 7. How can we harmonize regulations across the globe? III. Public policy 1. The United States of America is truly an exceptional country. 2. But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back. 3. How can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy? 4. What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack of a plan and investment hurt our economy? 5. How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize investment and job creation? 6. What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and free enterprise? 7. Strong collaboration is needed between business and government.

Why do we consider our four major business franchises strong and market leading? The chart below and those on page 8 speak for themselves. Looking closely at the actual numbers, it’s clear that every business is among the top performers financially – whether you look at efficiency (overhead ratios) or return on equity (ROE) vs. the best in that business. More important, customer satisfaction is at the center of everything we do. Each business has gained market share – which is possible only when you are improving customer satisfaction and your I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE products and services relative to the competi- tion. And each business continues to inno- vate, from customer-facing apps, to straight- through processing, to digitized trading services or payment systems. Our business leaders do a great job describing their busi- nesses, and I strongly encourage you to read their letters following this year’s Letter to Shareholders. Each will give you a feel for why we are optimistic about our future.

THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 2. Why are we optimistic about our future growth opportunities? We believe we have substantial opportuni- ties in the decades ahead to drive organic growth in our company. We have confidence in the underlying growth in the U.S. and global economies, which will fuel the growth in our customer base – consumer deposits, assets under management and small to large clients globally. This growth will obviously be faster in emerging markets than in devel- oped markets – and we are well-positioned to serve both. In addition, we believe we can continue to gain share in many markets and, over time, add new, relevant products. This can drive organic growth for years. Capturing this growth is very basic: • Selectively adding investment bankers and private bankers around the world • Bringing consumer and commercial banking branches and capabilities to more places in the United States • Adding wholesale branches overseas and carefully expanding into new countries • Adding wholesale and Private Bank clients as they grow into our target space Equally important is using technology and fintech to do a better job serving clients and to grow our businesses – with better products and services. You can read more about our big data, machine learning, payment systems, cybersecurity and electronic trading on pages 47–68 described by our senior executives. But I do want to highlight a few items in the next question that pertain to these topics. 3. What are some technology and fintech initiatives that you’re most excited about? One of the reasons we’re performing well as a company is we never stopped investing in technology – this should never change. In 2016, we spent more than $9.5 billion in technology firmwide, of which approxi- mately $3 billion is dedicated toward new initiatives. Of that amount, approximately $600 million is spent on emerging fintech solutions – which include building and improving digital and mobile services and partnering with fintech companies. The reasons we invest so much in technology (whether it’s digital, big data or machine learning) are simple: to benefit customers with better, faster and often cheaper prod- ucts and services, to reduce errors and to make the firm more efficient. We are developing great new products. We are currently developing some exciting new products and services, which we will be adding to our suite and rolling out later this year, including: • End-to-end digital banking – The ability to open an account and complete the majority of transactions on a mobile phone. • Investment advice and self-directed investing – Online vehicles for both indi- vidual retirement and non-retirement accounts, providing easy-to-use (and inexpensive) automated advice, as well as enabling our customers to buy and sell stocks and bonds, etc. (again inexpensively). • Electronic trading and other online services (e.g., cash management) in our Corporate & Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth Management businesses – Offering our clients a more robust digital platform. 1010 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE We are investing in data and technology to improve the financial health of low-income households. Over the last two years, the JPMorgan Chase Institute has helped identify some of the most pressing financial challenges facing American households, such as their difficulty managing income and expense volatility. We are using that data to select and support innovative fintech companies and nonprofits that are designing solutions to address these challenges. One example of these efforts is JPMorgan Chase’s Financial Solutions Lab, which, in partnership with the Center for Financial Services Innovation, seeks to facilitate the next generation of fintech prod- ucts to help consumers manage their daily finances and meet their long-term goals. Highlights of the initiative include: • To date, the Lab has helped support more than 18 fintech companies working to improve the financial health of more than 1 million Americans. One example is Digit, an automated savings tool that identi- fies small amounts of money that can be moved into savings based on spending and income. To date, it has helped Ameri- cans save more than $350 million. • Lab winners have raised more than $100 million in follow-on capital. • In 2017, we launched a new competition seeking innovative fintech solutions to promote the financial health of popula- tions often overlooked, such as people of color, individuals with disabilities and low- income women. We are successfully collaborating with other companies to deliver fintech solutions. Whether it is consumer payment systems (Zelle), mortgages (Roostify), auto finance (TrueCar), small business lending (OnDeck Capital) or communications systems (Symphony), we are successfully collabo- rating with some excellent fintech companies to dramatically improve our digital and other customer offerings. I’d like to highlight just two new exciting areas: • Developer Services API store – By providing direct interfaces with our appli- cations (fully controlled, of course), we are enabling entrepreneurs, partners, fintech companies and clients to build new prod- ucts or services dedicated to specific needs. • Bill payment and business services – While I can’t reveal much at the moment, suffice it to say there are some interesting developments coming as we integrate our capabilities with those of other companies. 4. How do we protect customers and their sensitive information while enabling them to share data? For years, we have been describing the risks – to banks and customers – that arise when customers freely give away their bank pass- codes to third-party services, allowing virtu- ally unlimited access to their data. Customers often do not know the liability this may create for them, if their passcode is misused, and, in many cases, they do not realize how their data are being used. For example, access to the data may continue for years after customers have stopped using the third-party services. We recently completed a new arrangement with Intuit, which we think represents an important step forward. In addition to protecting the bank, the customers and even the third party (in this case, Intuit), it allows customers to share data – how and when they want. Under this arrangement, customers can choose whatever they would like to share and opting to turn these selec- tions on or off as they see fit. The data will be “pushed” to Intuit, eliminating the need for sharing bank passcodes, which protects the bank and our customers and reduces potential liabilities on Intuit’s part as well. We are hoping this sets a new standard for data-sharing relationships. 1111 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE 5. What are your biggest geopolitical risks? Banks have to manage a lot of risks – from credit and trading risks to technological, operational, conduct and cybersecurity risks. But in addition to those, we have exposures around the world, which are subject to normal cyclical and recession risks, as well as to complex geopolitical risks. There are always geopolitical risks, and you can rest assured we are continuously reviewing, analyzing and stress testing them to ensure that our company can endure them. We always try to make certain that we can handle the worst of all cases – importantly, without disrupting the effective operation of the company and its service to our clients. We think these geopolitical risks currently are in a heightened state – that is, beyond what we might consider normal. There are two specific risks I want to point out: Brexit and the increasing risk to the European Union (EU). Regarding Brexit, a key concern is to make sure our company is prepared to support our clients on day one – the first day after the actual Brexit occurs, approximately two years from now. We are confident we will be able to develop and expand the capabilities that our EU subsidiaries and branches will need to serve our clients properly in Europe under EU law. This will require acquiring regulatory approvals, transferring certain technologies and moving some people. On day one, we need to perform all of our critical functions at our standards. For example, underwriting debt and equity, moving money and accepting deposits, and safeguarding the custody assets for all of our European clients, including many sovereigns themselves. We must be prepared to do this assuming a hard exit by the United Kingdom – it would be irrespon- sible to presume otherwise. While this does not entail moving many people in the next two years, we do suspect that following Brexit, there will be constant pressure by the EU not to “outsource” services to the United Kingdom but to continue to move people and capabili- ties into EU subsidiaries. We hope that the advent of Brexit would lead the EU to focus on fixing its issues – immi- gration, bureaucracy, the ongoing loss of sovereign rights and labor inflexibility – and thereby pulling the EU and the monetary union closer together. Our fear, however, is that it could instead result in political unrest that would force the EU to split apart. The unraveling of the EU and the monetary union could have devastating economic and political effects. While we are not predicting this will happen, the probabilities have certainly gone up – and we will keep a close eye on the situa- tion in Europe over the next several years. De-globalization, Mexico and China. Anti-globalization sentiment is growing in parts of the world today, usually expressing itself in anti-trade and anti-immigration posi- tions. (I’m not going to write about immigra- tion in this letter – we have always supported proper immigration – it is a vital part of the strength of America, and, properly done, it enhances the economy and the vitality of the country.) We do not believe globalization will reverse course – we believe trade has been absolutely critical for growth around the world and has benefited billions of people. While there are some issues with our trade policies that need to be fixed, poorly conceived anti-trade policies could be quite disruptive, particularly with two of our key trading partners: Mexico and China. The trade deal with Mexico through NAFTA is simpler than the one with China. (In full disclosure, JPMorgan Chase is a major inter- national bank in Mexico, with revenue of more than $400 million, serving Mexican, American and international clients who do business there.) Mexico is a long-standing peaceful neighbor, and it is wholly in our country’s interest that Mexico be a pros- perous nation. This actually reduces immi- gration issues (there are now more Mexicans 1212 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE going back to Mexico than coming into the United States). Our trade agreement with Mexico helps ensure that the young democ- racy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders (like Chavez did in Venezuela). While there are some clear, identifiable problems with NAFTA, I believe they will be worked out in a way that is fair and beneficial for both sides. The logic to do so is completely compelling. China is far more complex. (Again, in full disclosure, we have a major international presence in China, with revenue of approxi- mately $700 million, serving Chinese, American and international clients who do business in that country.) The United States has some serious trade issues with China, which have grown over the years – from cybersecurity and the protection of intel- lectual property to tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and non-fulfillment of World Trade Organization obligations. However, there is no inevitable or compelling reason that China and America have to clash – in fact, improving political and economic relation- ships can be good for both parties. So while the issues here are not easy, I am hopeful they can be resolved in a way that is fair and constructive for the two countries. 6. Although banks and other large companies remain unpopular with some people, you often say how proud you are of JPMorgan Chase. Why? I firmly believe the qualities embedded in JPMorgan Chase today – the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our deep client relationships, our technology, our strategic thinking and our global presence – cannot be replicated. While we take nothing for granted, as long as we continue to do our jobs well and continue to drive our company forward, we think we can be a leader for our industry and the communities we serve for decades to come. There are times when I am bursting with pride with what we have accomplished for our clients, communities and countries around the world – let me count (some of) the ways: We are strong and steadfast and are there for our clients in good times and bad. In the toughest of times, we maintained a healthy and vibrant company that was able to do its job – we did not need govern- ment support and, in fact, we consistently provided credit and capital to our clients and assistance to our government throughout the crisis. I want to remind our shareholders that we continued to lend not at the much higher prevailing market rates at that time but at existing bank rates. These were far below market rates because our clients relied on us – we were their lender of last resort. JPMorgan Chase was and will be a Rock of Gibraltar in the best and worst of times for our clients around the world. 1313 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE We have extraordinary capabilities — both our people and our technology. Ultimately, our people are our most impor- tant assets – and they are exceptional. Their knowledge, their capabilities and their relationships are what drive everything else, including our technology and our innovation. They partner well with each other around the world, and they are deeply trusted by our clients and within our communities. We all owe them an enormous debt. They are the ones accomplishing all the things you are reading about in this Annual Report. Our fortress balance sheet and the strength of our people were never more vividly evident than during the darkest hours of the financial crisis.

THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE to acquire and assimilate Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual – thereby saving 30,000 jobs and avoiding the devastation of commu- nities that would have happened if those companies had been allowed to fail. Our company went above and beyond the call of duty during the height of the crisis, including lending $87 billion to a bankrupt Lehman to facilitate, as much as possible, an orderly unwind of its assets. In those dark days, we were the only bank willing to commit to lending $4 billion to the state of California, $2 billion to the state of New Jersey and $1 billion to the state of Illinois to keep those states strong. None of these actions had to be taken, and they were made at some risk to JPMorgan Chase. We simply were acting to do our part to try to stop the crisis from getting worse. We try to be outstanding corporate citizens. We believe in being great corporate citizens – in how we treat our employees and care for our clients and communities. Let me give some examples to illustrate this point: • We compensate our employees fairly and provide extraordinary benefits and training. We value our employees at JPMorgan Chase, and we are committed to helping them succeed. This past year, we announced that we will increase our minimum wages – mostly for entry-level bank tellers and customer service repre- sentatives – to between $12.00 and $16.50 an hour (depending on where these employees live). This will increase wages for approximately 18,000 employees. We believe this pay increase is the right thing to do, and, above all, it enables more people to begin to share in the rewards Assets Entrusted to Us by Our Clients at December 31, ($ in billions) 1 Represents assets under management, as well as custody, brokerage, administration and deposit accounts. 2 Represents activities associated with the safekeeping and servicing of assets. /UIstopClient assets /UIstopWholesale deposits /UIstopConsumer deposits Deposits and client assets1 201620152014201320122011 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 $1,883 $730 $398 $2,061 $755 $439 $2,329 $824 $464 $2,376 $861 $503$3,255 $3,617 $3,740 $2,353 $2,427 $722 $757 $558 $618 $3,633 $3,802 $16 ,870 $18,835 $20,485 $20,549 $19,943 $20,520 $3,011 Assets under custody2 1515 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE of our success. Remember, many of these employees soon move on to even higher paying jobs. We will also continue to invest in employee benefits and training opportu- nities so that our workers can continue to increase their skills and advance their careers. Our comprehensive benefits package, including healthcare and retire- ment savings, on average, is valued at $11,000 per year. Our total investment in training and development is approximately $325 million a year. Together, these efforts help our employees support their fami- lies, advance their careers and promote economic growth in our communities. • We have a diverse workforce. We have more than 243,000 employees globally with over 167,000 in the United States. Women represent 50% of our employees. Recently, Oliver Wyman, a leading global manage- ment consulting firm, issued a report stating that it would be 30 years before women reach 30% Executive Committee representation within global financial services. So you might be surprised to find out that women already represent 30% of my direct reports and approximately 30% of our company’s senior leadership globally. They run major businesses – several units on their own would be among Fortune 1000 companies. In addition to having three women on our Operating Committee – who run Asset & Wealth Management, Finance and Legal – some of our other busi- nesses and functions headed by women include Consumer Banking, Credit Card, U.S. Private Bank, U.S. Mergers & Acquisi- tions, Global Equity Capital Markets, Global Research, Regulatory Affairs, Global Philanthropy, our U.S. branch network, our Controller and firmwide Marketing. I believe we have some of the best women leaders in the corporate world globally. In addition to gender diversity, 48% of our firm’s population is ethnically diverse in the United States, and we are in more than 60 countries around the world. Diversity means running a company where people are respected, trusted and given equal opportunity to contribute and raise their ideas and voices. But there is one area in particular where we simply have not met the standards JPMorgan Chase has set for itself – and that is in increasing African-American talent at the firm. While we think our effort to attract and retain black talent is as good as at most other companies, it simply is not good enough. Therefore, in 2016, we introduced a new firmwide initiative called Advancing Black Leaders. This initiative is dedicated to helping us better attract and recruit external black talent while retaining and developing the talent within the company. And we are proud of our efforts this past year – we increased the number of black employees at the officer level (through both internal promotions and external new hires), we focused on the pipeline of junior talent, and we increased the number at the senior officer and vice president level. We plan to continue to make progress on this front in the years to come. • We are proud of how we are helping veterans. We want to continue to update you on how JPMorgan Chase has helped position military members, veterans and their families. Our program is centered on facilitating success in their post-service lives primarily through employment and retention. In 2011, JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies launched the 100,000 Jobs Mission, setting a goal of collectively hiring 100,000 veterans. The initiative now includes more than 200 companies, has collectively hired nearly 400,000 veterans, and is focused on collectively hiring 1 million people. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired more than 11,000 veterans since 2011. We hope you feel as good about this initiative as we do. • We have accomplished an extraordinary amount in our Corporate Responsibility efforts. We take this responsibility very seriously, and, over the last decade, not only have we more than doubled our philanthropic giving from approximately 1616 I. THE JPMORGAN CHASE FRANCHISE $100 million to approximately $250 million in 2016, but we have dramati- cally increased our support with human capital, collaboration, data and manage- ment expertise. Our head of Corporate Responsibility talks about our significant measures in more detail in his letter, but I will highlight two initiatives below: − We provide tremendous support to cities and communities – espe- cially those left behind – and the best example is our work in Detroit. JPMorgan Chase has been doing busi- ness in Detroit for more than 80 years, and we watched as this iconic American city was engulfed in economic turmoil after years of decline. Just as Detroit was declaring bankruptcy, our company redoubled its efforts to help and, in 2014, announced our most comprehen- sive initiative to date – a $100 million investment in Detroit to help accelerate the city’s recovery. We are making strategic, coordinated investments focused on creating economically inclusive and revital- ized neighborhoods, preparing people with the skills needed for today’s high-quality jobs and providing small businesses with the capital they need to grow and succeed. This includes our investment in the Strategic Neighbor- hoods Fund, which brings together community developers and dedicated resources to create and maintain afford- able housing and deliver services to targeted communities. We also seeded the city’s first nonprofit real estate development firm focused exclusively on creating and preserving affordable housing in Detroit’s neighborhoods. In 2015, we helped create the $6.5 million Entrepreneurs of Color Fund with the Kellogg Foundation and Detroit Devel- opment Fund to bring critical financing and technical assistance to underserved minority- and community-based small businesses. In its first year, the Fund deployed almost $3 million in capital through more than 30 loans. We are also putting our talented employees to work in Detroit through the Detroit Service Corps. Since 2014, 68 JPMorgan Chase employees from 10 countries dedicated three intensive weeks to 16 Detroit nonprofits, helping them analyze challenges, solve problems and improve their chances for success. Detroit is making incredible progress as a result of the unprecedented spirit of engagement and cooperation among the city’s leaders, business commu- nity and nonprofit sectors. JPMorgan Chase is proud to be part of Detroit’s resurgence, and we believe a thriving Detroit economy will become a shining example of American resilience and ingenuity at work. − And more broadly, we created solutions for one of our country’s biggest chal- lenges – training the world’s work- force in the skills needed to compete in today’s economy. Through several targeted initiatives, JPMorgan Chase is investing over $325 million in demand- driven workforce development initia- tives around the world. Our programs build stronger labor markets that create economic opportunity, focusing on middle-skill jobs – positions that require a high school education, and often specialized training or certifica- tions, but not a college degree. These jobs – surgical technologists, diesel mechanics, help desk technicians and more – offer good wages and the chance to move up the economic ladder. Our goal is to increase the number of workers who have access to career path- ways, whether they are adults looking to develop new skills or younger workers starting to prepare for careers during high school and ending with postsecondary degrees or credentials aligned with good-paying, high-demand jobs. We are very proud that we can be a bridge between businesses and job seekers to support an economy that creates opportunity for everyone. 1717 II. We had a severe financial crisis followed by needed reform, and our financial system is now stronger and more resilient as a result. During and since the crisis, we’ve always supported thoughtful, effective regulation, not simply more or less. But it is an understatement to say improvements could be made. The regulatory environ- ment is unnecessarily complex, costly and sometimes confusing. No rational person could think that everything that was done was good, fair, sensible and effective, or coherent and consistent in creating a safer and stronger system. We believe (and many studies show) that poorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations have damaged our economy, inhibiting growth and jobs – and this has hurt the average American. We are not looking to throw out the entirety of Dodd-Frank or other rules (many of which were not specifically prescribed in Dodd- Frank). It is, however, appropriate to open up the rulebook in the light of day and rework the rules and regulations that don’t work well or are unnecessary. Rest assured, we will be responsibly and reasonably engaged on this front. We believe changes can and should be made that preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system and lead to a more healthy and vibrant economy for the benefit of all. There are some basic principles that should guide responsible regulation: • Coherence of rules to be coordinated both within and across regulatory agencies • Global harmonization of regulation to enhance fair trade and competition while helping eliminate any weak links in the global system • Simplified and proper risk-based capital standards • Consistent and transparent capital and liquidity rules • Regular and rigorous regulatory review, including consideration of costs vs. bene- fits, efficiencies, competitiveness, reduc- tion of redundant costs and assessment of impact on economic growth Adhering to these principles will maximize safety and soundness, increase competition and improve economic health. Since the financial crisis, thousands of new rules and regulations have been put into place by multiple regulators in the United States and around the world. An already complex system of financial oversight and supervision has grown even more complex – and this complexity can sometimes create even more risk. Many of these rules and regulations should be examined and possibly modified, but I will focus on the few that are critical in response to some of the questions and topics that follow. REGULATORY R EFORM 1818 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm 1. Talk about the strength and safety of the financial system and whether Too Big to Fail has been solved. There is no question that the system is safer and stronger today, and this is mostly due to the following factors: • Dramatically higher capital for almost all banks (we’ll talk later about how much capital is the appropriate amount) • Far higher liquidity for almost all banks (again, we’ll provide more details later in this section) • More disclosure and transparency – both to investors and regulators • More coordinated oversight within the United States and abroad • Far stronger compliance and control systems • Laws that allow regulators to step in to unwind not only failing banks but invest- ment banks (this did not exist for invest- ment banks prior to the financial crisis) • The creation of “bail-inable” unsecured debt – this converts debt into equity at the time of failure, immediately recapitalizing the failed bank • New rules that prohibit derivatives contracts from being voided at bankruptcy – this allows derivatives contracts to stay in place, creating an orderly transition to bankruptcy • Stress testing that monitors banks’ balance sheets and capital ratios under severely adverse scenarios (more on this below) • Requirements for banks and investment banks to prepare corporate recovery plans in the event of a crisis to prevent bank- ruptcy (these plans did not exist before the financial crisis) These changes taken together not only largely eliminate the chance of a major bank failing today but also prevent such failure from having a threatening domino effect on other banks and the economy as a whole. And if a major bank does fail, regula- tors have the necessary tools to manage it in an orderly way. Moreover, the banking industry itself has an inherent interest in the safety and soundness of the financial system because if there is a failure, the entire industry will be liable for that cost (more on that below). Essentially, Too Big to Fail has been solved — taxpayers will not pay if a bank fails. The American public has the right to demand that if a major bank fails, they, as taxpayers, would not have to pay for it, and the failure wouldn’t unduly harm the U.S. economy. In my view, these demands have now both been met. On the first count, if a bank fails, taxpayers do not pay. Shareholders and debtholders, now due to total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) rules, are at risk for all losses. To add belts and suspenders, if all that capital is not enough, the next and final line of defense is the industry itself, which is legally liable to pay any excess losses. (Notably, since 20o7, JPMorgan Chase alone has contributed $11.7 billion to the industry deposit fund.) On the second count, a regulatory takeover of a major bank would be orderly because regulators have the tools to manage it in the right way. It is instructive to look at what would happen if Lehman were to fail in today’s regulatory regime. First of all, it is highly unlikely the firm would fail because the new requirements would mean that instead of Lehman’s equity capital being $23 billion, which it was in 2007, it would be approxi- mately $45 billion under today’s capital rules. In addition, Lehman would have far stronger 1919 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm liquidity and “bail-inable” debt. And finally, the firm would be forced to raise capital much earlier in the process. If Lehman failed anyway, regulators would now have the legal authority to put the firm in receivership (they did not have that ability back in 2007–2008). The moment that happened, unsecured debt of approximately $120 billion would be immediately converted to equity. Derivatives contracts would not be triggered, and cash would continue to move through the pipes of the financial system. In other words, due to the living wills, Too Big to Fail was solved before any additional rules were put in place. (I’m not going to go into detail on the living wills but will say that while they have some positive elements, they have become unnecessarily complex and costly, and they need to be simplified.) Last, there is a new push for Chapter 14 bankruptcy for banks, which we at JPMorgan Chase support. This would provide specialized rules to quickly handle bankruptcy for banks. Whether a failed bank goes through Chapter 14, called “bankruptcy,” or Title II, called “resolution” – these are essentially the same thing – we should make the following point perfectly clear to the American people: A failed bank means the bank’s board and management are discharged, its equity is worthless, compensation is clawed back to the extent of the law and the bank’s name will forever be buried in the Hall of Shame. In addition, we should change the term “reso- lution” – as it sounds as if we are bailing out a failing bank (which couldn’t be further from the truth). Whatever the term is called, it should be made clear that the process is the same as bankruptcy in any other industry. One lesson from the prior crisis is that the American public will not be satisfied without “Old Testament Justice.” But market panic will never disappear entirely, and regulations must be flexible enough to allow banks to act as a bulwark against it rather than forcing financial institutions into a defensive crouch that will only make things worse. There will be market panic again, and it won’t affect just banks – it will affect the entire financial marketplace. Remember, banks were consistent providers of credit at existing prices into the crisis – the market was not. During the crisis, many companies could not raise money in the public markets, many securities did not trade, securities issu- ances dropped dramatically and many asset prices fell to valuation levels that virtually anticipated a Great Depression. Last time around, banks – in particular (and I say with pride) our bank – stood by their customers to provide capital and liquidity that helped them survive. However, today’s capital and liquidity rules have created rigidity that will actually hurt banks’ ability to stand against the tide as they did during the Great Reces- sion. This will mean that banks will survive the next market panic with plenty of cushion that could have been – but may not have been – used to help customers, companies and communities. It is in this environment that regulators need certain authorities to stop the situation from getting worse. One important point: Under both Chapter 14 and Title II, there might be a short-term need for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Fed to lend money, in the short run with proper collat- eral, to a failing or failed institution. This is because panic can cause a run on the bank, and it is far less painful to the economy if that bank’s assets are not sold in fire sales. This lending is effectively fully secured, and no loss should ever be incurred. Again, any loss that did occur would be charged back to all the banks. This also gives banks an enor- mous incentive to be in favor of a properly designed, safe and sound system. Going back to the principles above, putting safety and soundness first is clearly correct, but regulators also need the ability to take into consideration the costs and impact on our economy in various scenarios. 2020 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm 2. How and why should capital rules be changed? We need consistent, transparent, simplified and more risk-based capital standards. A healthy banking system needs consistent and transparent capital and liquidity rules that are based on simplified and proper risk-based standards. This allows banks to use capital intelligently and to properly plan capital levels over the years. Any rules that are capricious or that cause an arbitrary reduction in the value of a bank’s capital – and the value of the bank overall – can cause improper or inefficient risk taking. Finally, proper capital rules will allow a bank to do its job: to consistently finance the economy, in good times and, importantly, in bad times. There are more than 20 different major capital and liquidity requirements – and they often are inconsistent. For example, certain liquidity rules force a bank to hold an increasing amount of cash, essentially deposited at the Fed, but other rules require the bank to hold capital against this risk-free cash. An extraordinary number of calcula- tions need to be made as companies try to manage to avoid inadvertently violating one of the standards – a violation that rarely affects safety and soundness. To protect themselves, banks build enormous buffers – and buffers on top of buffers – or otherwise take unnecessary actions to ensure that they don’t step over the line.

We have a fortress balance sheet — far more than the numbers imply. The chart on page 20 shows the dramatic improvement in our capital and liquidity numbers since 2008. Remember, we had enough capital and liquidity in 2008 to easily handle the crisis that ensued. The numbers are even better than they look on the chart for the following reasons: • In 2008, there was no such thing as operational risk capital (not to say there wasn’t operational risk but just that capital was not applied to it). If you measured our capital ratio on the same basis as in 2008 (that is, on an apples to apples basis), we wouldn’t have just 12.2% today vs. 7% in 2008 – we would have 16.7% today vs. 7% in 2008. • Since 2008, the regulatory definition of liquidity has been prescribed. Now, only deposits at a central bank, Treasuries and government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (plus a limited amount of sovereign and corporate bonds) count as liquidity. Many securities are not allowed to count as liquidity today – on the theory that they can sustain losses and occasion- ally become illiquid. While maybe not all 100% of the current value of these securi- ties should apply toward liquidity require- ments, they should count for something. If you did combine all of these categories as liquidity, our liquidity at JPMorgan Chase would have gone from $300 billion in 2008 to $786 billion today. And remember, our deposits – theoretically subject to “run on the bank” risk – total $1.4 trillion. Even in the Great Recession, the worst case for a bank was only a 30% loss of its deposits. • Finally, when you include long-term debt and preferred stock as loss absorbing capital, our total capital 2 is approximately $500 billion vs. true risk-weighted assets of $1.1 trillion. 3 Essentially, since 2008, our total capital has gone from $387 billion to $500 billion, while actual risk-weighted assets have declined to $1.1 trillion. In addition to our fortress balance sheet, we are well-diversified, and we have healthy margins and strong controls. These are all factors that dramatically improve safety and soundness, but they are not included in any measures. As you will see below, we can handle almost any stress. We believe in stress testing, but it could be improved and simplified. As you know, the Fed puts our company through one “severely adverse” stress test annually, which determines how we can use our capital, pay dividends, buy back stock and expand. We are great believers in stress testing but would like to make the following points: • Our shareholders should know that we don’t rely on one stress test a year – we conduct more than 200 each week across all of our riskiest exposures. We meet weekly; we analyze each exposure in multiple ways; we are extremely risk conscious. • The Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test estimates what our losses would be through a severely adverse event lasting over nine quarters, which approximates the severity and time of the Great Recession; e.g., high unem- ployment, counterparty failures, etc. The Fed estimates that in such a scenario, we would lose $31 billion over the ensuing nine quarters, which is easily manageable by JPMorgan Chase’s capital base. My own view is that we would make money in almost every quarter in that type of environment, and this is supported by our having earned approximately $30 billion pre-tax over the course of the nine quarters during the real financial crisis. 2222 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm We don’t completely understand the Fed’s assumptions and models – the Fed does not share them with us (we hope there will be more transparency and clarity in the future). But we do understand that the Fed’s stress test shows results far worse than our own test because the Fed’s stress test is not a fore- cast of what you actually think will happen. Instead, it appropriately makes additional assumptions about a company’s likelihood to fail – that its trading losses will be far worse than expected, etc. The Fed wants to make sure the bank has enough capital if just about everything goes wrong. Finally, while we firmly believe banks should have a proper assessment of their qualitative abilities, this should not be part of a once-a- year stress test. Instead, it should be part of the Fed’s regular exam process. The Fed and the banks should work together to continu- ously improve the quality of their processes while creating a consistent, safe and econ- omy-growing use of capital. It is clear that the banks have too much capital. Here is another critical point: The Fed’s stress test of the 33 major banks estimates what each bank would lose assuming it were the worst bank in the crisis, which, of course, will not be true in the real world. But even if that happened, the chart below shows that if you combine all the banks’ extreme losses, the total losses add up to less than 10% of the banks’ combined capital. This definitively proves that there is excess capital in the system. And more of that capital can be safely used to finance the economy. Proper calibration of capital is critical to ensure not only that the system is safe and sound but that banks can use their capital to finance the economy. And we think it’s clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness. Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses, banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages. 1 Includes 2013’s 18 participating CCAR banks as well as Bear Stearns, Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, National City, Wachovia and Washington Mutual.

RegulatoR y RefoRm The global systemically important bank (GSIB) and supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) rules need to be modified. The GSIB capital surcharge forces large banks to add even more capital, based on some very complex calculations that are highly flawed and not risk based. In fact, the rules often penalize fairly risk-free activity, such as deposits held at the Fed and short-term secured financing. Likewise, the SLR rules force capital to be held on deposit at the Fed in Treasury securities and in other liquid securities. Neither calculation gives credit for operating margins, diversification or annuity streams of business. These calculations should, at a minimum, be significantly modified and balanced to promote lending and other policy goals, including maintaining deep and liquid capital markets, clearing derivatives and directing more private capital in the mortgage market. Operational risk capital should be significantly modified, if not eliminated. No one could credibly argue that there is no such thing as operational risk, separate and distinct from credit and market risk. All busi- nesses have operational risk (trucks crash, computers fail, lawsuits happen, etc.), but almost all businesses successfully manage it through their operating earnings and general resources. Basel standards required banks to hold capital for operational risk, and the United States “gold plated” this calculation. Banks in the United States in total now hold approximately $200 billion in operational risk capital. For us, we hold excess operational risk capital which is not being utilized to support our economy. It was an unnecessarily large add-on. If you are going to have operational risk capital, it should be forward looking, fairly calculated, coordinated with other capital rules and consistent with reality. (Currently, if you exit a business that created operational risk capital, you are still, most likely, required to hold the operational risk capital.) Finally, America should eliminate its “gold plating” of international standards. American regulators took the new Basel standards across a wide variety of calcula- tions and asked for more. If JPMorgan Chase could use the same international standards as other international banks, it would free up a material amount of capital. The removal of the GSIB surcharge “gold plating” alone would free up $15 billion of equity capital – an amount that could support almost $190 billion of loans. In addition, America gold plated operational risk capital, liquidity rules, SLR rules and TLAC rules. Later in this letter, we will discuss international standards. Properly done and improved, modifying many of these regulatory standards could help finance the growth of the American economy without damaging the safety and soundness of the system. 3. How do certain regulatory policies impact money markets? Different from most banks, money center banks help large institutions – including governments, investors and large money market funds – move short-term funds around the system to where those funds are needed most. The recipients of these funds include financial institutions (including non- money center banks) and corporations that can have large daily needs to invest or borrow. The products that money center banks offer large institutions are predominantly deposits, securities, money market funds and short- term overnight investments called repurchase agreements. These involve enormous flows of funds, which money center banks handle easily, carefully and securely. They are gener- ally match-funded 4, almost no credit risk is taken, and most lending is done wholly and properly secured by Treasuries or govern- ment-guaranteed securities. These transac- tions represent a large part of JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet. Because of new rules, capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities, and we believe this has caused distortions in the marketplace. For example: 4Match-funding ensures that the risk characteristics — e.g., interest rate, maturity — of the asset (e.g., loan) are offset by the liability (e.g., deposit) funding it. 2424 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm • Swap spreads, for the first time in history, turned negative, which means that corpo- rations need to pay a lot more to hedge their interest rate exposure. • Reduction in broker-dealer inventories has impacted liquidity. • Many banks reject certain types of large deposits from some of their large institu- tional clients. In a peculiar twist of fate – and something difficult for our clients to understand – through 2016, JPMorgan Chase turned away 3,200 large clients and $200 billion of their deposits even though we could have taken them without incurring any risk whatsoever (we simply would have deposited the $200 billion at the central bank). The charts below shows some of the reduc- tion in banks’ market-making abilities. We need to work closely with regulators to assess the impact of the new rules on specific markets, the cost and volatility of liquidity, and the potential cost of credit. We should be able to make some modest changes that in no way impact safety and soundness but improve markets. 4. How has regulation affected monetary policy, the flow of bank credit and the growth of the economy? It is extremely important that we analyze how new capital and liquidity rules affect the creation of credit; i.e., lending. We have yet to see thorough, thoughtful analysis on this subject by economists – because in this case, it is very hard to calculate what might have been counterfactual. However, it seems clear that if banks had been able to use more of their capital and liquidity, they would have been more aggressive in terms of expanding: Think of additional bankers, bank branches and geographies, which likely would have led to additional lending. (On the following pages, we make it clear that this would have been the case in mortgage lending.) I would like to focus on how liquidity policies may have impacted the effectiveness of mone- tary policy and lending. The chart on page 25 shows bank loans vs. bank deposits from 2006 to 2016. During the last several decades, deposits and loans were mostly balanced. You can see that stopped being true after the start of the Great Recession. Today, loans are approximately $2 trillion less than deposits.

RegulatoR y RefoRm Many factors may influence this scenario, but there are two arguments at the bookends about why this happened: • There was simply not enough loan demand due to a slow-growing economy. • The new liquidity rules require banks to hold approximately $2 trillion at the Federal Reserve, whether or not there is loan demand. It is evident that banks reduced certain types of lending legitimately – think of some of the inappropriate subprime mortgage lending – but banks cut back on other types of lending as well because of the new rules; for example, small business lending due to CCAR and cross-border lending because of GSIB. The ensuing discussion shows how other regula- tory rules dramatically decreased mortgage lending, again slowing down the economy. It is clear that the transmission of monetary policy is different today from what it was in the past because of new capital and liquidity rules. What is not clear is how much these rules reduced lending. Again, working together, we should be able to figure it out and make appropriate improvements that enhance economic growth without damaging the safety of the system. 5. How can we reform mortgage markets to give qualified borrowers access to the credit they need? Much of what we consider good in America – a good job, stability and community involvement – is represented in the achieve- ment of homeownership. Owning a home is still the embodiment of the American Dream, and it is commonly the most important asset that most families have. So it is no surprise the financial crisis, which was caused in part by poor mortgage lending practices and which caused so much pain for American families and businesses, led to new regulations and enhanced supervi- sion. We needed to create a safer and better functioning mortgage industry. However, our Source: Haver; Federal Reserve Bank Bank Loans and Bank Deposits 2006–2016 ($ in trillions) $0.0 $2.0 $4.0 $6.0 $8.0 $10.0 $12.0 $14.0 /UIstopBank loans /UIstopBank deposits 20162015201420132012201120102009200820072006 2626 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm housing sector has been unusually slow to recover, and that may be partly due to restric- tions in mortgage credit. Seven major federal regulators and a long list of state and local regulators have overlapping jurisdiction on mortgage laws and wrote a plethora of new rules and regulations appro- priately focused on educating and protecting customers. While some of the rules are beneficial, many were hastily developed and layered upon existing rules without coordina- tion or calibration as to the potential effects. The result is a complex, highly risky and unpredictable operating environment that exposes lenders and servicers to dispropor- tionate legal liability and materially increases operational risks and costs. These actions resulted in: • Mortgages that cost the consumer more • A tightening credit box; i.e., mortgage lenders are less likely to extend credit to borrowers without a strong credit history • An inhibition of the return of private capital to the housing industry • The crowding out of resources to improve technology and the customer experience The chart below and the top chart on page 27 show the decline in lending to individuals with lower credit scores.

RegulatoR y RefoRm There are significant opportunities to make simple changes that can have a dramatic impact on improving the current state of the home lending industry – this will make access to good and affordable mortgages much more achievable for far more Americans. And it’s noteworthy that those who lost access to mortgage credit are the very ones who so many people profess to want to help – e.g., lower income buyers, first-time homebuyers, the self-employed and individuals with prior defaults who deserve another chance. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) reform can bring banks back and expand access to credit. The FHA plays a significant role in providing credit for first-time, low- to moderate-income and minority homebuyers. However, aggres- sive use of the False Claims Act (FCA) (a Civil War act passed to protect the govern- ment from intentional fraud) and overly complex regulations have made FHA lending risky and cost prohibitive for many banks. In fact, FCA settlements wiped out a decade of FHA profitability, and subsequent losses Comparison of New Home Sales by Price Range Benchmark (1x = January 2010 sales levels) 0x 1x 2x 3x 4x 5x 6x 20152005 20102000 /UIstopOver $300,000 /UIstopUnder $300,000 Source: Haver; U.S. Census Bureau Average FICO of Newly Originated 30-Year Purchase Loans, for the GSEs and FHA GSE = Government-sponsored enterprise FHA = Federal Housing Administration Source: Freddie Mac, The Federal Housing Administration 625 650 675 700 725 750 775 2016201520142013201220112010200920082007 /UIstopGSE /UIstopFHA 70 point increase 40 point increase 2828 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm have kept returns on capital solidly below our target. This has led us to scale back our participation in the FHA lending program in favor of less burdensome lending programs that serve the same consumer base – and we are not alone. The chart above shows that nonbanks have gone from 20% to 80% of FHA originations. A first step to increasing participation in the FHA program could be the communication of support for only using the FCA, as originally intended, to penalize intentional fraud rather than immaterial or unintentional errors. Other changes that would help would be: • Improve and fully implement the Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) proposed defect taxonomy, clarifying liability for fraudulent activity. • Revise certification requirements to make them more commercially reasonable. • Simplify loss mitigation by allowing streamlined programs and aligning with industry standards. • Eliminate costly, unnecessary and outdated requirements that make the cost of servicing an FHA loan significantly more expensive than a conventional loan. Mortgage servicing is too complex: National servicing standards would help. Mortgage servicing is a particularly complex business in which the cumulative impact of regulations has dramatically increased operational and compliance risk and costs (remember that costs are usually passed on to the customer). Mortgage servicing starts immediately after loan origination (loan origination also has become signifi- cantly more expensive and complex as a result of regulatory changes) and involves a continuing and dynamic relationship among a servicer, customer and investor or guar- antor, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or FHA, to name a few. New mortgage rules and regulations total more than 14,000 pages and stand about six feet tall. In servicing alone, there are thou- sands of pages of federal and state servicing rules now – clearly driving up complexity and cost. The Mortgage Bankers Associa- tion estimated the fully loaded annual cost of industry servicing, as of 2015, to be $181 for a performing mortgage and $2,386 for a mortgage in default. The cost of servicing a defaulted loan is so high that many servicers avoid underwriting loans that have even a modest probability of default.

RegulatoR y RefoRm reason why mortgage companies avoid under- writing certain types of mortgages today than they would have underwritten in the past. The most promising opportunity in mort- gage servicing is to adopt uniform national servicing standards across guarantors, federal and state regulators, and investors. Importantly, there is no need for legislation to implement the necessary coordination to get this done. In particular, the U.S. Treasury is well-positioned to lead key players in the mortgage industry (the Consumer Finan- cial Protection Bureau, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, HUD, the FHA, the Veterans Administra- tion, Ginnie Mae and the U.S. Department of Agriculture) to establish national service standards that would simplify mortgage origination and servicing. Treasury played a similarly pivotal leadership role during the crisis when it helped develop the various mortgage assistance initiatives, such as the loan modification and streamlined refinance programs that allowed many Americans to stay in their homes and communities. Private capital needs to return in order to make the market less taxpayer dependent — we need to complete the securitization standards. Private capital in the mortgage industry, particularly in the form of securitizations, dried up as a result of the financial crisis. Eight years later, we still have not opened up a healthy securitization market because of our inability to finalize the rules. Not only does this reduce the share of private capital in the U.S. housing sector (an action that would significantly reduce taxpayer expo- sure), it also significantly increases the cost to the customer. Taking a few actions would fix this, including: • Rationalize capital requirements on securi- tizations to effectively transfer risk to the market while leaving “skin in the game” with the originator. • Reduce the complexity of data delivery requirements. • Clarify and define materiality standards associated with compliance with laws and regulations, as well as underwriting stan- dards, to allow for reasonable protections from litigation and to enable standardized due diligence practices. If we do this right, we believe the mortgage market could add more than $300 billion a year in new purchased loans. If we take the actions mentioned above, we believe that the cost to a customer would be 20 basis points lower and that mortgage underwriters would be willing to take more – but appropriate – risk on loans (again, this would be for first-time, young and lower income buyers, those with prior delinquen- cies but who are now in good financial standing and those who are self-employed). Taken in total, we believe the issues identi- fied above have reduced mortgage lending by more than $300 billion purchased mortgages annually (our analysis deliberately excludes underwriting the subprime and Alt-A mort- gages that caused so many problems in the Great Recession). Had we been able to fix these issues five years ago (i.e., three years after the crisis), our analysis shows that, conservatively, more than $1 trillion in mort- gage loans might have been made. If this is true, it may explain why our housing sector has been unusually slow to recover: $1 trillion of new mortgage loans is approxi- mately 3 million loans. Of these, typically more than 20% would go to purchase new homes that would need to be built. By any estimate, this could have had a significant impact on the growth of jobs and gross domestic product (GDP). Our economists think that $1 trillion of loans could have increased GDP, in each of those five years, by 0.5%. In the next section, we will talk about how this is just one of the many things we did to damage our nation’s economy. 3030 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm 6. How can we reduce complexity and create a more coherent regulatory system? We created a massively complex system in which multiple regulators have overlap- ping responsibilities on virtually every issue, including rulemaking, examination, auditing and enforcement. This is extremely taxing, complex and overly burdensome for banks, customers of banks and regulators. Dodd-Frank appropriately established the Financial Services Oversight Committee (FSOC) and assigned to it the responsibility of general oversight across the entire finan- cial system. Unfortunately, the FSOC was not given the ability to adjudicate issues or assign responsibility. Therefore, the FSOC is unable to fully resolve some of the problems that we have detailed in this letter. Finally, another flaw is that some of the laws were written in a way that left them open to broad interpretation and novel enforcement. There is too much complexity in the system — it could be fixed, and that would make the system stronger. Nearly everyone agrees there is too much complexity in the current construct of the financial system. A few examples will suffice: • There are multiple calculations of capital, living wills, the Volcker Rule, etc. • There are multiple regulators involved independently in rulemaking – just two examples: Seven regulators are involved in setting mortgage regulations, and five regulators oversee the Volcker Rule. This leads to slow rulemaking (e.g., as noted above, we still have not finished the mort- gage rules eight years after the crisis), excessive reporting and varied interpreta- tions on what the actual rules are. • Each agency makes separate audit and reporting demands and can indepen- dently take enforcement action on the same subject. This is clearly a dysfunctional structure. The fix is simple – though getting it done may not be: • The system should be simplified. There should be one primary regulator on any issue, and we should always strive to make things as simple as possible. • The primary regulator should establish the rules, the reporting requirements, the audit plans and the enforcement action. Other regulators should get involved only if they believe the primary person did a particularly poor job. • Everything in the regulatory landscape should be reviewed in the context of safety and soundness, cost-benefit analysis and economic growth. The FSOC is a good idea but needs to be modified to be more effective. It makes sense for regulators to be continu- ously reviewing the entire financial system in an effort to make it as safe and sound as possible (think of this as a well-functioning risk committee of a major bank). But the FSOC should be given some authority to assign responsibility, adjudicate disagree- ments, set deadlines and force the reso- lution of critical issues. The FSOC could also enforce due consideration of regula- tions’ costs vs. benefits and the impact on economic growth. We have great sympathy for, and agree with, the complaints of the community banks. They are struggling to deal with the complexity and cost of meeting these requirements – and we agree these smaller banks should be relieved of many of the requirements. Enhancing the functionality of the FSOC and providing regulatory relief where appro- priate should not be a political issue. The administration is currently conducting a review of the rules and regulations, which are burdensome and duplicative and which may impede economic growth. That process should be as de-politicized as possible. Everyone stands to gain when growth is enabled in a safe and sound manner. 3131 II. RegulatoR y RefoRm 7. How can we harmonize regulations across the globe? Currently, American regulators have been pushing the Basel Committee – the interna- tional forum that is supposed to set inter- national financial regulatory guidelines – to meet the even higher American standards around capital requirements, derivatives rules, risk-weight calculations, stress testing and other requirements. Many other coun- tries around the world are telling Basel that it has gone too far and that it’s time to let the banks focus on healthy lending and growth of the economy. Following are a few principles that we think should guide global regulations and international coordination to increase safety and soundness and foster global growth: • International regulations should be coherent and generally harmonized around the world – but they don’t need to be exactly the same. • We should recognize where there are legit- imate reasons to do something different. For example, certain types of loans legiti- mately could draw different risk weighting in various countries based on historical performance, collateral and bankruptcy laws or even culture. • Cross-border financial rules need to be part of trade negotiations like any other product or service. We know we will be increasingly competing with Chinese banks, and, eventually, we need the U.S. government to make that part of our trade agreement. • We can acknowledge that the state of affairs in different countries, including in their banks and their economies, may differ and that these differences might warrant idiosyncratic regulatory responses. For example, European banks for eight years have consistently been put in the position of having to raise more and more capital and liquidity or having to reduce their lending capacity. While their capital standards may have been low compared with American standards (particularly in how they calculate risk- weighted assets), this deleveraging has to have hurt the growth of European econo- mies and opportunities for their people. These banks started from a different posi- tion (which had been sanctioned by both their regulators and governments years ago), and we agree that these banks should be allowed to do their job. Most of these banks have plenty of total capital. While it might be true that one day they should have more, the moral imperative now is to help their economies grow and to help the people of those countries. We are completely convinced that if we can rationally change and coordinate many of these rules, banks can do even more to help the economy thrive. 3232 Before we address some of the critical issues confronting our country, it would be good to count our blessings. Let’s start with a serious assessment of our strengths. III. America today is probably stronger than ever before. For example: • The United States has the world’s stron- gest military, and this will be the case for decades. We are fortunate to be at peace with our neighbors and to have the protec- tion of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. • As a nation, we have essentially all the food, water and energy we need. • The United States has among the world’s best universities and hospitals. • The United States has a generally reliable rule of law and low corruption. • The government of the United States is the world’s longest surviving democracy, which has been steadfast, resilient and enduring through some very difficult times. • The people of the United States have a great work ethic and can-do attitude. • Americans are among the most entrepre- neurial and innovative people in the world – from those who work on the factory PUBLIC POLICY 2. But it is clear that something is wrong — and it’s holding us back. Our economy has been growing much more slowly in the last decade or two than in the 50 years before then. From 1948 to 2000, real per capita GDP grew 2.3%; from 2000 to 2016, it grew 1%. Had it grown at 2.3% instead of 1% in those 17 years, our GDP per capita would be 24%, or more than $12,500 per person higher than it is. U.S. productivity growth tells much the same story, as shown in the chart on page 33. Our nation’s lower growth has been accom- panied by – and may be one of the reasons why – real median household incomes in 2015 were actually 2.5% lower than they were in 1999. In addition, the percentage of middle class households has actually shrunk over time. In 1971, 61% of households were considered middle class, but that percentage was only 50% in 2015. And for those in the bottom 20% of earners – mainly lower skilled workers – the story may be even 1. The United States of America is truly an exceptional country. floors to geniuses like the late Steve Jobs. Improving “things” and increasing productivity are American pastimes. And America still fosters an entrepreneurial culture, which allows risk taking – and acknowledges that it can result in success or failure. • The United States is home to many of the best, most vibrant businesses on the planet – from small and midsized compa- nies to large, global multinationals. • The United States has the widest, deepest, most transparent and best financial markets in the world. And I’m not talking about just Wall Street and banks – I include the whole mosaic: venture capital, private equity, asset managers, individual and corporate investors, and public and private capital markets. Our financial markets have been an essential part of the great American business machine. Very few countries, if any, are as blessed as we are. 3333 III. PUBLIC POLICY worse. For this group, real incomes declined by more than 8% between 1999 and 2015. In 1984, 60% of families could afford a modestly priced home. By 2009, that figure fell to about 50%. This drop occurred even though the percentage of U.S. citizens with a high school degree or higher increased from 30% to 50% from 1980 to 2013. Low-skilled labor just doesn’t earn what it used to, which understandably is a source of real frustration for a very meaningful group of people. The income gap between lower skilled and skilled workers has been growing and may be the inevitable consequence of an increasingly sophisticated economy. Regarding reduced social mobility, researchers have found that the likelihood of workers moving to the top-earning decile from starting positions in the middle of the earnings distribution has declined by approx- imately 20% since the early 1980s. Many economists believe we are now permanently relegated to slower growth and lower productivity (they say that secular stagnation is the new normal), but I strongly disagree. We will describe in the rest of this section many factors that are rarely considered in economic models although they can have an enormous effect on growth and productivity. Making this list was an upsetting exercise, especially since many of our problems have been self-inflicted. That said, it was also a good reminder of how much of this is in our control and how critical it is that we focus on all the levers that could be pulled to help the U.S. economy. We must do this because it will help all Americans. Many other, often non-economic, factors impact growth and productivity. Following is a list of some non-economic items that must have had a significant impact on America’s growth: • Over the last 16 years, we have spent tril- lions of dollars on wars when we could have been investing that money produc- tively. (I’m not saying that money didn’t need to be spent; but every dollar spent on battle is a dollar that can’t be put to use elsewhere.) • Since 2010, when the government took over student lending, direct government lending to students has gone from approx- imately $200 billion to more than $900 billion – creating dramatically increased student defaults and a population that is rightfully angry about how much money they owe, particularly since it reduces their ability to get other credit.

PUBLIC POLICY • Our nation’s healthcare costs are essen- tially twice as much per person vs. most other developed nations. • It is alarming that approximately 40% (this is an astounding 300,000 students each year) of those who receive advanced degrees in science, technology, engi- neering and math at American universi- ties are foreign nationals with no legal way of staying here even when many would choose to do so. We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here. • Felony convictions for even minor offenses have led, in part, to 20 million American citizens having a criminal record – and this means they often have a hard time getting a job. (There are six times more felons in the United States than in Canada.) • The inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mortgage avail- ability. We estimate that mortgages alone would have been more than $1 trillion higher had we had healthier mortgage markets. Greater mortgage access would have led to more homebuilding and addi- tional jobs and investments, which also would have driven additional growth. Any one of these non-economic factors is fairly material in damaging America’s effort to achieve healthy growth. Let’s dig a little bit deeper into six additional unsettling issues that have also limited our growth rate. Labor force participation is too low. Labor force participation in the United States has gone from 66% to 63% between 2008 and today. Some of the reasons for this decline are understandable and aren’t too worrisome – for example, an aging popula- tion. But if you examine the data more closely and focus just on labor force participation for one key segment; i.e., men ages 25-54, you’ll see that we have a serious problem. The chart below shows that in America, the participa- tion rate for that cohort has gone from 96% in 1968 to a little over 88% today. This is way below labor force participation in almost every other developed nation.

PUBLIC POLICY If the work participation rate for this group went back to just 93% – the current average for the other developed nations – approxi- mately 10 million more people would be working in the United States. Some other highly disturbing facts include: Fifty-seven percent of these non-working males are on disability, and fully 71% of today’s youth (ages 17–24) are ineligible for the military due to a lack of proper education (basic reading or writing skills) or health issues (often obesity or diabetes). Education is leaving too many behind. Many high schools and vocational schools do not provide the education our students need – the goal should be to graduate and get a decent job. We should be ringing the national alarm bell that inner city schools are failing our children – often minorities and children from lower income households. In many inner city schools, fewer than 60% of students graduate, and many of those who do graduate are not prepared for employ- ment. We are creating generations of citizens who will never have a chance in this land of dreams and opportunity. Unfortunately, it’s self-perpetuating, and we all pay the price. The subpar academic outcomes of America’s minority and low-income children resulted in yearly GDP losses of trillions of dollars, according to McKinsey & Company. Infrastructure needs planning and investment. In the early 1960s, America was considered by most to have the best infrastructure (highways, ports, water supply, electrical grid, airports, tunnels, etc.). The World Economic Forum now ranks the United States #27 on its Basic Requirements index, reflecting infrastructure along with other criteria, among 138 countries. On infrastruc- ture, the United States is behind most major developed countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Korea. The American Society of Civil Engineers releases a report every four years examining current infra- structure conditions and needs – the 2017 report card gave us a grade of D+. Another interesting and distressing fact: The United States has not built a major airport in more than 20 years. China, on the other hand, has built 75 new civilian airports in the last 10 years alone. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas. America now has the highest corporate tax rates among developed nations. Most other developed nations have reduced their tax rates substantially over the past 10 years (and this is true whether looking at statu- tory or effective tax rates). This is causing considerable damage. American corpora- tions are generally better off investing their capital overseas, where they can earn a higher return because of lower taxes. In addition, foreign companies are advantaged when they buy American companies – often they are able to reduce the overall tax rate of the combined company. Because of this, American companies have been making substantial investments in human capital, as well as in plants, facilities, research and development (R&D) and acquisitions overseas. Also, American corporations hold more than $2 trillion in cash abroad to avoid the additional taxes. The only ques- tion is how much damage will be done before we fix this. Reducing corporate taxes would incent busi- ness investment and job creation. The charts on page 36 show the following: • That job growth is highly correlated to business investment (this also makes intuitive sense). • That fixed investments by businesses and capital formation have gone down substantially and are far below what we would consider normal. 3636 III.

PUBLIC POLICY And counterintuitively, reducing corporate taxes would also improve wages. One of the unintended consequences of high corporate taxes is that they actually depress wages in the United States. A 2007 Treasury Depart- ment review finds that labor “may bear a substantial portion of the burden from the corporate income tax.” A study by Kevin Hassett from the American Enterprise Institute finds that each $1 increase in U.S. corporate income tax collections leads to a $2 decrease in wages in the short run and a $4 decrease in aggregate wages in the long run. And analysis of the U.S. corporate income tax by the Congressional Budget Office finds that labor bears more than 70% of the burden of the corporate income tax, with the remaining 30% borne by domestic savers through a reduced return on their savings. We must fix this for the benefit of American competitive- ness and all Americans. Excessive regulations reduce growth and business formation. Everyone agrees we should have proper regu- lation – and, of course, good regulations have many positive effects. But anyone in business understands the damaging effects of over- complicated and inefficient regulations. There are many ways to look at regulations, and the chart below and the two on page 38 provide some insight. The one below shows the total pages of federal regulations, which is a simple way to illustrate additional reporting and compliance requirements. The second records how we compare with the rest of the world on the ease of starting a new business – we used to be among the best, and now we are not. The bottom chart on page 38 shows that small businesses now report that one of their largest problems is regulations. By some estimates, approximately $2 tril- lion is spent on regulations annually (which is approximately $15,000 per U.S. household annually). 5 And even if this number is exag- 5 Crews, Clyde Wayne, Jr. (2016).

PUBLIC POLICY gerated, it highlights a disturbing problem. Particularly troubling is that this may be one of the reasons why small business creation has slowed alarmingly in recent years. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the rising burdens of federal regulations alone may be a main reason for a falling pace in new business formation. In 1980, Americans were creating some 450,000 new companies a year. In 2013, they formed 400,000 new busi- nesses despite a 40% increase in population from 1980 to 2013. Our three-decade slump in company formation fell to its lowest point with the onset of the Great Recession; even with more businesses being established today, America’s startup activity remains below pre- recession levels. /UIstopU.S. vs. World /UIstopU.S. vs. OECD Harder Easier 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2017201620152014201320122011201020092008200720062005 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 20142010200620021998199419901986 /UIstopTaxes /UIstopQuality of labor /UIstopPoor sales /UIstopRegulation Source: Haver; National Federation of Independent Business Source: World Bank Doing Business; J.P.

PUBLIC POLICY While some regulations quite clearly create a common good (e.g., clean air and water), it is clear that excessive regulation does not help productivity, growth of the economy or job creation. And even regulations that once may have made sense may no longer be fit for the purpose. I am not going to outline specific recommendations about non-financial regulatory reform here, other than to say that we should have a perma- nent and systematic review of the costs and benefits of regulations, including their intended vs. unintended consequences. The lack of economic growth and opportunity has led to deep and understandable frustration among so many Americans. Low job growth, a lack of opportunity for many, declining wages, students and low- wage workers being left behind, economic and job uncertainty, high healthcare costs and growing income inequality all have created deep frustration. It is understand- able why so many are angry at the leaders of America’s institutions, including businesses, schools and governments – they are right to expect us to do a better job. Collectively, we are the ones responsible. Additionally, this can understandably lead to disenchantment with trade, globalization and even our free enterprise system, which for so many people seems not to have worked. Our problems are significant, and they are not the singular purview of either political party. We need coherent, consistent, compre- hensive and coordinated policies that help fix these problems. The solutions are not binary – they are not either/or, and they are not about Democrats or Republicans. They are about facts, analysis, ideas and best practices (including what we can learn from others around the world). We need to work together to improve work skills. I cannot in this letter tackle the complex set of issues confronting our inner city schools, but I do know that if we don’t acknowledge these problems, we will never fix them. Whether they graduate from high school, vocational or training school or go on to college, our students can and should be adequately prepared for good, decent-paying jobs. And whether a student graduates from high school, vocational school or training school, the graduate should have a sense of pride and accomplishment – and meaningful employment opportunities, without forgoing the chance to go to college later on. Career and technical education specifically can give young people the skills they need for decent- paying roles in hundreds of fields, including aviation, robotics, medical science, welding, accounting and coding – all jobs that are in demand today. In New York City, not far from where I grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, there’s a school called Aviation High School. Students travel from all over the city to go to the school (with a 97% student attendance rate), where they are trained in many facets of aviation, from how to maintain an aircraft to the details of the plane’s electronics, hydraulics and electrical systems. And when the students graduate (93% graduated in the normal four years), they get a job, often earning an annual starting salary of approximately $60,000. It’s a great example of what we should be promoting in our educational system. Businesses must be involved in this process. They need to partner with schools to let them know what skills are needed, help develop the appropriate curricula, help train teachers and be prepared to hire the students. In addition, this has to be done locally because that is where the actual jobs are. Germany does this well. Germany has 3. How can we start investing in our people to help them be more productive and share in the opportunities and rewards of our economy? 4040 III. PUBLIC POLICY one of the strongest education and training systems in the world, with about 1.5 million young people every year participating in apprenticeship programs that are paid oppor- tunities to gain in-demand skills along with an education. The vocational schools and apprenticeship programs work directly with local businesses to ensure the students are connected to available jobs upon graduation. As a result of this market-driven vocational training, Germany’s youth unemployment rate is also one of the lowest in the world. There is nothing wrong with learning from other countries. Proper skills training also can be used to continuously re-educate American workers. Many people are afraid that automation is taking away jobs. Let’s be clear. Technology is the best thing that ever happened to mankind, and it is the reason the world is getting progressively better. But we should acknowledge that though technology helps everyone generally, it does cause some job loss, dislocation and disruption in specific areas. Retraining is the best way to help those disrupted by advancements in technology. We need to help lower skilled workers earn a living wage while helping small businesses. Business should support an expanded EITC. There is a tax credit in the United States called the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which supplements low-paid workers’ incomes. For example, a single mother with two children earning $9 an hour (approxi- mately $20,000 a year) could get a tax credit of more than $5,000 at the end of the year. A single man without children could get a tax credit under this program of only about $500. This program has flaws (which we believe could be fixed), but it has lifted an estimated 9 million people above the poverty line. (The federal poverty guideline is deter- mined by household size. For a four-person household, the poverty level is $24,600 or approximately $11 an hour.) Last year, the EITC program cost the United States about $67 billion, and there were 27 million indi- viduals who received the credit. Approximately 20.6 million American workers earn between $7.25 an hour (the prevailing federal minimum wage) and $10.10 an hour. Approximately 42% of Amer- ican workers make less than $15 an hour. I believe we should dramatically expand the EITC to help more low-paid individuals, with and without children, earn a living wage. I have no doubt that this will entice more workers back into the workforce. Jobs bring dignity. That first job is often the first rung on the ladder. And studies show that once people start working, they continue working. In addition, living wages lead to less crime, more household formation and, it is hoped, better social outcomes, including more marriages and children and better health and overall well-being. It is important to note that large companies generally pay well above the minimum wage and provide health insurance and retire- ment benefits to all their employees. They also extensively train their employees and help them move along in their careers. While this would help small businesses far more than big businesses, large companies should support the expansion of this program because it would foster growth and be great for lower paid American workers. 4. What should our country be doing to invest in its infrastructure? How does the lack of a plan and investment hurt our economy? Infrastructure in America is a very broad and complex subject. However, we do have a few suggestions on how to make it better. Similar to companies planning for capacity needs, it is quite clear that cities, states and the federal government can also plan around their somewhat predictable needs for main- tenance, new roads and bridges, increasing electrical requirements and other necessities to serve a growing population. Infrastruc- ture should not be a stop-start process but an ongoing endeavor whereby intelligent invest- 4141 III. PUBLIC POLICY ments are made continuously. And the plan could also be sped up if necessary to help a weakening economy. Infrastructure, which could have a life of five to 50 years, should not be expensed as a government debt but should be accounted for as an investment that could be financed separately. Borrowing money for consump- tion is completely different from borrowing for something that has value for a long period of time. It’s important to streamline the approval process, and approvals should run simultane- ously and not sequentially. Last, we need to assure that we have good infrastructure and not bridges to nowhere. Good infrastructure serving real needs is not only conducive to jobs in the short run but to growth in the long run. Projects should be specifically identified, with budgets and calen- dars and with responsible parties named. 5. How should the U.S. legal and regulatory systems be reformed to incentivize investment and job creation? There are many reasons to be proud of our system of government. The U.S. Constitution is the bedrock of the greatest democracy in the world. The checks and balances put in place by the framers are still powerful limits on each branch’s powers. And this year, we witnessed one of the hallmarks of our great nation – the peaceful transition of power following a democratic election. Our legal system, including our nation’s commitment to the rule of law, has long been a particular source of strength for our economy. When people, communities and companies are confident in the stability and fairness of a country’s legal system, they want to do business in that country and invest there (and come from overseas to do so). Knowing that you will have access to courts for a fair and timely hearing on matters and that there are checks against abuses of power is important. As the discussion about areas for potential reform continues, it is critical that these long-term U.S. advantages are kept in mind and preserved. In regulation, for example, I worry that the distribution of power has shifted. Congress, through the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), set out how regulators should publish draft rules. The APA allows for comments on draft rules, including comments on how a proposed rule will impact lending, jobs and the economy. Today, however, agencies often regulate through supervisory guidance that isn’t subject to the same commentary or checks. The function of interpretive guid- ance is to clarify or explain existing law and should not be used to impose new, substan- tive requirements. Now is a good time to discuss how to reset this balance. There also is an opportunity to have a similar conversation around enforcement and litiga- tion. On the civil side, we should look closely at whether statutory damages provisions work as intended. I read recently about a settlement under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act in which plaintiffs received in excess of $30 million from a business that printed credit card receipts with the customer’s card expiration date. Is that fair and proportionate – or is the result driven by a statutory damages framework that should be reconsidered? And simply because the company agreed to the settlement does not mean it was the right result. Here is the fact: The current dynamics make it very hard for companies to get their day in court – as the consequences of a loss at trial can be disproportionately severe. This is particularly true in a government-initiated case. The collateral consequences of standing up to a regulator or losing at trial can be disproportionately negative when compared with the underlying issue or proposed settle- ment, and it can lead to the decision not to fight at all, no matter what the merits of the case may be. The Institute for Legal Reform, for the Chamber of Commerce has framed this issue as follows: 4242 III. PUBLIC POLICY “The so-called ‘trial penalty’ has virtually annihilated the constitutional right to a trial. What are the consequences of a system in which the government is only rarely required to prove its case? What are the implications of this on businesses, both large and small? Ultimately, what are the long-term prospects for entrepreneurship in an environment where even the most minor, unintentional misstep may result in criminal investigation, prosecution and loss of liberty?” When you combine this with the fact that businesses have no “penalty-free” way to challenge a new interpretation of the law, the net-net result is a system that fosters legislation by enforcement actions and settlements. Said differently, rather than Congress expanding a law or a court testing a novel interpretation, regulators and prosecutors make those deci- sions and companies acquiesce. The impact of these issues is further exacer- bated by a system that allows for “multiple jeopardy,” where federal, state, prudential and foreign agencies can “pile on” to any matter, each seeking its own penalty without any mechanism to ensure that the multiple punishments are proportionate and fair. It would be like getting pulled over by a local police officer and getting fined by your local town, then by your county, then by your state, then by the federal government and then having the U.N. weigh in since the car was made overseas. To be clear, we need regulators focused on the safety and soundness of all institutions. We need enforcement bodies focused on compliance with the law. But we also need to preserve the system of checks and balances – when you cannot get your day in court on some really important issues, we all suffer. We need to improve and reform our legal system because it is having a chilling impact on business formation, risk taking and entrepreneurship. 6. What price are we paying for the lack of understanding about business and free enterprise? The United States needs to ensure that we maintain a healthy and vibrant economy. This is what fuels job creation, raises the standard of living for those who are hurting, and positions us to invest in education, technology and infrastructure in a program- matic and sustainable way to build a better and safer future for our country and its people. America’s military will be the best in the world only as long as we have the best economy in the world. Business plays a critical role as an engine of economic growth, particularly our largest, globally competitive American businesses. As an example, the thousand largest compa- nies in America (out of approximately 29 million) employ nearly 30 million people in the United States, and almost all of their employees get full medical and retirement benefits and extensive training. In addition, these companies account for more than 30% of the roughly $2.3 trillion spent annually on capital expenditures. Capital expendi- tures and R&D spending drive productivity and innovation, which ultimately drive job creation across the entire economy. To support this, we need a pro-growth policy environment from the government that provides a degree of certainty around long- standing issues that have proved frustrat- ingly elusive to solve. The most pressing areas in which government, business and other stakeholders can find common ground should include tax reform, infrastructure investment, education reform, more favor- able trade agreements and a sensible immi- gration policy, among others. When you read that small businesses and big businesses are pitted against each other or are not good for each other, don’t believe it. 4343 Why are America’s public equity markets so important? How do we sustain them and strengthen corporate governance? For more than two centuries, the American free enterprise system has led to enormous prosperity for our country: the creation of jobs, increases in wages and savings, and the emergence and growth of dynamic companies. Because well- managed and well-governed businesses are the engines of our economy, good corporate governance must be more than just a catchphrase or fad. It’s an imperative — especially when it comes to our publicly owned companies. The chart on the right should be a cause for concern. It notes that the number of public companies in the United States has declined 45% since 1996. There may very well be some logical and good explanations for why this is so; e.g., companies can get capital more easily in the private markets, and the private markets can be more efficient than they used to be. I suspect there are other less-constructive reasons, which could be greatly expanded upon, but I will merely list them below: • Excessive litigation, including shareholder class action lawsuits • Excessive and expensive reporting requirements • Self-serving shareholder activity and proposals not intended to benefit the company • Shareholder meetings that are hijacked by special interest groups and become a complete farce • Too much short-termism; i.e., quarterly earnings, at the expense of making good, long-term investments • Constant and frequent negative media scrutiny — some deserved and some not • Boards spending more and more time on check-the-box legal and regulatory demands as opposed to the most important role of boards — management, strategy, major risks, etc. Many private equity companies often stress that it is better to be owned by them because they operate with commonsense corporate governance; i.e., less check-the-box corporate governance — whether addressing board membership, how a board spends its time, management compensation or long-term results vs. just quarterly earnings. The following page exhibits a letter drafted by a diverse group of financial leaders that outlines recommendations for commonsense corporate governance principles that would foster the health of our public companies. It is hard to estimate the cause and effect of all these factors, but they are reasons for concern. America’s public markets have been a key to America’s success, and I suspect that years from now, we may regret the damage we have done to them. 43 Public Companies Disappearing Source: World Bank; World Federation of Exchanges database 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 20152010200520001995199019851980 1996: 8,090 45% decline 2015: 4,381 The health of America’s public corporations and financial markets — and public trust in both — is critical to economic growth and a better financial future for American workers, retirees and investors. Millions of American families depend on these companies for work — our nearly 5,000 public companies account for a third of the nation’s private sector jobs. And these same families and millions more also rely on public companies to help improve their financial future — they are heavily invested in these companies through mutual funds, 401(k) and pension plans, college savings plans and other accounts to buy a home, send their children to college and save for retirement. Our future depends on these companies being managed effectively for long-term prosperity, which is why the governance of American companies is so important to every American. Corporate governance in recent years has often been an area of intense debate among investors, corporate leaders and other stakeholders. Yet, too often, that debate has generated more heat than light. We represent some of America’s largest corporations, as well as investment managers, that, as fiduciaries, represent millions of individual savers and pension beneficiaries. We include corporate CEOs, the head of the Canadian public pension fund and an activist investor, and the heads of a number of institutional investors who manage money on behalf of a broad range of Americans. This diverse group certainly holds varied opinions on corporate governance. But we share the view that constructive dialogue requires find- ing common ground — a starting point to foster the economic growth that benefits shareholders, employees and the economy as a whole. To that end, we have worked to find commonsense principles. We offer these principles, which can be found at www.governanceprinciples. org, in the hope that they will promote further conversation on corporate governance. These principles include the following, among others: ■ Truly independent corporate boards are vital to effective governance, so no board should be beholden to the CEO or management. Every board should meet regularly without the CEO present, and every board should have active and direct engagement with executives below the CEO level; ■ Diverse boards make better decisions, so every board should have members with complementary and diverse skills, backgrounds and experi- ences. It’s also important to balance wisdom and judgment that accompany experience and tenure with the need for fresh thinking and perspectives of new board members; ■ Every board needs a strong leader who is independent of management. The board’s independent directors usually are in the best posi- tion to evaluate whether the roles of chairman and CEO should be separate or combined; and if the board decides on a combined role, it is essential that the board have a strong lead independent director with clearly defined authorities and responsibilities; ■ Our financial markets have become too obsessed with quarterly earnings forecasts. Companies should not feel obligated to provide earnings guidance — and should do so only if they believe that providing such guidance is beneficial to shareholders; ■ A common accounting standard is critical for corporate transparency, so while companies may use non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to explain and clarify their results, they never should do so in such a way as to obscure GAAP-reported results; and in particular, since stock- or options-based compensation is plainly a cost of doing business, it always should be reflected in non-GAAP measurements of earnings; and ■ Effective governance requires constructive engagement between a company and its shareholders. So the company’s institutional investors making decisions on proxy issues important to long-term value creation should have access to the company, its management and, in some circumstances, the board; similarly, a company, its management and board should have access to institutional investors’ ultimate decision makers on those issues. These recommendations are not meant to be absolute. We know that there is significant variation among our public companies and that their approach to corporate governance will inevitably (and appropriately) reflect those differences. But we do hope our effort will be the beginning of a continuing dialogue that will benefit millions of Americans by promoting trust in our nation’s public companies. We encourage others to join in that dialogue. Our country, our economy and the future of our citizens depend on getting corporate governance right.

PUBLIC POLICY Small businesses and large businesses are symbiotic – they are substantial customers of each other, and they help drive each other’s growth – and are integral to our large busi- ness ecosystem. At JPMorgan Chase, for example, we support more than 4 million small business clients, 15,000 middle market companies, and approximately 7,000 corpo- rations and investor clients. We also rely on services from nearly 30,000 vendors, many of which are small and midsized companies. Business, taken as a whole, is the source of almost all job creation. Approximately 150 million people work in the United States; 130 million work in private enterprise. We hold in high regard the 20 million people who work in govern- ment – teachers, policemen, firemen and others. But we could not pay for those jobs if the other 130 million were not actively producing the GDP of America. Something has gone awry in the public’s understanding of business and free enter- prise. Whether it is the current environ- ment or the deficiency of education in general, the lack of understanding around free enterprise is astounding. When busi- nesses or individuals in business do some- thing wrong (problems that all institutions have, including schools, churches, govern- ments, small businesses, etc.), they should be appropriately punished – but not demon- ized. We need trust and confidence in our institutions – confidence is the “secret sauce” that, without spending any money, helps the economy grow. A strong and vibrant private sector (including big companies) is good for the average American. Entrepreneurship and free enterprise, with strong ethics and high standards, are worth rooting for, not attacking. 7. Strong collaboration is needed between business and government. We all can agree that a general dissatisfaction with the lack of true collaboration and will- ingness to address our most pressing policy issues has contributed to the existing divisive and polarized environment. Certainly there is plenty of blame to go around on this front. However, rather than looking back, it is now more important than ever for the busi- ness community and government to come together and collaborate to find meaningful solutions and develop thoughtful policies that create economic growth and opportunity for all. This cannot be done by government alone or by business alone. We all must work together in ways that put aside our “business- as-usual” approaches. The lack of economic opportunity is a moral and economic crisis that affects everyone. There are too many people who are not getting a fair chance to get ahead and move up the economic ladder. This runs contrary to the fundamental idea that America is a country where everyone has an opportunity to improve their lives and that future generations of Americans know they can be just as successful as those who came before them. By working together and applying some good old American can-do ingenuity, there is nothing that we can’t accomplish. By working together, the business community, govern- ment and the nonprofit sector can ensure and maintain a healthy and vibrant economy today and into the future, creating jobs, fostering economic mobility and maintaining sustainable economic growth. Ultimately, this translates to an improved quality of life and greater financial security for those who are struggling to make ends meet. It also would be a significant step in restoring public faith in two of our greatest democratic institutions – U.S. business and government – and would allow us to move forward toward a pros- perous future for all Americans. 46 46 IN CL OSING We know we have to earn the trust and respect of our shareholders, employees, customers and the communities we serve every single day. You can rest assured that we are devoted to doing this. I want to thank our management team. If you could see them in action like I do, you would know that they have remarkable capa- bilities, character, culture, experience and wisdom. In closing, I can’t emphasize enough how honored I am to work at this company and with its people. What they have accomplished during these turbulent times has been extraordinary. On behalf of JPMorgan Chase and its management, I want to express my deepest gratitude to our people – I am proud to be their partner. Jamie Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer April 4, 2017 47 Technology continues to fuel everything we do Technology is at the core of what we do. Advances in technology make us faster and safer and drive a more engaging customer experience, differ- entiating our businesses today and for the future. The pace of technology change is always increasing, and we challenge ourselves to think, innovate and deliver like a technology company. Our more than $9.5 billion technol- ogy budget demonstrates our signif- icant, ongoing commitment to tech- nology investment. The scale and diversity of our businesses enable us to invest wherever we see oppor - tunity or competitive advantage to do so effectively. We will continue to grow the share of our technology budget allocated to new investment and innovation by optimizing our existing technology environment. We will also maintain a relentless focus and significant spend on cybersecurity, protecting the firm and enabling the secure introduc- tion of new capabilities. Optimize to innovate 2016 was a year of mobilizing a port- folio of optimization programs that increased the pace and quality of tech- nology delivery while decreasing cost. Improving software development productivity and adopting cloud infra- structure are core elements of that strategy. We continued to improve developer productivity by enabling an agile technology workforce and auto- mating the software development life cycle. We are also defining design standards to provide a common tech- nical framework for development of applications of a particular type, for example, big data analytics. This will significantly reduce rework and dupli- cation in the software development life cycle where, previously, applica- tion developers have had to create their own one-off frameworks. We anticipate that these steps ultimately will lead to a 20% efficiency gain in the development process. Historically, we have followed a traditional “waterfall” approach to software development, with separate teams and processes for development, testing and operations. The agile approach, by contrast, is characterized by multifunctional and collaborative teams and allows frequent readjust- ment to project plans in response to changing requirements. Adopting this approach vastly improves software quality through its iterative nature and accelerates our ability to deliver incremental value. To put that into perspective, we are moving from soft- ware release cycles measured in quar- ters to cycles measured in days. We have also made great progress toward fully automating develop- ment life cycle processes and stan- dardizing developer toolkits. In 2016, automated code scanning and deployment tools resulted in savings of nearly 120,000 developer hours – As the firm’s Chief Operating Officer, I manage a diverse group of critical firmwide operations and functions, as well as certain markets-intensive activities that are integral to our success. These include Global Technology, the Intelligent Solutions group (which drives innovation across the firm by leveraging big data and advanced analytics such as machine learning), Treasury and the Chief Investment Office, Mortgage Banking Capital Markets, Oversight & Control, Regulatory Affairs and the Chief Administrative Office, which includes Real Estate, Procurement, Military & Veteran Affairs, Compli- ance Operations and Strategy & Process Improvement, among others. The Chief Operating Office (COO) has a broad and deep mandate, but this year, I want to highlight (i) our invest- ment in technology; (ii) our approach to managing a $2.5 trillion balance sheet; and (iii) our ongoing commit- ment to a best-in-class culture.

Working collab- oratively with public cloud providers, we have made significant progress developing a set of solutions that meets our rigorous risk and security standards. The public cloud reduces our peak infrastructure requirements by providing compute services during temporary fluctuations in demand. The public cloud also helps reduce long-term storage costs and accelerates developer access to new cloud services. In 2016, we invested in a new global data center strategy to consolidate our existing facilities into fewer, larger, more modular sites. In early 2017, we opened our first new state-of-the-art data center, which is the strategic model for all future builds globally. The new data centers will house our next-generation optimized infrastruc- ture, enabling significant cost benefits. For example, hardware commoditiza- tion already has reduced our server costs by 25%. We also have intro- duced innovative storage offerings, decreasing the price of our lowest tier storage by 75%. We are driving addi- tional efficiency by reducing waste and becoming smarter around tech- nology consumption – for example, reducing over-provisioned storage and automating manual operational tasks. Our applications are also changing. We are designing and developing applications to take full advantage of the cloud’s benefits. In addition, there is growing internal and external demand for simple, self-service inter- faces to our data and applications. To meet this demand, we are leveraging application programming interfaces (API) and launched an internal API store to provide access to a market- place of secure application services to developers throughout the firm. The old world of developing and writing and, over the next few years, we expect to be able to deliver more than 90% of our software through end-to-end automation. Attracting, retaining and developing top technology talent is paramount, and we cast a net far and wide to find the best and the brightest. In 2016, 32% of our senior hires in technology came from non-financial services firms. We had a 10:1 applicant-to- position ratio for our Technology Ana- lyst Program, which targets graduates of global universities that have strong technology programs. Our employee training programs cover new skill sets, such as cloud and agile development. We also reinforce a strong innovation culture and atmosphere to spark new solutions through open source proj- ects and “hackathons” in which tech- nologists collaboratively code to solve business problems. In 2016, we hosted a firmwide global hackathon across 20 cities with over 2,500 developer partic- ipants. This led to 400 new product ideas, of which 130 were potential opportunities for patents. We continued to pursue a hybrid cloud strategy – leveraging a next- generation internal, private cloud, as well as external, public cloud services – to further enable our developers through on-demand availability, pay- for-use and elastic scalability. In 2016, we launched a new private cloud plat- form called Gaia, designed to provide developers with rapid agility – so that they spend more time developing and less time provisioning infrastructure and application services. Over 5,000 developers already have begun to use Gaia. By the end of 2017, we expect to more than double the number of applications hosted on the platform. Over the last year, we established a new Cloud Services function within Global Technology to accelerate our unique code is rapidly being replaced by reusable component pieces (“microservices”) that can communi- cate seamlessly, dramatically reducing integration development time and driving developer efficiency. We also are expanding the APIs we offer exter- nally to enable direct client integration and secure solutions by third-party developers – for example, the partner- ship with Intuit that we recently announced. By the end of 2017, we estimate our applications will generate more than 100 million internal and external API calls each day. Advancing innovation and partnerships As a firm, innovation is our top stra- tegic priority. We take pride in our ability to differentiate ourselves through the development of new solutions and the adoption of emerg- ing technology at scale. Demand for digital-centric experiences is transforming our businesses faster than ever. Most of our digital solutions will continue to be built in-house due to competitive and strategic impor- tance. However, we have realized the complementary benefit of partnering with fintech companies to enhance select digital products and services. As a result, our strategy is a combination of build, buy and partner in order to continue delivering the best digital products and services at scale. We have formalized a firmwide fin- tech strategy and ecosystem engage- ment model to identify and leverage partner relationships across all of our business areas. In their letters, each of our CEOs highlights exam- ples of how technological innovation is delivering value to their business. Our relationships with the external technology ecosystem helped drive value across our technology focus areas, including next-generation data 49 administration, for which we expect to automate 1.7 million requests in 2017. We have line of sight into more than $30 million run rate saves from robotic process automation in 2017, a savings that, coupled with other optimization efforts, will continue to increase substantially in the years to come. This technology has the oppor- tunity to deliver immediate benefit in several areas across the firm, helping us to position our workforce around higher value tasks and functions. Machine learning Machine learning offers another excit- ing opportunity to drive new capabili- ties for the firm and our customers and clients. Machine learning technol- ogy provides insights about data without needing to pre-program algo- rithms. Machine learning technology actively learns from data with the goal of predicting outcomes. The more these learning algorithms are engaged, the more effective they become at identifying patterns and relationships. In 2016, we established a center of excellence within Intelligent Solutions to explore and implement a growing number of use cases for machine learning applications across the firm. As an example, we recently intro- duced COiN, a contract intelligence platform that uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze legal doc- uments and to extract important data points and clauses. In an initial imple- mentation of this technology, we can extract 150 relevant attributes from 12,000 annual commercial credit agreements in seconds compared with as many as 360,000 hours per year under manual review. This capa- bility has far-reaching implications considering that approximately 80% of loan servicing errors today are due to contract interpretation errors. We also use machine learning to drive predictive recommendations and analytics platforms, such as Hadoop and Spark. To maximize the impact of these new data platforms, we have doubled our big data infra- structure consistently year-over-year. We now can access and analyze data in ways that we could not have done before. For example, last year, we re-engineered our Market Risk plat- form, one of the largest in-memory risk analytics platforms in the world. The platform now manages over 1 billion risk sensitivities and pro- vides visibility 17 times faster than the prior system while delivering a more granular and holistic view of the firm’s risk exposure. Within our global payments strategy, we have developed a new payments platform based on similar cutting- edge technologies. It will replace nine monolithic platforms and enhance client value through real-time cross- border payment execution and end- to-end payment status transparency. In addition, the platform will enable us to bring new products to market more quickly and offer a more config- urable, flexible client experience through reusable APIs and microser- vices for event processing. As we look forward, two emerging areas of innovation – robotics and machine learning – offer promising opportunities to drive new value through automation and insight. Robotics Robotic process automation is soft- ware that automates routine, repeti- tive activity that otherwise would be performed manually. Virtual “bots” are available 24/7 to efficiently exe- cute simple processes without the risk of human error. In 2016, we estab- lished an internal center of excellence to drive best practices around a grow- ing pipeline of robotic process auto- mation, including systems access for Investment Banking. Last year, we introduced the Emerging Oppor- tunities Engine, which helps identify clients best positioned for follow-on equity offerings through automated analysis of current financial positions, market conditions and historical data. Given the initial success of the Emerging Opportunities Engine in Equity Capital Markets, we are expanding it to other areas, like Debt Capital Markets, similarly basing predictions on client financial data, issuance history and market activity. We are initiating pilots for a broad range of machine learning use cases – from detecting anomalies for fraud and cybersecurity, to generating targeted trading strategies to share with clients, to optimizing our client- servicing channels. We are only at the very beginning of tapping the poten- tial capabilities of machine learning and its benefits to our business. We also are excited about the pros- pects of cognitive automation, which combines both robotics and machine learning technologies to mimic human judgment. Cognitive automa- tion has the potential to automate more complex, human-like processes, such as perceiving, hypothesizing and reasoning. In 2016, we successfully piloted a virtual assistant technology to respond to employee technology service desk requests through a natu- ral language interface. We are rolling out this technology in 2017 to help us initially triage over 120,000 service tickets, with plans to expand the capa- bility to address even more of the 1.7 million annual employee requests. Securing a changing landscape Our cybersecurity strategy is focused on securely enabling new technology and business initiatives while main- taining a relentless focus on protect- ing the firm from cybersecurity 50 embrace our cybersecurity leadership responsibility to the industry. In 2016, we led the creation of the Financial Systemic Analysis & Resil- ience Center (FSARC) in partnership with seven of our peer banks and the U.S. government. FSARC’s mission is to proactively identify, analyze, assess and coordinate activities to mitigate systemic risk to the U.S. financial system from cybersecurity threats through focused operations and enhanced collaboration. Increasingly, our customers and clients view our cyber posture, like our fortress balance sheet, as a source of strength. We will continue to work tirelessly to identify oppor- tunities in which the firm can lever- age our cybersecurity expertise to strengthen our controls, protect our client relationships and improve the posture of the broader industry. Liquidity and interest rate risk The firm’s Treasury and Chief Invest- ment Office are integral to delivering on our strategic objectives, playing a primary role in overseeing our $2.5 trillion balance sheet and providing both governance and risk manage- ment expertise around interest rate and liquidity risk. We meet our objectives through our nearly $300 billion high-quality investment secu- rities portfolio, as well as the $300+ billion of funding and liquidity sources directed by Treasury. Most notable in 2016 was our work related to liquidity and funding in response to U.S. regulator feedback on our 2015 Resolution Plan. We intro- duced a comprehensive new liquidity framework to estimate available resources and liquidity needs during a resolution event – and, as part of this work, rolled out two enhanced liquid- ity models across our material legal entities. We further strengthened the threats. Our defensive philosophy fol- lows a “kill chain” approach – layers of controls aligned to the multiple stages of the cyber threat life cycle (from early warning, to inbound/ outbound prevention and detection, to response and recovery). We have aligned our security technology and processes to this life cycle, with a focus on a “shift left” approach – increasing our effectiveness in detect- ing and preventing malicious activity at the earliest points in the life cycle. The firm continues to make signifi- cant investments in cybersecurity to enhance these defensive controls and our resilience to threats. For exam- ple, we have deployed web browser isolation technology to reduce the risk of employee compromise through phishing. Investments in security analytics, data science and automation technology will enable analysts within our Security Opera- tions Centers to efficiently detect and respond to anomalous activity. We have adopted and continue to evolve leading-edge technology to prevent client fraud across lines of business, including risk-decisioning engines that help distinguish between good and bad activity in real time. Through robust employee awareness and readiness programs, we continue to reinforce the idea that cybersecu- rity is everyone’s job. We also edu- cate our customers and clients on how to protect their assets and business from cyber threats. We broadly distribute awareness com- munications and conduct both in- person and web-based training in which more than 7,000 clients in Asset & Wealth Management, more than 3,000 Commercial Banking clients and over 1,900 Corporate & Investment Bank clients participated in 2016 alone. As one of the largest global financial institutions, we firm’s liquidity position, raising more than $50 billion of liquidity to meet the requirements of the new frame- work. While deposit growth in excess of loan growth drove some of this improvement, the liquidity benefit came mainly from a reduction in non- high quality liquid assets in our invest- ment securities portfolio and an increase in Treasury-originated short- and long-term secured funding. Our focus on optimizing the firm’s balance sheet continued with rigor through 2016. We extended our opti- mization framework to analyze the maturity structure of our long-term debt, and we introduced the indus- try’s first total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) efficient callable debt struc- ture, resulting in a larger proportion of our outstanding long-term debt being TLAC eligible. More broadly, our optimization framework helped to inform our new multi-factor equity allocation approach to better align incentives with the broader set of constraints we face. Our firmwide Asset Strategy group together with our Deposit Strategy group provide strategic cross-business focus on our deposit, lending and investment activities. These forums have and will continue to evolve our analytical frameworks and monitoring capabili- ties, as well as continually assess market opportunities and associated resources and risks. 2016 also saw a move higher in U.S. dollar interest rates and featured a sec- ond rate hike by the Fed in December. During the second half of 2016, three- month LIBOR increased 35 basis points to 1%, while 10-year Treasury yields increased nearly 100 basis points to 2.43%. Staying true to our disciplined risk management frame- work, we opportunistically added duration through our investment secu- rities portfolio as long-end rates rose. 51 Matt Zames Chief Operating Officer Market expectations have shifted as well. At the end of the second quar- ter of 2016, the market was expecting the Fed’s interest rate on reserves to remain below 1% through the end of 2019. With recent and anticipated Fed interest rate hikes, industry expectations are now for the rate on reserves to reach 2% during 2019. And, as indicated by our $2.4 billion of “earnings-at-risk,” our firm bene- fits greatly when rates rise, particu- larly short rates, which allow us to capture the full value of our signifi- cant deposit franchise. We continue to build on the great work started in 2015 on our intraday liquidity program, with technology at the core of our advancements. We are able to monitor, in real time, the liquidity impact of over $6 trillion of transactions daily and the credit expo- sure across tens of thousands of intra- day credit facilities, consuming up to 5,500 updates per second. This year, we introduced big data analytics, which has substantially improved our predictive capabilities around intra- day drivers. We store 90 million data points covering in excess of 18 months of daily history, adding over 500,000 data points per day. We are now realizing the benefits of harness- ing this vast amount of data, inform- ing decisions internally and improv- ing the quality of our dialogue with clients. Additionally, we are leverag- ing technology to further optimize approximately $1 trillion of collateral the firm has received, as well as the firm’s own collateral, to provide a more integrated and dynamic operat- ing model for collateral firmwide. A culture of accountability Having fortress controls remains a critical priority, but controls alone are not sufficient without the right culture. The COO will continue its leadership to reinforce our Business Principles and cultural values throughout the firm and maintain an appropriate governance framework to effectively manage our approach to conduct risk. Confirming we are get- ting it right requires a comprehensive set of metrics, and, over the past year, we have introduced a series of con- duct measures to do just that. Culture and Conduct Risk was reaf- firmed as a strategic priority at our Operating Committee annual strategy off-site meeting in July. We recently appointed a Chief Culture and Con- duct Officer for the firm to reinforce ownership of conduct risk and a con- sistent firmwide approach in the first line of defense. We also established a separate risk stripe for Conduct Risk so that we have disciplined and con- sistent oversight and a clear conduct risk management framework. We use increasingly sophisticated detective controls to help us identify broad, as well as individual, trends in employee conduct. For example, we now have in production a Front Office Supervisory monthly report across our markets businesses globally. This tool consolidates key sales and trad- ing metrics, such as number of can- celed and amended trades and credit and market risk limit breaches, with compliance metrics, such as an employee’s compliance with manda- tory training and consecutive leave requirements, to give supervisors a view of their employees’ behavior. We also surveil certain electronic commu- nications and trades to identify poten- tial misconduct, and we have imple- mented controls designed to prevent and detect abuses related to collusion, market misconduct or manipulation and corruption, among others. We continue to develop our Culture and Conduct Risk Dashboard, which is reviewed with our Board of Direc- tors and senior management. The Dashboard is a qualitative and quan- titative assessment that includes key metrics and commentary related to how well-controlled we are and how well we manage risk, compliance results for our businesses and employees, Code of Conduct matters, employee survey results, and cus- tomer and client feedback/com- plaints for each of our businesses. In 2017, we will continue to connect key programs, metrics and policies across the firm to identify additional opportunities – and our Board of Directors will continue to hold us accountable for this important work. Our approach is iterative, driven by our commitment to our firmwide values and ongoing communication of our standards to our employees. We engage in ongoing dialogue with our regulators, industry peers and other experts to identify and adopt best practices. Looking ahead I have never been more excited about the opportunities ahead. Our focus on innovation and aggressive optimization to meet new challenges will continue to result in dynamic changes to our operating model as we best position our businesses for the future. In so doing, we will main- tain a relentless commitment to the highest standards of conduct and safety and soundness to protect the integrity and security of the markets in which we operate and the assets of our customers and clients. 52 • Protect the firm and its clients/ customers, investors and employ- ees from cyberattacks, as well as protect the privacy of their data and transactions • Continue our unwavering commit- ment to build and maintain an effective and efficient control environment • Execute structural expense manage- ment strategies while continuing to invest for the future • Attract, train, develop and retain the best talent and strengthen our diversity Simply put, our commitment to cus- tomers is at the heart of everything we do. It’s what drives our work and our strong results. We know that happy customers will do more busi- ness with us and stick with us throughout their lives. For us, our goal is not only to acquire customers – it’s to acquire customers who view Chase as their primary bank or credit card. We want to be our customers’ first call when they are seeking financial advice. Today, we have a relationship with almost half of all households in the U.S. We grew our customer base in 2016 by 4% to 60 million U.S. house- holds. We are the primary bank for more than 70% of our consumer households and nearly 50% of our small businesses. Our household attrition is at record lows. And according to our 2016 Brand Health Survey, the Chase brand is at the strongest levels we have seen, rank- ing #1 in key categories, including consideration, which measures if survey participants would consider doing business with Chase and have a positive perception of Chase. While we are extremely pleased with where we are, we know we have plenty of work to do. There is tre- mendous opportunity literally on our own doorstep. More than 80% of Chase households with a mortgage got it somewhere else. Only one-third of our customers are engaged with more than one product across Chase. And only 10% of our small business customers who have a Chase banker use us for business banking, credit card and merchant services, while 43% of small businesses need all three. We can continue to grow sim- ply by serving our existing customers exceptionally well and earning their trust to do more business with us. Building a strong business for the future We have been fortunate to be in an extended, historically benign credit environment. Despite that, we have not forgotten the painful lessons of 2008 and have maintained an extremely disciplined approach to credit throughout the cycle. In Mortgage Banking, we’ve increased our loan balances while improving the quality of our servic- ing portfolio. Today, our delinquency rate is approaching its lowest level in Consumer & Community Banking 2016 financial results 2016 was another strong year for Consumer & Community Banking (CCB). All our businesses performed well and delivered very strong results. We gained market share in each of our six business units. For the full year, we achieved a return on equity of 18% on net income of $9.7 billion and revenue of $44.9 billion. We made meaningful progress on our 2016 priorities – a strategy we have been following consistently since we unified our Consumer busi- nesses in 2012 under CCB: • Deepen relationships with our customers and simplify and improve the customer experience • Lead payments innovation by delivering solutions that address merchant and consumer needs • Increase digital engagement by delivering differentiated experiences Gordon Smith 53 a decade, and our foreclosure inven- tory is down 85% since 2012. That’s important because a nonperforming loan is 25 to 30 times more expen- sive for us to service than one that is performing. We are continuing to evolve Mortgage Banking into a less volatile and more profitable busi- ness. In our Card business, we have been very consistent in terms of our modest exposure to the less than 660 FICO segment. And when you look at the mid-prime space, characterized as FICO scores between 640 and 720, we have the lowest share among the players in the industry. Our credit card losses remain at very low levels. Along with credit discipline, we remain fiercely devoted to expense discipline. We reversed a trend of ris- ing expenses with relatively flat rev- enue. Since 2014, we achieved $2.4 billion in structural expense reduc- tions and improved our overhead ratio from 58% in 2014 to 55% in 2016. Importantly, during that same time period, we continued to pru- dently invest in our core businesses to deliver value for the long term. In particular, we’ve invested heavily in technology and marketing associated with new product launches, digital and payments innovation, and cyber- security. Our investments have also improved our control environment, leading to more automated processes and better customer and employee experiences. Expense discipline is part of how we do business every day, and the work to reduce our structural expenses will continue. Payments innovation Payments are at the very core of what our business does for customers. We are one of the few companies that can deliver the full payment chain from merchant to consumer. The payments industry is one that is evolving rapidly with innovation and new entrants. Our strategy has been consistent: • Build our own proprietary wallet with Chase Pay SM • Be top of wallet in other wallets, whether that is Apple PayTM, Android PayTM, Samsung PayTM, or other embedded payment systems such as Amazon or Uber • Have the best person-to-person (P2P) payments experience anywhere • Create card products that our customers love, with rich reward offerings to make them top of the physical and digital wallet The future here is still unknown as customers adopt new capabilities. But we know payments are core to what we do, and we are investing across multiple fronts to create the best pay- ments experience for our consumer and merchant customers as technol- ogy evolves. In 2016, we achieved some key milestones in payments: Commerce Solutions – Our Chase Commerce Solutions business has earned double-digit growth since 2012 and in 2016 surpassed a stagger- ing $1 trillion in processing volume. Chase Pay – We introduced Chase Pay, our payment solution that pro- vides benefits to both customers and merchants. Chase Pay has unique fea- tures other payment methods don’t and has the Chase brand and security behind it.

Since we are more than a credit card company and given our new customers’ strong sat- isfaction and engagement with their Sapphire Reserve cards, we are confi- dent they will also choose Chase to do more of their banking, invest- ments and loans. New card launches – While receiv- ing less hype than Sapphire Reserve, we’ve also introduced several other popular cards. Chase Freedom Unlimited SM simplified our cash-back proposition by offering customers 1.5% cash back on everything they buy. And not to be outdone, Ink Business Preferred SM and our Amazon PrimeSM card also earned a very strong customer reception. Together, these cards have contributed to our momentum. In 2016, we saw new accounts up 20%, card sales volume up 10% and outstandings up 8%. Digital We think we can confidently say that Chase is the digital leader in the industry. We have the #1 rated mobile banking app, #1 ATM network and #1 most visited banking portal in the U.S. This is important because, increasingly, digital is a critical driver in why customers choose to do busi- ness with Chase. Banking no longer is a sometimes activity – customers engage with us every day. More than 26 million customers are active on our mobile app today. Digital also drives tremendous loyalty. House- holds that use our digital channels have credit and debit spend levels over 90% higher than those that don’t. Customers who are digitally engaged have higher satisfaction and retention rates, spend more and have far lower transaction costs. Advancing our digital and technol- ogy capabilities is job #1, but we are also paying close attention to the emerging technologies in our indus- try. Many new fintech companies are mastering ways to simplify the cus- tomer experience. Those we meet with have huge respect for the Chase brand, and they envy our scale and distribution. In cases where we think their solutions will improve the cus- tomer experience quickly, we partner with them. A few of those 2016 part- nerships have worked out very well: • Chase Business Quick Capital ® – A partnership with OnDeck to pro- vide fast funding to small businesses using Chase underwriting standards • Chase Digital Mortgage SM – A partnership with Roostify that helps our customers manage the mortgage process online or on mobile • Chase Auto Direct SM – A partner- ship with TrueCar that allows cus- tomers to shop for and finance the specific car they want online and simply pick it up at the dealership We continue to study and meet with new players to evaluate which part- nerships could benefit our customers. Chase in the community Chase’s 5,258 branches are the face of our firm to local communities. Roughly two-thirds of our custom- ers visit a Chase branch four times a quarter on average. Our branches are located in the fastest growing markets in the country, and we are outpacing our competitors wherever we compete. If you visit our branches regularly, you will see how they have changed. There are fewer teller lines and more including WalMart, Starbucks and Best Buy, have partnered with us to offer Chase Pay to their customers. It’s early, but we’re already seeing promis- ing results and expect 2017 to show continued strong momentum. Person-to-person payments – Chase QuickPay SM has been an industry leader with 94 million transactions in 2016. The number of households using QuickPay has gone up 30% in just the past year. As strong as it is, we took an important step to make it even better. We worked with 20+ other financial institutions on a solu- tion called Zelle that speeds up P2P real-time payments between banks. Sapphire Reserve SM – This past year, our team noticed an important insight from our customers: People are traveling differently. They want to feel more like locals than tourists, and the shared economy has revolu- tionized the travel industry. When choosing a credit card, customers want a card that rewards them more for doing what they love to do and helps them discover the future of travel. We created Sapphire Reserve with one of the strongest point pro- grams in the industry. And while we knew we had designed a superb card, frankly, even we were surprised by the sensation it became. We exceeded our annual target of cus- tomers in less than two weeks. Sapphire Reserve has introduced Chase to an exciting and passionate customer base with average FICO scores above 785 and an average deposit and investment wallet of over $800,000. Even more exciting, the majority of our new Sapphire Reserve customers are millennials. That is significant because millenni- als make up the majority of our new deposit accounts today, and their 55 • Consumer relationship with almost half of U.S. households • #1 in primary bank relationships within our Chase footprint • Consumer deposit volume has grown at more than twice the industry average since 2012 • #1 most visited banking portal in the U.S. — chase.com • #1 rated mobile banking app • #1 ATM network in the U.S. 2016 HigH ligHTS And A CCoM pliSHMenTS • #1 credit card issuer in the U.S. • #1 U.S. co-brand credit card issuer • #1 in total U.S. credit and debit payments volume • #2 merchant acquirer • #2 mortgage originator and servicer • #3 bank auto lender options for customers who choose to self-serve. There are more private spaces and conference rooms for customers to meet with a banker and privately discuss transactions. And the branches just look better. Most branches are refreshed roughly every six to seven years to update the tech- nology and brand experience. We know one thing that will drive a customer crazy is a long teller line. Since 2014, we’ve reduced total teller transactions by ~130 million and increased self-service/digital transac- tions by ~180 million. That’s great progress, but we still can do more. In 2016, 70% of our 400 million teller transactions could have been per- formed through a self-service chan- nel. We continue to work with our customers to help them understand how to complete transactions on their own if they so choose. And as transaction volumes come down, we will rationalize our branch footprint. We have been opening branches in higher growth areas and consolidating those with less foot traffic. As a result, we reduced our net branches by about 150 in the past year. However, by being smart about where we open branches, even in markets where we consolidated, we still grew share. Our branches also are advice centers for many of our 4 million small busi- nesses. There are few things more gratifying than watching a small business owner turn an idea into a sale and then sales into a business. Since 2012, our share of business cus- tomers who use Chase as their pri- mary bank grew from 6% to 9%. We improved our Net Promoter Score by 38%. And since 2014, average depos- its are up by 21% and loans by 13%. At Chase, we take very seriously the role our business plays in helping customers make the most of their money. Our goal is to offer products, advice and tools to help them make the best choices. It’s such a privilege to be in the business of banking and payments. We are honored to be part of our customers’ lives in a way that few businesses are. On behalf of the more than 130,000 employees in Consumer & Commu- nity Banking, thank you for your investment in us. Gordon Smith CEO, Consumer & Community Banking 2016 West Coast Bus Tour Every summer, we go out on the road to meet with our employees and ask for their feedback. They tell us what they are hearing from our customers and give us ideas on how we can make our Chase customer experience even better. We’ve made many customer improvements as a result of our bus tours, and we have a lot of fun along the way. 56 driving wallet share increases across our already top-ranked businesses. We don’t take our leadership for granted, though. Despite our leading franchises, we continue to look beneath the surface of our businesses, ask the critical questions and make improvements where necessary. We are committed to staying ahead of the curve and embracing the techno- logical changes affecting our industry in the face of competitors, both new and traditional. By investing in scalable platforms and innovative trading tools and improv- ing the overall experience, we are serving clients better, faster and more efficiently than ever before. More important, while we drove annual expenses down to $19 billion by stay- ing disciplined, we still kept investing for the future. The market share gains we experienced in 2016 were sup- ported by the CIB’s profitability and our willingness to make strategic investments in innovation that will bolster our growth for years to come. The past year demonstrated once again that there will always be unpre- dictable global events. One unknown is the ultimate outcome of negotia- tions between the U.K. and the EU. We are fortunate to have options in terms of locations and legal entities that will allow us to serve clients seamlessly during the transition. We will need to make adjustments, but our commitment to clients in the U.K. and the EU is as strong as ever. By continually improving, adapting and being prepared, we are better able to respond. That’s what our clients have come to expect, and we know that their success is the foun- dation for ours. Strengthening investment banking leadership Investment banking has always been about deep, long-standing relation- ships and solutions. Clients want consistent coverage, good ideas and global capabilities. We have an excep- tional Investment Banking franchise that consistently ranks #1 globally. That success continued in 2016 with an 8.1% share of the global fee wallet. We take immense pride in our peo- ple and the talent at J.P. Morgan, and our #1 standing is mainly due to the fact that we have the industry’s best bankers. Still, there are sectors and geographies in which we can always improve. Since 2014, we have hired approximately 60 investment bank- ers, about 40 of whom were manag- ing directors, who brought experi- ence and relationships that will help bring J.P. Morgan’s full suite of solu- tions to even more clients. Our bankers represent a franchise that has a full range of global capa- bilities. Our Debt Capital Markets team retained its hold at the top of the global debt league tables. Its expertise and the firm’s ability to deliver capital in scale for complex financings set us apart. Corporate & Investment Bank During a year of significant volatility, the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) consistently delivered for its clients. Throughout 2016, we increased or maintained our leading positions by avoiding complacency, reinforcing our culture of meeting the highest standards and attracting the best talent in the industry. By adhering to those principles, the CIB achieved impressive results in 2016. Record earnings of $10.8 billion were up 34% compared with 2015, and our $35.2 billion in total revenue reflects a gain of 5% over the previ- ous year. That performance produced a superior return on equity (ROE) of 16% on a capital base of $64 billion. Providing clients with capital and liquidity during volatile market condi- tions has become even more essential in recent years. As some competitors retrenched and signs of decreasing liquidity emerged, we remained supportive and accessible. Our global scale, complete product set and the strength of our balance sheet, under- pinned by our sound risk manage- ment practices, enabled us to con- sistently serve clients, a factor in daniel pinto 57 One standout deal of the year was evi- dent in J.P. Morgan’s role as the lead financial advisor to Dell Inc. and Sil- ver Lake Partners on Dell’s $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corporation, the largest technology transaction in his- tory. In addition, J.P. Morgan served as global financing coordinator on Dell’s $49.5 billion of committed financing associated with this transaction. We also remain a leading source of debt capital for U.S. nonprofit and governmental entities, specifically states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. Last year, J.P. Morgan raised $90 billion of credit and capital for these important clients. In 2016, we also were the top equity underwriter. Despite a difficult envi- ronment for initial public offerings (IPO) and a significantly smaller industry wallet, J.P. Morgan was the only global bank to gain share last year. Our bankers led 343 deals, more than any other bank. J.P. Morgan was a global coordinator and sponsor on the Postal Savings Bank of China’s $7.6 billion IPO, the largest equity deal of the year and the largest IPO since the 2014 deal for Alibaba, in which J.P. Morgan acted as global coordinator. That 2016 deal under- scored once again our ability to exe- cute large transactions around the world by connecting regional issuers with global investors. In order to grow, clients have often searched for merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities to transform their companies. They look to trusted advisors who understand their compa- nies and sectors and can provide the strategic insights to help them expand. Our global team of M&A bankers works together to coordinate quickly and often, enabling J.P. Morgan to identify timely trends and opportuni- ties across industries and borders. After record M&A volume in 2015, overall activity was down in 2016, but J.P. Morgan advised on more deals than any other bank and ranked #2 in wallet share globally. The firm’s North America M&A wallet share grew by 60 basis points since the end of 2015. Having top franchises across M&A, debt and equity gives us real-time, global market insights. Windows of opportunity in both M&A and capital markets can open and close quickly. Having expertise across product areas allows us to be timely and provide our clients with the best solutions to further their growth strategies. That’s how we build trust. Our Investment Banking franchise also enjoys a strong partnership with Commercial Banking (CB) that sets us apart from all other competitors. Its Commercial and Industrial fran- chise is a leading bank to nearly 18,000 clients. As those businesses grow and flourish, many need capi- tal and advisory services from the Corporate & Investment Bank. In 2016, the CIB led more than 800 capital markets transactions for CB clients and generated a record $2.3 billion of gross investment banking revenue. Despite that already impres- sive pipeline of shared client business, we think the potential magnitude over time could reach $3 billion. Another developing partnership for the CIB is the potential to work with J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Manage- ment and its client base of family offices. We think there is more oppor- tunity to offer these large investors participation in CIB transactions relevant to their investment goals. Investments and scale in the global markets We believe that having global scale, a complete platform and operational excellence are essential to having a best-in-class, profitable franchise. In 2016, our Markets business (Fixed Income and Equities) finished the year with a combined $21.0 billion in rev- enue, a year-over-year increase of 15%. We have always believed that provid- ing clients with a global and diverse Markets business leads to a higher and more resilient ROE. In 2016, each one of our major Fixed Income busi- nesses produced a ROE above the cost of capital. More important, the mar- ginal contribution that each business provides to the larger Fixed Income franchise is much greater. The costs to run our Markets business are mostly fixed so operating leverage gives us upside when market growth occurs, which is what we saw last year. Even Commodities, which didn’t meet its cost of capital in 2015, in part because of ongoing simplification efforts, pro- duced a good return in 2016. Since 2010, the Fixed Income indus- try revenue pool has contracted from $157 billion to $114 billion. However, because of our scale, continuous investments and risk discipline, we were able to increase our market share over the seven-year period from 8.6% to 12.0%. Our Equities and Prime Services businesses, major areas of focus for us, also gained share during that seven-year period. Our market share increased from 6.9% to 10.1%, and we are now ranked #2, even as the global wallet declined by $6 billion during that stretch. We had record revenue and balances in prime bro- kerage last year. It’s an area where we committed to invest in order to complete our platform, and the prog- ress is evident across all segments. In fact, since 2014, we have grown synthetic revenue by 48% and cash revenue by 12% within our prime brokerage business, bringing the two segments more into balance. Our 58 leading equity derivatives franchise grew revenue by 26% even while the industry revenue pool shrunk by 5%. We’ve also made great strides in cash equities. No doubt about it, we were late to the game when it came to investing in low-touch, electronic trading about a decade ago. But by taking advantage of our profitability and committing ourselves to signifi- cant, ongoing technology invest- ments, we now are a leading equities franchise and are driving the changes of tomorrow. Between 2014 and 2016, the overall cash equities industry rev- enue pool fell by 18%, yet our revenue decreased by only 4%, helped by a 31% jump in low-touch revenue. The technology investments we made helped preserve our share in a declin- ing market and positioned us for growth as we continue to onboard clients faster and build best-in-class electronic trading tools. We are proud to be a perennial leader in Fixed Income and pleased with the progress we’ve made in Equities, but there is still more to do. Across the Markets businesses, we track 31 sub- product and geographic categories. In 2012, we held a top three leadership position in 61% of those categories. In 2016, we improved our standing by having a top three leadership position in 77% of those same categories. The bulk of those leadership improve- ments came from investments we made in Asia, where we have com- pleted or enhanced some pieces of our global platform. We feel very good about our Markets business. Global scale and a complete platform have never been more critical. We have many competitive advantages in Markets, but it is essential we continue to invest and proactively think about disruption on our own terms. Adapting to the new market structure Technology is rapidly reshaping the Markets landscape, positively alter- ing how our clients trade and how we communicate with them. As the technology advances, we have the resources and the will to embrace behavioral shifts and build offerings around them. We fundamentally believe that clients should have the ability to choose how they want to trade with us rather than be con- strained by the technologies we, or they, happen to have. Our Markets Execution group is dedicated to mak- ing sure clients can seamlessly and confidently engage with us anytime, anywhere, now and in the future. Whether it was the U.K.’s referendum to exit the EU, the results of the U.S. presidential election or the uncer- tainty of China’s growth rate, the CIB’s technology, our scale and opera- tional excellence enabled clients to trade through turbulent markets. In the case of the U.K. referendum, as results were tallied, J.P. Morgan smoothly handled record volume in currency trading, at one point pro- cessing 1,000 tickets per second as investors scrambled and adjusted their positions around the world. While impressive, years of technol- ogy investments and proper risk dis- cipline prepared us for an event such as the U.K. referendum. Our profit- able Markets business, which gener- ated an overall ROE of 17% last year, enables us to invest in innovation and the client experience. Eighty- three percent of notional FX trading is now done electronically. We have seen a $100 million trade done on a mobile phone, and on peak days in 2016, $200 billion in FX was traded through our electronic channels, including our own J.P. Morgan Markets platform, which provides a range of services from research to pre- and post-trade reporting. The electronic evolution is advanc- ing, and the investments we’ve made, and will continue to make, already are proving their merit to our clients. Transforming transaction banking Our commitment to technological advancement also has helped us make significant progress in Treasury Services (TS) and Custody & Fund Services (CFS). As businesses that provide vital services to clients, both have benefited from the extensive resources we’ve allocated to them. To give a sense of the scale and importance of these two franchises, we hold and protect more than $20 trillion in assets under custody and securely process $5 trillion in pay- ments every day. Global companies know how vital these functions are in terms of safe- guarding their financial operations and enabling their businesses to run smoothly. Clients of both Treasury Services and Custody & Fund Services increas- ingly demand real-time access to their balances, intraday liquidity and ever faster processing capabilities. They are turning to us to deliver innovative products, alert them to fraudulent transactions, and track their finances across multiple curren- cies and countries. The goal is to give clients real-time information on their complex, global portfolios with easy- to-use, seamless technology. Clients look to these critical services to be faster and more accessible than ever before, which is why we have invested so heavily in these businesses. There’s more to do, but our efforts haven’t gone unnoticed. Greenwich Associates recently named 59 J.P. Morgan’s ACCESS OnlineSM the top-ranking cash management portal globally, as well as in North America. Our commitment to technology and delivery of innovative solutions were also important factors behind Black- Rock’s decision to award us a CFS mandate with $1.3 trillion in assets under management last year, the big- gest custody transaction in history. Clients are rewarding us with new and incremental business; the bank has increased business with existing custody clients by 10% in 2016, and the forward pipeline is strong. Over- all, the bank serves about 2,500 cus- tody clients in more than 100 markets. The faith that clients have in our capabilities is a validation of our investments and reflects our ability to collaborate across areas, such as Sales, Products, Technology and Operations. By 2017, TS is expected to increase its technology budget by 12% vs. 2014 with investments that include automating and streamlining the account opening process, digitizing document exchanges and expand- ing virtual branches. We’re also continually investing in cybersecu- rity capabilities to guard against fraud, malevolent attacks on our operations and other intrusions. We believe that by 2017, these improve- ments will help reduce operating expenses by 13% vs. 2014, while client operating balances jumped by 15% in just the last two years. Similarly, Custody & Fund Services will increase its technology budget by 30% vs. 2014 while driving down operating expenses by 12%. Using technology-driven solutions, CFS is enhancing its stability and enabling the business to grow in a more scalable way. After a few years of tightening con- trols and upgrading systems, we are now winning more business and attracting talented bankers and tech- nologists who are excited about our willingness to invest in and build new technologies. Building for the future We view last year as a transitional period in the financial markets. If the global economy continues improving, that should have a positive impact on client activity and gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. and in many of the developed and emerg- ing market economies. Estimates are that emerging markets ultimately will account for 70% of future GDP growth compared with its present share of worldwide GDP of 40%. If and when that shift occurs, J.P. Morgan will be prepared to serve the next generation of multi- nationals and to foster their develop- ment through the financing capabili- ties that we are uniquely able to offer. We will continue to build new prod- ucts and make it easier for clients to work with us, from onboarding to day-to-day trading and through the simplification of our processes. We have great assets, and no other bank is better positioned to deliver them to the global corporations of today or the ones sure to come into being in the next decades. But whether they’re long-established multination- als or startups looking to gain their own foothold in the global markets, we will never forget that they are at the center of what we do. 2016 HigH ligHTS And A CCoM pliSHMenTS • The CiB had record earnings of $10.8 billion on $35.2 billion of revenue, producing an Roe of 16% on a capital base of $64 billion. • We retained our #1 ranking in global Investment Banking fees with an 8.1% market share, according to dealogic. • The CiB had $19 billion of expenses, down $2.8 billion since 2014. • The CiB continued investing to embrace technology in order to offer clients a broader array of trading platforms in which to transact with J.p.

I’m excited to share our 2016 results, the investments we are making and our expectations for the future. 2016 performance For the year, Commercial Banking delivered strong financial results, with record revenue of $7.5 billion, $2.7 billion of net income and a return on equity of 16%. Notably, we absorbed incrementally higher capi- tal and substantial investments in our platform and capabilities while maintaining strong returns and oper- ating efficiency in the business. Our partnership with the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) continues to thrive and is a key differentiator for our business. Being able to provide strategic insights and leading capital markets and advisory capabilities dis- tinguishes us from every other com- mercial bank. In 2016, we delivered record gross investment banking rev- enue of $2.3 billion, up 5% from the prior year. This outstanding partner- ship accounted for 40% of the firm’s North American investment banking fees, and we believe there is tremen- dous opportunity to grow. Loan growth across our business was also outstanding, ending the year with record loan balances of $189 bil- lion, up $21 billion from the prior year. Loans in our Commercial & Industrial franchise reached a new record, up 9% from the prior year, and loans in our Commercial Real Estate businesses completed another fantastic year, with record origina- tions of $37 billion. Staying true to our proven underwrit- ing standards, we have remained highly selective in growing our loan portfolio. Despite pressures in the energy and commodities sectors, 2016 marked the fifth straight year of net charge-offs of less than 10 basis points. As we begin 2017, credit fun- damentals across CB are quite strong, but we remain disciplined and focused. We are monitoring all new activity carefully and know that this will serve us well over time. What’s not in our financial results also tells a great story. We have made significant investments to build a fortress risk and compliance framework for our business. More- over, we have executed a significant portion of our regulatory and con- trol priorities and are committed to set the standard in the industry. This progress has allowed us to focus on improving our processes to deliver a better client experience. It is an ongoing priority, and we will con- tinue to invest in safeguarding our clients and our business. Investing in our franchise to better serve our clients As strong as our business is, we are certainly not standing still. We are executing a multi-year transforma- tion across CB, with a clear focus on bringing greater value to our clients. Commercial Banking Across our company, our clients are at the center of everything we do. In 2016, this meant supporting our energy clients as they weathered one of the worst sector downturns in 30 years. With oil prices down almost 75%, the industry has felt tremendous stress. During this time, we stood by our clients and have provided mean- ingful advice and much-needed capi- tal. As many banks stepped away, we continued to demonstrate leadership in the industry, adding over 30 clients to our energy portfolio and extending more than $1 billion in new loan com- mitments last year. It was our disciplined client selection and deep sector expertise that gave us the confidence and resolve to provide unwavering support during this signif- icant downturn. I’m incredibly proud of our entire energy team for their relentless focus, leadership and hard work. We believe it is this enduring client commitment and our long-term view that set us apart in the industry. 2016 was a terrific year for Commer- cial Banking (CB) in so many ways, and our performance highlighted the strength and potential of our Expansion efforts have doubled Middle Market addressable client universe 2 1 prior years’ financials have been revised to conform to current presentation 2 Analysis based on dun & Bradstreet data for companies headquartered in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with revenue between $20 million and $500 million; excludes high-risk industries and industries not aligned to Middle Market 3 Represents total firm revenue from investment banking products provided to CB clients 4 does not include fees from Fixed income and equity Markets products, which are included in Commercial Banking gross investment banking revenue CAgR = Compound annual growth rate eop = end of period n.A. iB = north America investment Banking Clients (#) 820 1,100 1,360 1,470 1,670 1,970 2,220 18% loans eop ($B) $1.6 $4.4 $6.8 $8.2 $8.8 $10.7 $12.6 41% deposits ($B) $1.3 $3.0 $4.7 $6.0 $7.8 $8.2 $8.2 36% 2010–2016 CAGR Long-term target 2016201520142013201220112010 CAGR: 9% $1.3 $1.4 $1.6 $1.7 $2.0 $2.2 $2.3 $3.0 Long-term target 2016201520142013201220112010 19 Locations 45 Revenue CAGR: 41% $53 $139 $232 $297 $328 $352 $411 $1,000 Total Expansion Market Revenue1 $ in millions Commercial Banking Gross Investment Banking Revenue3 $ in billions CB clients represented 40% of CiB’s n.A. iB fees in 2016 4 61 Last year, we invested more than we ever have on technology, data and our key product capabilities. Looking forward, we will direct even more resources in 2017 to enhance our wholesale payments platforms, build upon our market-leading digital capa- bilities, use data to better manage risks, and drive improvements across critical processes like credit delivery and client onboarding. This is an effort with no finish line – through continuous innovation, we will seek better ways to serve our clients and extend our competitive advantages. Improving the client experience through enhanced digital delivery Given the rapidly increasing consumer and wholesale client expectations, we are focused on leading the industry in our digital and mobile capabilities. Our mission is to deliver greater speed, convenience, simplification, transparency and mobile access. We are working hand in hand with our partners in Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) and CIB to leverage their experience and technology investment in this area. In 2016, we joined CCB to launch a new digital platform that is specifically tailored to meet the needs of small and midsized companies. It works across desktops, tablets and mobile devices to provide an integrated experience across all of our products and services. We are excited that this new platform will help us bring innovative function- ality to our clients. Expanding our footprint to reach more clients Expanding our client base and build- ing deeper client relationships remain top priorities for CB. During 2016, we made significant progress in executing our long-term growth strategy – opening offices in eight new markets and hiring over 100 bankers across our business. These long-term investments are bringing us much closer to our clients. We made 20,000 more client calls last year than we did in 2015, and this focus will continue to drive opportu- nity for us in the coming years. Our Middle Market business in Cali- fornia is a great example of the prog- ress we’ve made so far and the tre- mendous potential we see in our expansion markets. It’s an extremely exciting market for us as it represents the sixth largest global economy. Our team entered California following the Washington Mutual acquisition in 2008, and we now have 13 offices across the state. We are delighted with our progress as we have added more than 450 clients, and we are growing with discipline, maintaining fantastic credit performance with essentially zero net charge-offs. Since 2010, our Middle Market team has opened 45 offices in major mar- kets, including Los Angeles, San 62 Our success depends completely on our people. They are knowledgeable, dedicated and deeply embedded in the communities they serve. I’m excited by the enthusiasm they show every day and am proud to work with such an incredible team. As always, we are optimistic about the U.S. economy and our clients’ role in driving growth and opportunity for CB. If we stay true to our proven strategy, we believe this team will continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders. • Real estate Banking — Completed its best year ever with record originations over $10 billion • Community development Banking — originated over $1 billion in new construction commitments, financing more than 10,000 units of affordable housing in 90+ cities Firmwide contribution • Commercial Banking clients accounted for 40% of total north American investment banking fees 4 • o ver $130 billion in assets under management from Commercial Banking clients, generating more than $460 million in Investment Management revenue • $475 million in Card Services revenue 3 • $2.8 billion in Treasury Services revenue Performance highlights • d elivered record revenue of $7.5 billion • g rew end-of-period loans 13%; 26 consecutive quarters of loan growth • g enerated return on equity of 16% on $16 billion of allocated capital • Continued superior credit quality — net charge-off ratio of 0.09% Leadership positions • #1 U.S. multifamily lender 1 • #1 in perceived Customer Satisfac - tion, CFO magazine’s Commercial Banking Survey, 2016 • Top 3 in overall Middle Market, large Middle Market and Asset Based Lending Bookrunner 2 • Winner of greenwich Associates’ Best Brand Awards in Middle Market Banking — overall, loans or lines of credit, cash management, trade finance and investment banking, 2016 • Recognized in 2016 by greenwich Associates as #1 cash manage- ment overall satisfaction and #1 cash management market pene- tration in the $20 million–$500 million footprint Business segment highlights • Middle Market Banking — Added more than 700 new clients • Corporate Client Banking — Record gross investment banking revenue 3 • Commercial Term lending — Record originations of more than $20 billion Progress in key growth areas • Middle Market expansion — Record revenue of $411 million; 24% CAgR since 2011 • i nvestment banking — Record gross revenue of $2.3 billion; 10% CAgR since 2011 • i nternational Banking — Revenue 5 of $285 million; 8% CAgR since 2011 2016 HigH ligHTS And A CCoM pliSHMenTS Douglas Petno CEO, Commercial Banking Francisco, Boston, Miami and Wash- ington, D.C. We are in 48 of the top 50 markets in the U.S., and by the end of 2017, we will be in all 50. Through these efforts, we have organically built a nice-sized bank with over 2,200 clients, $13 billion of loans and $8 billion of deposits. Our Middle Market expansion strategy is a significant growth opportunity – one in which we believe will reach $1 billion in revenue over time. Our opportunity As we look forward, our strategic priorities are clear. We are going to continue to drive innovation and strengthen our business processes to improve the client experience, oper- ate with fortress principles and have the best team in all of our markets to serve our clients. We remain commit- ted to growing with discipline and will continue to take a long-term view with our business and our clients, investing for their success and ours. With these priorities guiding us, I’m excited by the future and the poten- tial of our business. We see enormous opportunity across our franchise as the investments we have made over the last several years have set a solid foundation. Expanding our footprint and adding new bankers puts us in front of a tremendous number of potential clients. Moreover, the en- hancements we are making in our platform and capabilities give us con- fidence in our ability to compete and add differential value to our clients. 1 Snl Financial based on Federal deposit Insurance Corporation data as of 12/31/16 2 Thomson Reuters as of year-end 2016 3 Investment banking and Card Services revenue represents gross revenue generated by CB clients 4 Calculated based on gross domestic invest- ment banking revenue for syndicated and leveraged finance, M&A, equity underwrit- ing and bond underwriting 5 overseas revenue from U.S. multinational clients CAgR = Compound annual growth rate 63 Wealth Management (AWM) has brought its fiduciary mindset to help clients navigate portfolios. Over these many decades, we have institutionalized our insights and passed on the cumulative wisdom and knowledge of those before us to incoming generations. Perhaps the two most important investment lessons passed on through these centuries are around long-term focus and diversification. Diversification across and within The major geopolitical events of 2016, namely the U.S. presidential election and Brexit, surprised many as the outcome of these two major votes had been deemed improbable. As such, market reactions were vola- tile and unsettling to many. The emotional response to such events often makes it difficult to objectively reassess and position portfolios. For 180 years – through countless political challenges and conflicts – J.P. Morgan Asset & asset classes helps clients avoid overexposure to a particular region or asset class, protecting their port- folios from significant drawdowns and enabling them to be nimble and take advantage of market opportunities when they arise. When investors make emotional decisions related to current events, the benefits of long-term investing and properly diversified portfolios can be eroded. Instead of focusing on proper long- term, diversified investment portfo- lios, today’s debate is centered more on how to invest. Questions relating to “active vs. passive” investing and “humans vs. computers” have taken over the headlines. We believe proper portfolio construc- tion should include both active and passive strategies, depending on a client’s time horizon and risk profile. We also believe advisors and technol- ogy need to work together. Clients want to choose how, when and from where they interact with us – whether it’s through online platforms, on the phone or face to face. The person-to- person interaction becomes even more important as our clients’ lives grow more complex and they require more comprehensive advice.

We have direct relationships with 60% of the world’s largest pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and central banks and 50% of the world’s wealthiest individuals and families. We also deliver our insights and advice to more than 1 million U.S. families through Chase Wealth Management. These clients can choose to work with any firm they wish. They turn to J.P. Morgan because they know we will be there for them when they need us most and that we will always put their interests first. World-class investment performance While trust is the primary reason clients choose J.P. Morgan, our supe- rior investment performance is also critically important to the compound- ing of clients’ wealth. In 2016, 83% of our 10-year, long-term mutual fund assets under management (AUM) ranked in the top two quartiles. Our market-leading performance spans asset classes – 90% of assets for multi-asset solutions and alterna- tives, 84% for equity and 77% for fixed income ranked in the top two quartiles over the 10-year period. This outstanding track record has resulted in 140 of our equity strate- gies and 41 of our fixed income strategies receiving a four- or five- star ranking from Morningstar. This consistent performance also has led to clients entrusting J.P. Morgan with more of their assets. Over the past five years, we ranked #2 in total inflows among our large public peers, with an average of $82 billion annu- ally and $408 billion cumulatively. A diverse and balanced business mix driving strong financial performance Much like the portfolios we manage, our business is diversified across asset classes, regions and client types. That diversity, coupled with our proven track record, has led to strong finan- cial performance for AWM. In 2016, we delivered $12 billion in revenue and record pre-tax income of $3.5 billion. We also reached a record $2.5 trillion in total client assets. These numbers have consis- tently grown over the past five years, with a 5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for revenue and client assets and a 7% rate for pre- tax income. In addition, clients are increasingly using us for their primary banking services. Wealth Management depos- its grew to $290 billion in 2016 and recorded an impressive 19% CAGR over the past decade. In credit, our $121 billion in loan balances, includ- ing mortgages, represent a 15% CAGR over the past 10 years. Our focus on strong risk management has helped us do that while main- taining charge-off rates that are among the lowest in the industry. % of 2016 J.P.

Morgan a place where our people can have long and successful careers. We have a history of investing in our people at every level, from the thou- sands of training sessions and lead- ership development courses to our continuous work on talent mobility. Over the past five years, we’ve increased our front-office spend by 14% to ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right roles. As a result of this com- mitment to developing our talent, we proudly maintained a top talent retention rate of over 95%. One of the best ways we can invest in our people is by also investing in our technology. Our emphasis is on hav- ing a technology platform that allows us to automate and improve processes while, at the same time, helps our advisors to serve clients more quickly and efficiently, as well as focus on the value-added client work. We have successfully reduced our legacy technology footprint and error rates and significantly increased our spend on forward- looking initiatives. These efforts include building out an enhanced digital wealth management plat- form that will launch later this year and introducing new client man- agement systems for our advisors. Asset & Wealth Management — difficult to replicate One of the keys to our success has been our ability to bring to the table a unique combination of a two-century heritage and a focus on continuous investment, innovation and improvement. That means clients can have confidence that we will be there for them over the long term and also know that we have the foresight to adapt and innovate to help them through whatever the future brings. The long-term focus of this business is part of what makes AWM so dif- ficult to replicate. A franchise with a 10-year investment performance track record, a 50-year relationship with a state pension fund and a 100-year relationship with a multi- generational family cannot be built overnight. The culture of our firm – both what we do and how we do it – is equally special and one of our greatest competitive advantages. When you combine our AWM capa- bilities with the world’s leading investment, consumer and commer- cial banks, our story is even more powerful and enables us to bring the best the firm has to offer to help solve our clients’ most important issues. I am so proud to be part of this great firm and our AWM business. Our commitment to you, our sharehold- ers, is that we will continue to do first-class business in a first-class way so that we can create even more value for you and for our clients. 66 Corporate Responsibility peter Scher Peter Scher Head of Corporate Responsibility and Chairman of the Greater Washington Region At JPMorgan Chase, we understand that the success of our firm is directly linked to the success of our commu- nities. For us, corporate responsibility is a strategic imperative. By giving more people the opportunity to share in the rewards of a growing economy, we help build the foundation for more prosperous communities – and, in the process, help secure our firm’s long-term future. The importance of corporate respon- sibility is reflected in its integration throughout our operations. Our long-term initiatives and programs – backed by significant human and financial capital and informed by our firm’s expertise – are among the most externally visible indicators of the seriousness of our intent. So, too, are the ways in which we actively leverage our core business in service to our communities, deploying the capital and the credit that fuel eco- nomic growth. Bolstering these investments is the tremendous dedication of our people to serve our communities, including the hundreds of employees who applied to the JPMorgan Chase Ser- vice Corps, our highly selective pro- gram that embeds top-performing employees with many of our non- profit partners. That so many of our people eagerly throw their hats in the ring to leave their jobs, families and, in some cases, their countries for three weeks to lend their skills to our communities speaks volumes about who we are as a firm. Underpinning this ethos is a convic- tion that firms like ours have not only a responsibility and a vested interest in helping solve the chal- lenges facing our communities but also a vital contribution to make. The private sector’s capabilities, ingenu- ity and assets have time and again demonstrated their capacity to drive transformative change. JPMorgan Chase has answered this call by reimagining our approach to corporate responsibility. Based on our experience around the world, we have developed and refined a model that is informed by data and based on evi- dence about what’s most effective at driving inclusive growth. Our conclu- sion: Arm people with the skills needed for today’s high-quality jobs; provide small businesses – particu- larly minority-owned and community- based ones – with capital and resources; invest in community devel- opment that revitalizes not only urban cores but also surrounding neighbor- hoods; and give households the tools and resources to manage their finan- cial health. Taken together, these are four fundamental pillars of opportu- nity – and the focus of our efforts. Our model also reflects what we have learned are the essential ingredients for creating lasting impact. Critically, it must include a deliberate focus on strengthening the underlying organi- zations and systems that are needed to empower communities to deliver on – and sustain – change. Equally, it depends on forging meaningful part- nerships across the public, private and nonprofit sectors – and then actively leveraging our unique capabilities. Of course, every company has differ- ent assets and experiences to contrib- ute – from Google’s initiatives that harness its employees’ passion for technology to give back to their com- munities to IBM’s pioneering skilled volunteerism program that demon- strates what can be achieved when firms lend their people’s expertise. Regardless of what we bring to the table, all of us can – and must – embrace the obligation to be a posi- tive force for progress and opportu- nity in our communities. 67 A MODEL FOR IMPACT Driving inclusive growth More people must have access to opportunity and the chance to move up the economic ladder, particularly in the world’s cities, where the benefits of revitalization are not reaching everyone. To achieve this mission, we have reimagined our approach to corporate respon- sibility. We are leveraging our firm’s data, global scale, talent and resources to invest in key drivers of inclusive growth: financial health, jobs and skills, neighborhood revitaliza- tion and small business expansion. We continually test, learn and iterate in order to create more widely shared prosperity and to strengthen the underlying systems needed to deliver sustainable change. A MODEL IN ACTION Jobs and skills Helping people get the skills they need to compete in today’s labor market is critical for expanding access to opportunity and promot- ing economic mobility. Yet even as the global economy improves, people around the world are being left behind. To help address this challenge, JpMorgan Chase is investing $325 million over five years to provide adults and young people around the world with critical support, education and training to build in-demand skills while provid- ing employers with the workforce they need to grow and compete in today’s economy. As part of these efforts, JpMorgan Chase launched New Skills for Youth in 2016, a $75 million global initiative to expand high-quality, career- focused education programs that lead to well- paying jobs and long-term careers. New Skills for Youth is expanding opportunity for young people through two approaches: a multimillion dollar competition, in collabora- tion with the Council of Chief State School offi- cers, which seeks to incentivize U.S. states to grow and strengthen their career and technical education systems; and, through global innova- tion sites, the development of career-focused education programs in cities and school dis- tricts around the world. Communities engaged in 2016: • Forty-three states and the district of Colum- bia submitted proposals to participate in the first phase of the competitive program. of these 44 submissions, we selected 24 states and the district of Columbia and then committed a total of $2.5 million to help them plan and implement long-term career- readiness programs. These states represent half of all K-12 enrollments in the U.S. • i n the second phase of the program in Janu- ary 2017, we selected 10 states and commit- ted a total of $20 million to help them exe- cute the career-readiness plans they developed during phase one of the initia- tive. Through ongoing engagement by JpMorgan Chase, these 10 states will have the opportunity to collaborate and learn from each other, receive targeted technical assistance to address their specific chal- lenges, and access lessons, best practices and other research drawn from the initiative. • Additionally, we have committed a total of $10.5 million to denver, detroit and new orleans to develop and expand innovative apprenticeship models and career-focused programs that equip high school students with the skills and education they need to pursue well-paying, long-term careers. Neighborhood revitalization our community development efforts focus on creating vibrant communities and neighbor- hoods that offer residents access to opportunity through partnerships, innovative financing and data to address the key drivers of inequality. launched in 2016, pRo n eighborhoods, our $125 million, five-year initiative, seeks to identify and support solutions for creating economic opportunity in disadvantaged neighborhoods around the country. pRo neighborhoods pro- motes collaboration across sectors and commu- nity-based innovators to ensure that economic growth does not stop at commercial corridors but extends into a city’s neighborhoods. This initiative focuses on three key areas: convening and supporting Community devel- opment Financial institution (CdFi) collabora- tives to work together to address specific community development challenges; providing seed capital that enables partners to develop and preserve affordable housing; and funding research on land use, housing trends and shift- ing demographics to identify data-driven neighborhood solutions. in o ctober 2016, Jp Morgan Chase announced $20 million for five community development organizations working to create economic opportunity in five U.S. cities: Atlanta, Chicago, detroit, Miami and n ew York. Small business expansion Small businesses are vital engines of job growth and economic stability in the neighbor- hoods they serve. They also have the potential to play a major role in lowering unemployment rates in dis- tressed neighborhoods. Yet many low- and moderate-income small businesses lack access to vital resources needed for success. Through our efforts in detroit, we have learned that supporting underserved entrepreneurs is essential to the city’s transformation. These insights led us to refine and sharpen our focus on helping underserved entrepreneurs connect with capital to drive sustainable, widespread and inclusive growth. in october 2016, JpMorgan Chase more than doubled the size of the global Small Business Forward program, committing $75 million over the next three years to connect underserved small businesses with capital, targeted techni- cal assistance and support networks to help them grow faster, create jobs and strengthen local economies. 68 2016 HigH ligHTS And A CCoM pliSHMenTS • JpMorgan Chase’s $100 million commitment to detroit announced in 2014, half of which we are investing in two CdFis — to fund and catalyze further investment in housing, commercial and man- ufacturing — has supported more than $270 million in such projects, created or preserved over 800 units of housing and created nearly 800 jobs. • Announced nine financial services innovators as winners of the sec- ond competition of the Financial Solutions Lab aimed at identifying solutions that help consumers prepare for, and weather, financial shocks. Each winner received $250,000 in capital to enhance and scale the availability of their products and services. More than 70 of our employees leveraged their expertise and networks to help the Lab winners improve their products and increase their reach. To date, the Financial Solu- tions Lab has supported 18 fintech companies offering innovative financial products to help more than 1 million Americans improve their financial health. • e ngaged over 1,800 young people in summer jobs and other work- related experiences in 21 cities across the U.S. • Underwrote more than $5 billion in green, social and sustainability themed bonds and facilitated over $1.9 billion of capital for renew- able energy projects in the U.S. • Committed to strengthening appren- ticeship systems around the world through a $9 million investment by supporting the development of inno- vative apprenticeship models in high-growth fields; expanding exist- ing high-quality programs to serve young people from disadvantaged backgrounds; and bolstering the case for private investment in apprenticeship through first-of- its-kind research measuring the employer return on investment for apprenticeship programs. • The talent and expertise of our people are key components of our model for impact and are central to all of our efforts. In 2016, 50,000 of our employees volun- teered more than 325,000 hours of their time. And through the JpMorgan Chase Service Corps, 64 employees applied their skills and expertise to help our non- profit partners expand their capacity, contributing more than 9,600 hours with an approximate market value of $1.4 million. JpMorgan Chase received Euromoney’s 2016 World’s Best Bank for Corporate Social Responsibility award for our commitment and innovative approach to addressing economic opportunity around the world. As part of these efforts, JpMorgan Chase part- nered with liftFund and committed $4.6 million to support the launch of liftUp, a new web- based small business lending program to increase access to capital for underserved minority- and women-owned small businesses in the southern U.S. liftUp will provide small businesses faster access to affordable small business loans, reducing lending approval time from an average of five weeks to four days. Additionally, JpMorgan Chase partnered with the Association for e nterprise o pportunity and committed $1.9 million to support the advancement of a new technology-enabled platform that will serve as an industry utility connecting small businesses with CdFi lend- ers when the owners are unable to qualify for traditional loans. Data and analysis Almost two years ago, we established the JPMorgan Chase Institute: a global economic think tank dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses for the public good. The Institute utilizes our proprietary data, augmented by firmwide expertise and market access, to provide insights on the global economy and offer inno- vative analyses to advance economic prosperity. In 2016, the Institute uncovered fresh insights on: • Household income volatility, particularly in the wake of extraordinary payments; • The impact of the online platform economy as a way for consumers to manage this vola- tility and the slowing participation growth within the online platform economy; • Consumers’ response to the sustained drop in the price of fuel; • Small business cash flow and cash reserves (“cash buffer days”) they have on hand to weather financial volatility; • The economic impact of daylight Savings Time; • The role of unemployment insurance and the financial decisions households make after receiving it; • n early a full year of the l ocal Consumer Commerce Index, measuring consumer spending growth in 15 U.S. cities and in aggregate.

See Capital Risk Management on pages 76–85 for additional information on Basel III. Summary of 2016 results JPMorgan Chase reported strong results for full year 2016 with net income of $24.7 billion, or $6.19 per share, on net revenue of $95.7 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 10% and ROTCE of 13%. Net income increased 1% compared with the prior year driven by lower noninterest expense and higher net revenue, predominantly offset by higher income tax expense and provision for credit losses. Total net revenue increased by 2% primarily reflecting higher net interest income across all the Firm’s business segments and higher Markets noninterest revenue in CIB, partially offset by lower card income in CCB and lower asset management fees in AWM. Noninterest expense was $55.8 billion, down 5% compared with the prior year, driven by lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $5.4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, reflecting an increase in the total consumer provision related to additions in the allowance for loan losses and higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio, and a lower benefit in the residential real estate portfolio driven by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior year. The wholesale provision had a modest increase, largely driven by the impact of downgrades in the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios. The total allowance for credit losses was $14.9 billion at December 31, 2016, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio, excluding the PCI portfolio, of 1.34%, compared with 1.37% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.5 billion, an increase from the prior-year level of $7.0 billion. Firmwide average core loans increased 15% compared with the prior year. Within CCB, average core loans increased 20% from the prior year. CCB had record growth in average deposits, with a 10% increase from the prior year. Credit card sales volume increased 10%, and merchant processing volume increased 12%, from the prior year. CCB had nearly 27 million active mobile customers at year-end 2016, an increase of 16% from the prior year. CIB maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees with a 8.1% wallet share for the full-year ended December 31, 2016. Within CB, record average loans increased 14% from the prior year as loans in the commercial and industrial client segment increased 9% and loans in the wholesale commercial real estate client segment increased 18%. AWM had record average loans, an increase of 5% over the prior year, and 79% of AWM’s mutual fund assets under management ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartiles over the past 5 years. For a detailed discussion of results by line of business (“LOB”), refer to the Business Segment Results on pages 51–52. The Firm added to its capital, ending the full-year of 2016 with a TBVPS of $51.44, up 7% over the prior year. The Firm’s estimated Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In CET1 capital and ratio were $182 billion and 12.2%, respectively. The Fully Phased-In supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) for the Firm and for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The Firm also was compliant with the Fully Phased-In U.S. LCR and had $524 billion of HQLA as of December 31, 2016. For further discussion of the LCR and HQLA, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110–115. ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Core loans are considered a key performance measure. Each of the Fully Phased-In capital and leverage measures is considered a key regulatory capital measure.

Management’s discussion and analysis 38 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report JPMorgan Chase continues to support consumers, businesses and communities around the globe. The Firm provided credit and raised capital of $2.4 trillion for commercial and consumer clients during the full-year of 2016: • $265 billion of credit for consumers • $24 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses • $772 billion of credit for corporations • $1.2 trillion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities • $90 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities On October 1, 2016, the Firm filed with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its submission (the “2016 Resolution Submission”) describing how the Firm remediated certain deficiencies, and providing a status report on its actions to address certain shortcomings, that had been identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in April 2016 when those agencies provided feedback to the Firm as well as to seven other systemically important domestic banking institutions on their respective 2015 Resolution Plans. Among the steps taken by the Firm to address the identified deficiencies and shortcomings were: (i) establishing a new subsidiary that has become an “intermediate holding company” and to which JPMorgan Chase & Co. has contributed the stock of substantially all of its direct subsidiaries (other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as well as other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to JPMorgan Chase & Co.; (ii) increasing the Firm’s liquidity reserves and pre-positioning significant amounts of capital and liquidity at the Firm’s “material legal entities” (as defined in the 2016 Resolution Submission); (iii) refining the Firm’s liquidity and capital governance frameworks, including establishing a Firmwide “trigger framework” that identifies key actions and escalations that would need to be taken, as well as decisions that would need to be made, at critical points in time if certain defined liquidity and/or capital metrics were to fall below defined thresholds; (iv) establishing clear, actionable legal entity rationalization criteria and related governance procedures; and (v) improving divestiture readiness, including determining and analyzing divestiture options in a crisis. On December 13, 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC informed the Firm that they had determined that the Firm’s 2016 Resolution Submission adequately remediated the identified deficiencies in the Firm’s 2015 Resolution Plan. For more information, see the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites, and the Firm’s website for the public portion of the 2016 Resolution Submission. Business outlook These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firm’s actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 138 and the Risk Factors section on pages 8–21. Business outlook JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for the full-year 2017 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business. The Firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. In the first quarter of 2017, management expects net interest income to increase modestly compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. During 2017, assuming no change in interest rates since December 31, 2016, management expects net interest income could be approximately $3 billion higher than in 2016, reflecting the Federal Reserve’s rate increase in December 2016 and expected loan growth. Management expects average core loan growth of approximately 10% in 2017. The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at or near historically low levels, reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. Management expects total net charge-offs of approximately $5 billion in 2017. In Card, management expects the portfolio average net charge-off rate to increase in 2017, but remain below 3.00%, reflecting continued loan growth and the seasoning of newer vintages, with quarterly net-charge offs reflecting normal seasonal trends. Management believes that the consumer allowance for credit losses could increase by approximately $300 million in 2017, reflecting growth across businesses, offset by reductions in the allowance for the residential real estate portfolio. Excluding the allowance related to the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines and Metals & Mining portfolios, management expects that the wholesale allowance for credit losses could increase modestly in 2017 reflecting growth across businesses. Continued stability in the energy sector could result in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. As management continually looks to enhance its credit loss estimation methodologies, the outlook for the allowance for credit losses does not take into consideration any such potential refinements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 39 The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing its expenses, while investing in growth and innovation. As a result, Firmwide adjusted expense in 2017 is expected to be approximately $58 billion (excluding Firmwide legal expense). In CCB, management expects Mortgage noninterest revenue to decrease approximately $700 million in 2017, driven by margin compression in a smaller mortgage market and continued run-off of the Servicing portfolio, as well as approximately $200 million of MSR gains in 2016 which are not expected to recur in 2017. Management expects Card Services noninterest revenue to decrease approximately $600 million in 2017, reflecting the amortization of premiums on strong new product originations and the absence in 2017 of a gain on the sale of Visa Europe interests in 2016, although total Card Services revenue is expected to increase due to strong growth in net interest income. In the first quarter of 2017, management expects CCB expense to increase by approximately $150 million, compared to the prior quarter. In CIB, Investment Banking revenue in the first quarter of 2017 is expected to be approximately in line with the fourth quarter of 2016, dependent on the timing of the closing of a number of transactions. Treasury Services revenue is expected to be approximately $950 million in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, management currently expects Markets revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to increase modestly compared to the prior year quarter, with results sensitive to market conditions in March in light of particularly strong revenue in March 2016. In Securities Services, management expects revenue of approximately $900 million in the first quarter of 2017. In CB, management expects expense of approximately $775 million in the first quarter of 2017. In AWM, management expects revenue to be approximately $3 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Management’s discussion and analysis 40 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, unless otherwise specified. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, see pages 132–134. Revenue Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Investment banking fees $ 6,448 $ 6,751 $ 6,542 Principal transactions(a) 11,566 10,408 10,531 Lending- and deposit-related fees 5,774 5,694 5,801 Asset management, administration and commissions 14,591 15,509 15,931 Securities gains 141 202 77 Mortgage fees and related income 2,491 2,513 3,563 Card income 4,779 5,924 6,020 Other income(b) 3,795 3,032 3,013 Noninterest revenue 49,585 50,033 51,478 Net interest income 46,083 43,510 43,634 Total net revenue $ 95,668 $ 93,543 $ 95,112 (a) Effective January 1, 2016, changes in DVA on fair value option elected liabilities previously recorded in principal transactions revenue are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). For additional information, see the segment results of CIB and Accounting and Reporting Developments on pages 58–62 and page 135, respectively. (b) Included operating lease income of $2.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 2016 compared with 2015 Total net revenue increased by 2% primarily reflecting higher net interest income across all the Firm’s business segments and higher Markets noninterest revenue in CIB, partially offset by lower card income in CCB and lower asset management fees in AWM. Investment banking fees decreased predominantly due to lower equity underwriting fees driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels. For additional information on investment banking fees, see CIB segment results on pages 58–62 and Note 7. Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting broad- based strength across products in CIB’s Fixed Income Markets business. Rates performance was strong, with increased client activity driven by high issuance-based flows, global political developments, and central bank actions. Credit revenue improved driven by higher market- making revenue from the secondary market as clients’ appetite for risk recovered. For additional information, see CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 58–62 and pages 69–70, respectively, and Note 7. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased reflecting lower asset management fees in AWM driven by a reduction in revenue related to the disposal of assets at the beginning of 2016, the impact of lower average equity market levels and lower performance fees, as well as due to lower brokerage commissions and other fees in CIB and AWM. For additional information, see the segment discussions of CIB and AWM on pages 58–62 and pages 66–68, respectively, and Note 7. For information on lending- and deposit-related fees, see the segment results for CCB on pages 53–57, CIB on pages 58–62, and CB on pages 63–65 and Note 7; on securities gains, see the Corporate segment discussion on pages 69– 70. Mortgage fees and related income were relatively flat, as lower mortgage servicing revenue related to lower average third-party loans serviced was predominantly offset by higher MSR risk management results. For further information on mortgage fees and related income, see the segment discussion of CCB on pages 53–57 and Notes 7 and 17. Card income decreased predominantly driven by higher new account origination costs and the impact of renegotiated co- brand partnership agreements, partially offset by higher card sales volume and other card-related fees. For further information, see CCB segment results on pages 53–57 and Note 7. Other income increased primarily reflecting: higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease assets in CCB a gain on the sale of Visa Europe interests in CCB a gain related to the redemption of guaranteed capital debt securities (“trust preferred securities”) the absence of losses recognized in 2015 related to the accelerated amortization of cash flow hedges associated with the exit of certain non-operating deposits a gain on disposal of an asset in AWM at the beginning of 2016 partially offset by a $514 million benefit recorded in the prior year from a legal settlement in Corporate. For further information on other income, see Note 7. Net interest income increased primarily driven by loan growth across the businesses and the net impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower investment securities balances and higher interest expense on long-term debt. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.1 trillion in 2016, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.25%, an increase of 11 basis points from the prior year. 2015 compared with 2014 Total net revenue for 2015 was down by 2%, predominantly driven by lower Corporate private equity gains, lower CIB revenue reflecting the impact of business simplification initiatives, and lower CCB Mortgage Banking revenue. These decreases were partially offset by a benefit from a legal settlement in Corporate, and higher operating lease income, predominantly in CCB. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 41 Investment banking fees increased reflecting higher advisory fees, partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting fees. The increase in advisory fees was driven by a greater share of fees for completed transactions as well as growth in industry-wide fee levels. The decrease in equity underwriting fees resulted from lower industry-wide issuance, and the decrease in debt underwriting fees resulted primarily from lower loan syndication and bond underwriting fees on lower industry-wide fee levels. Principal transactions revenue decreased reflecting lower private equity gains in Corporate driven by lower valuation gains and lower net gains on sales as the Firm exits this non-core business. The decrease was partially offset by higher client-driven market-making revenue, particularly in foreign exchange, interest rate and equity-related products in CIB, as well as a gain of approximately $160 million on CCB’s investment in Square, Inc. upon its initial public offering. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased largely as a result of lower fees in CIB and lower performance fees in AWM. The decrease was partially offset by higher asset management fees as a result of net client inflows into assets under management and the impact of higher average market levels in AWM and CCB. Mortgage fees and related income decreased reflecting lower servicing revenue, largely as a result of lower average third-party loans serviced, and lower net production revenue reflecting a lower repurchase benefit. For information on lending- and deposit-related fees, see the segment results for CCB on pages 53–57, CIB on pages 58–62, and CB on pages 63–65 and Note 7; on securities gains, see the Corporate segment discussion on pages 69– 70; and card income, see CCB segment results on pages 53– 57. Other income was relatively flat reflecting a $514 million benefit from a legal settlement in Corporate, higher operating lease income as a result of growth in auto operating lease assets in CCB, and the absence of losses related to the exit of non-core portfolios in Card. These increases were offset by the impact of business simplification in CIB; the absence of a benefit recognized in 2014 from a franchise tax settlement; and losses related to the accelerated amortization of cash flow hedges associated with the exit of certain non-operating deposits. Net interest income was relatively flat as lower loan yields, lower investment securities net interest income, and lower trading asset balance and yields were offset by higher average loan balances and lower interest expense on deposits. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.1 trillion in 2015, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a FTE basis, was 2.14%, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior year. Provision for credit losses Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Consumer, excluding credit card $ 467 $ (81) $ 419 Credit card 4,042 3,122 3,079 Total consumer 4,509 3,041 3,498 Wholesale 852 786 (359) Total provision for credit losses $ 5,361 $ 3,827 $ 3,139 2016 compared with 2015 The provision for credit losses reflected an increase in the total consumer provision and, to a lesser extent, the wholesale provision. The increase in the total consumer provision was predominantly driven by: a $920 million increase related to the credit card portfolio, due to a $600 million addition in the allowance for loan losses, as well as $320 million of higher net charge-offs, driven by loan growth (including growth in newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates compared to the overall portfolio), and a $470 million lower benefit related to the residential real estate portfolio, as the current year reduction in the allowance for loan losses was lower than the prior year. The reduction in both periods reflected continued improvements in home prices and lower delinquencies. The increase in the wholesale provision was largely driven by the impact of downgrades in the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios. For a more detailed discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see the segment discussions of CCB on pages 53–57, CIB on pages 58–62 , CB on pages 63–65, the Allowance For Credit Losses on pages 105–107 and Note 15. 2015 compared with 2014 The provision for credit losses increased as a result of an increase in the wholesale provision, largely reflecting the impact of downgrades in the Oil & Gas portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the consumer provision, reflecting lower net charge-offs due to continued discipline in credit underwriting, as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment levels. The decrease in the consumer provision was partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Management’s discussion and analysis 42 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Noninterest expense Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Compensation expense $29,979 $29,750 $30,160 Noncompensation expense: Occupancy 3,638 3,768 3,909 Technology, communications and equipment 6,846 6,193 5,804 Professional and outside services 6,655 7,002 7,705 Marketing 2,897 2,708 2,550 Other(a)(b) 5,756 9,593 11,146 Total noncompensation expense 25,792 29,264 31,114 Total noninterest expense $55,771 $59,014 $61,274 (a) Included legal (benefit)/expense of $(317) million, $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (b) Included FDIC-related expense of $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 2016 compared with 2015 Total noninterest expense decreased by 5% driven by lower legal expense. Compensation expense was relatively flat predominantly driven by higher performance-based compensation expense and investments in several businesses, offset by the impact of continued expense reduction initiatives, including lower headcount in certain businesses. Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of lower legal expense (including lower legal professional services expense), the impact of efficiencies, and reduced non-U.S. tax surcharges. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from growth in auto operating lease assets and higher investments in marketing. For a further discussion of legal expense, see Note 31. 2015 compared with 2014 Total noninterest expense decreased by 4% as a result of lower CIB expense, predominantly reflecting the impact of business simplification; and lower CCB expense resulting from efficiencies related to declines in headcount-related expense and lower professional fees. These decreases were partially offset by investment in the businesses, including for infrastructure and controls. Compensation expense decreased predominantly driven by lower performance-based incentives and reduced headcount, partially offset by higher postretirement benefit costs and investment in the businesses, including for infrastructure and controls. Noncompensation expense decreased reflecting benefits from business simplification in CIB; lower professional and outside services expense, reflecting lower legal services expense and a reduced number of contractors in the businesses; lower amortization of intangibles; and the absence of a goodwill impairment in Corporate. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense, largely associated with higher auto operating lease assets in CCB; higher marketing expense in CCB; and higher FDIC- related assessments. Legal expense was relatively flat compared with the prior year. Income tax expense Year ended December 31, (in millions, except rate) 2016 2015 2014 Income before income tax expense $34,536 $30,702 $30,699 Income tax expense 9,803 6,260 8,954 Effective tax rate 28.4% 20.4% 29.2% 2016 compared with 2015 The effective tax rate in 2016 was affected by changes in the mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, tax benefits related to the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, as well as the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based incentive payments. These tax benefits were partially offset by higher income tax expense from tax audits. The lower effective tax rate in 2015 was predominantly driven by $2.9 billion of tax benefits, which reduced the Firm’s effective tax rate by 9.4 percentage points. The recognition of tax benefits in 2015 resulted from the resolution of various tax audits, as well as the release of U.S. deferred taxes associated with the restructuring of certain non-U.S. entities. For additional details on the impact of the new accounting guidance, see Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 135 and for further information see Note 26. 2015 compared with 2014 The effective tax rate decreased predominantly due to the recognition in 2015 of tax benefits of $2.9 billion and other changes in the mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, partially offset by prior-year tax adjustments. See above for details on the $2.9 billion of tax benefits. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 43 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS The following is a discussion of the significant changes between December 31, 2016 and 2015. Selected Consolidated balance sheets data December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Change Assets Cash and due from banks $ 23,873 $ 20,490 17% Deposits with banks 365,762 340,015 8 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 229,967 212,575 8 Securities borrowed 96,409 98,721 (2) Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments 308,052 284,162 8 Derivative receivables 64,078 59,677 7 Securities 289,059 290,827 (1) Loans 894,765 837,299 7 Allowance for loan losses (13,776) (13,555) 2 Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 880,989 823,744 7 Accrued interest and accounts receivable 52,330 46,605 12 Premises and equipment 14,131 14,362 (2) Goodwill 47,288 47,325 — Mortgage servicing rights 6,096 6,608 (8) Other intangible assets 862 1,015 (15) Other assets 112,076 105,572 6 Total assets $ 2,490,972 $ 2,351,698 6% Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks The increase was primarily driven by deposit growth in excess of loan growth. The Firm’s excess cash is placed with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve Banks. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements The increase was due to higher demand for securities to cover short positions related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB, and the deployment of excess cash by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, see pages 110–115. Trading assets and liabilities–debt and equity instruments The increase in trading assets and liabilities was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB. The increase in trading assets reflected higher debt and, to a lesser extent, equity instrument inventory levels to facilitate client demand. The increase in trading liabilities reflected higher levels of client-driven short positions in both debt and equity instruments. For additional information, refer to Note 3. Trading assets and liabilities–derivative receivables and payables The change in derivative receivables and payables was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB. The increase in derivative receivables reflected the impact of market movements, which increased foreign exchange receivables, partially offset by reduced commodity derivative receivables. The decrease in derivative payables reflected the impact of market movements, which reduced commodity payables. For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on pages 102–103, and Notes 3 and 6. Securities The decrease was predominantly due to net sales, maturities and paydowns during the year of non-agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), corporate debt securities and asset-backed securities (“ABS”), offset by purchases of U.S. Treasuries. For additional information, see Notes 3 and 12. Loans and allowance for loan losses The increase in loans was driven by higher consumer and wholesale loans. The increase in consumer loans was due to retention of originated high-quality prime mortgages in CCB and AWM, and growth in credit card and auto loans in CCB. The increase in wholesale loans was predominantly driven by originations of commercial real estate loans in CB and commercial and industrial loans across multiple industries in CB and CIB. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was attributable to additions to the wholesale allowance driven by downgrades in the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios. The consumer allowance was flat from the prior year and reflected reductions in the allowance for loan losses in the residential real estate portfolio reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and due to runoff in the student loan portfolio; these factors were offset by additions to the allowance reflecting the impact of loan growth in the credit card portfolio (including newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates compared to the overall portfolio), as well as due Management’s discussion and analysis 44 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report to loan growth in the auto and business banking loan portfolios. For a more detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 86–107, and Notes 3, 4, 14 and 15. Accrued interest and accounts receivable The increase reflected higher receivables from merchants in CCB and higher client receivables related to client-driven activity in CIB. Mortgage servicing rights For additional information on MSRs, see Note 17. Other assets The increase reflected higher auto operating lease assets from growth in business volume in CCB and higher cash collateral pledged in CIB.

The consumer increase reflected continuing strong growth from existing and new customers, and the impact of low attrition rates. The wholesale increase was driven by growth in operating deposits related to client activity in CIB’s Treasury Services business, and inflows in AWM primarily from business growth and the impact of new rules governing money market funds. For more information on deposits, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 110–115; and Notes 3 and 19. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements The increase was predominantly due to higher client-driven market-making activities in CIB. For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, see pages 110– 115. Commercial paper The decrease reflected lower issuance in the wholesale markets consistent with Treasury and CIO’s short-term funding plans. For additional information, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110–115. Accounts payable and other liabilities The increase was largely driven by higher client-driven activity in CIB. Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs The decrease was predominantly due to a reduction in commercial paper issued by conduits to third parties, partially offset by net new credit card securitizations. For further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on pages 45–46 and Note 16. Long-term debt The increase was due to net issuance of structured notes driven by client demand in CIB, and other net issuance consistent with Treasury and CIO’s long-term funding plans, including liquidity actions related to the 2016 Resolution Submission. For additional information on the Firm’s long- term debt activities, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110–115 and Note 21. Stockholders’ equity The increase was due to net income offset partially by cash dividends on common and preferred stock, and repurchases of common stock. For additional information on changes in stockholders’ equity, see page 144, and on the Firm’s capital actions, see Capital actions on page 84. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 45 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The Firm is involved with several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated SPEs, which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). Special-purpose entities The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, including the mortgage- and asset- backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide market liquidity by facilitating investors’ access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. SPEs may be organized as trusts, partnerships or corporations and are typically established for a single, discrete purpose. SPEs are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and no employees. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. JPMorgan Chase uses SPEs as a source of liquidity for itself and its clients by securitizing financial assets, and by creating investment products for clients. The Firm is involved with SPEs through multi-seller conduits, investor intermediation activities, and loan securitizations. See Note 16 for further information on these types of SPEs. The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees. The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct. These rules prohibit employees from self-dealing and acting on behalf of the Firm in transactions with which they or their family have any significant financial interest. Implications of a credit rating downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could be required to provide funding if its short- term credit rating were downgraded below specific levels, primarily “P-1”, “A-1” and “F1” for Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, respectively. These liquidity commitments support the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by Firm- administered consolidated SPEs. In the event of a short- term credit rating downgrade, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., absent other solutions, would be required to provide funding to the SPE if the commercial paper could not be reissued as it matured. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding held by third parties as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $2.7 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper issued by these SPEs could increase in future periods should clients of the Firm-administered consolidated SPEs draw down on certain unfunded lending-related commitments. These unfunded lending-related commitments were $7.4 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Firm could facilitate the refinancing of some of the clients’ assets in order to reduce the funding obligation. For further information, see the discussion of Firm-administered multi- seller conduits in Note 16. The Firm also acts as liquidity provider for certain municipal bond vehicles. The Firm’s obligation to perform as liquidity provider is conditional and is limited by certain termination events, which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer and any credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. See Note 16 for additional information. Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments, and the Firm’s accounting for them, see Lending-related commitments on page 101 and Note 29. For a discussion of liabilities associated with loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications, see Note 29. Management’s discussion and analysis 46 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Contractual cash obligations The accompanying table summarizes, by remaining maturity, JPMorgan Chase’s significant contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2016. The contractual cash obligations included in the table below reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with terms that are both fixed and determinable. Excluded from the below table are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no obligation to return a stated amount of principal at maturity. The carrying amount of on-balance sheet obligations on the Consolidated balance sheets may differ from the minimum contractual amount of the obligations reported below.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 47 CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS (in millions) Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by/(used in) Operating activities $ 20,196 $ 73,466 $ 36,593 Investing activities (114,949) 106,980 (165,636) Financing activities 98,271 (187,511) 118,228 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (135) (276) (1,125) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and due from banks $ 3,383 $ (7,341) $ (11,940) Operating activities JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities, including the origination or purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale. Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources are sufficient to meet the Firm’s operating liquidity needs. Cash provided by operating activities in 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflected net income after noncash operating adjustments. Additionally, in 2016 cash provided reflected increases in accounts payable and trading liabilities related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB. The increase in trading liabilities reflected higher levels of client-driven short positions in both debt and equity instruments. Cash used in 2016 reflected an increase in trading assets, an increase in accounts receivable from merchants in CCB and higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in CIB; and higher net originations and purchases from loan held-for-sale activities. The increase in trading assets reflected higher debt and, to a lesser extent, equity instrument inventory levels to facilitate client demand. Cash provided in 2015 resulted from a decrease in trading assets, predominantly due to client- driven market-making activities in CIB, resulting in lower levels of debt and equity securities. Additionally, cash provided reflected a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower client receivables and higher net proceeds from loan sales activities. This was partially offset by cash used due to a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities, resulting from lower brokerage customer payables related to client activity in CIB. In 2014, cash provided reflected higher net proceeds from loan securitizations and sales activities. Investing activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating loans for investment, depositing cash at banks, and investing in the securities portfolio and other short- term interest-earning assets. Cash used in investing activities in 2016 resulted from net originations of consumer and wholesale loans. The increase in consumer loans was due to retention of originated high-quality prime mortgages in CCB and AWM, and growth of credit card and auto loans in CCB. The increase in wholesale loans was predominantly driven by originations of commercial real estate loans in CB and commercial and industrial loans across multiple industries in CB and CIB. Additionally, in 2016, cash outflows reflected an increase in deposits with banks primarily due to growth in deposits in excess of growth in loans; an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements due to higher demand for securities to cover short positions related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB and the deployment of excess cash by Treasury and CIO. Cash provided by investing activities during 2015 predominantly resulted from lower deposits with banks due to the Firm’s actions to reduce wholesale non-operating deposits; and net proceeds from paydowns, maturities, sales and purchases of investment securities. Partially offsetting these net inflows was cash used for net originations of consumer and wholesale loans, a portion of which reflected a shift from investment securities. Cash used in investing activities during 2014 resulted from increases in deposits with banks attributable to higher levels of excess funds; cash was also used for growth in wholesale and consumer loans in 2014. Partially offsetting these cash outflows in 2014 was a net decline in securities purchased under resale agreements due to a shift in the deployment of the Firm’s excess cash by Treasury and CIO. Investing activities in 2014 also reflected net proceeds from paydowns, maturities, sales and purchases of investment securities. Financing activities The Firm’s financing activities includes acquiring customer deposits, issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred and common stock. Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 resulted from higher consumer and wholesale deposits, and an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, predominantly due to higher client- driven market-making activities in CIB. Cash used in financing activities in 2015 resulted from lower wholesale deposits partially offset by higher consumer deposits. Additionally, in 2015 cash outflows were attributable to lower levels of commercial paper due to the discontinuation of a cash management product that offered customers the option of sweeping their deposits into commercial paper; lower commercial paper issuances in the wholesale markets; and a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements due to a decline in secured financings. Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 predominantly resulted from higher consumer and wholesale deposits. For all periods, cash was provided by net proceeds from long-term borrowings; and cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * For a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows, see Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 43–44, Capital Risk Management on pages 76–85, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 110–115. Management’s discussion and analysis 48 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES Non-GAAP financial measures The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 141–145. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These non-GAAP financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level, because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, see Business Segment Results on pages 51–70. Additionally, certain credit metrics and ratios disclosed by the Firm exclude PCI loans, and are therefore non-GAAP measures. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, see Credit Risk Management on pages 86–107. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis. 2016 2015 2014 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except ratios) Reported Results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Reported Results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Reported Results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Other income $ 3,795 $ 2,265 $ 6,060 $ 3,032 $ 1,980 $ 5,012 $ 3,013 $ 1,788 $ 4,801 Total noninterest revenue 49,585 2,265 51,850 50,033 1,980 52,013 51,478 1,788 53,266 Net interest income 46,083 1,209 47,292 43,510 1,110 44,620 43,634 985 44,619 Total net revenue 95,668 3,474 99,142 93,543 3,090 96,633 95,112 2,773 97,885 Pre-provision profit 39,897 3,474 43,371 34,529 3,090 37,619 33,838 2,773 36,611 Income before income tax expense 34,536 3,474 38,010 30,702 3,090 33,792 30,699 2,773 33,472 Income tax expense 9,803 3,474 13,277 6,260 3,090 9,350 8,954 2,773 11,727 Overhead ratio 58% NM 56% 63% NM 61% 64% NM 63% (a) Predominantly recognized in CIB and CB business segments and Corporate. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 49 Net interest income excluding CIB’s Markets businesses In addition to reviewing net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews net interest income excluding net interest income arising from CIB’s Markets businesses to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. CIB’s Markets businesses represent both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. The data presented below are non-GAAP financial measures due to the exclusion of net interest income from CIB’s Markets businesses (“CIB Markets”). Management believes this exclusion provides investors and analysts with another measure by which to analyze the non- markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

(c) Prior period amounts were revised to align with CIB’s Markets businesses. For further information on CIB’s Markets businesses, see page 61. Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as follows: Book value per share (“BVPS”) Common stockholders’ equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end Overhead ratio Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue Return on assets (“ROA”) Reported net income / Total average assets Return on common equity (“ROE”) Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) Net income* / Average tangible common equity Tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end * Represents net income applicable to common equity Management’s discussion and analysis 50 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE. Period-end Average Dec 31, 2016 Dec 31, 2015 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share and ratio data) 2016 2015 2014 Common stockholders’ equity $ 228,122 $ 221,505 $ 224,631 $ 215,690 $ 207,400 Less: Goodwill 47,288 47,325 47,310 47,445 48,029 Less: Certain identifiable intangible assets 862 1,015 922 1,092 1,378 Add: Deferred tax liabilities(a) 3,230 3,148 3,212 2,964 2,950 Tangible common equity $ 183,202 $ 176,313 $ 179,611 $ 170,117 $ 160,943 Return on tangible common equity NA NA 13% 13% 13% Tangible book value per share $ 51.44 $ 48.13 NA NA NA (a) Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE. Key performance measures The Firm’s capital, RWA, and capital and leverage ratios that are presented under Basel III Standardized and Advanced Fully Phased-In rules and the Firm’s, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s and Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s SLRs calculated under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules are considered key regulatory capital measures. Such measures are used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess the Firm’s regulatory capital position and to compare the Firm’s regulatory capital to that of other financial services companies. For additional information on these measures, see Capital Risk Management on pages 76–85. Core loans are also considered a key performance measure. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; and exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 51 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management (formerly Asset Management). In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 48–50.

The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items described in more detail below. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each line of business on at least an annual basis. For further information about line of business capital, see Line of business equity on page 83. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. Revenue sharing When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments agree to share revenue from those transactions. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing is used to allocate interest income and expense to each business segment and to transfer the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within Corporate. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements of a business segment as if it were operating independently. This process is overseen by senior management and reviewed by the Firm’s Asset- Liability Committee (“ALCO”). Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part of the funds transfer pricing process, largely all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividend to the business segments is aligned with the Firm’s process to allocate capital. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business segment’s net income applicable to common equity. Business segment capital allocation changes The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as common equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. Through the end of 2016, capital was allocated to the lines of business based on a single measure, Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA. Effective January 1, 2017, the Firm’s methodology used to allocate capital to the Firm’s business segments was updated. The new methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized Fully Phased-In RWA (as well as Basel III Advanced Fully Phased- In RWA), leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of Management’s discussion and analysis 52 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report capital in a severe stress environment. The methodology will continue to be weighted towards Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA because the Firm believes it to be the best proxy for economic risk. The Firm will consider further changes to its capital allocation methodology as the regulatory framework evolves. In addition, under the new methodology, capital is no longer allocated to each line of business for goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. Expense allocation Where business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain other costs related to corporate support units, or to certain technology and operations, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes parent company costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses; adjustments to align corporate support units; and other items not aligned with a particular business segment. The following provides a comparative discussion of business segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

(a) Included operating lease depreciation expense of $1.9 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (b) Included MSR risk management of $217 million, $(117) million and $(28) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management’s discussion and analysis 54 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 2016 compared with 2015 Consumer & Community Banking net income was $9.7 billion, a decrease of 1% compared with the prior year, driven by higher provision for credit losses predominantly offset by higher net revenue. Net revenue was $44.9 billion, an increase of 2% compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $29.7 billion, up 5%, driven by higher deposit balances and higher loan balances, partially offset by deposit spread compression and an increase in the reserve for uncollectible interest and fees in Credit Card. Noninterest revenue was $15.3 billion, down 2%, driven by higher new account origination costs and the impact of renegotiated co-brand partnership agreements in Credit Card and lower mortgage servicing revenue predominantly as a result of a lower level of third- party loans serviced; these factors were predominantly offset by higher auto lease and card sales volume, higher card- and deposit-related fees, higher MSR risk management results and a gain on the sale of Visa Europe interests. See Note 17 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. The provision for credit losses was $4.5 billion, an increase of 47% from the prior year. The increase in the provision was driven by: a $920 million increase related to the credit card portfolio, due to a $600 million addition in the allowance for loan losses, as well as $320 million of higher net charge-offs, driven by loan growth, including growth in newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates compared to the overall portfolio, a $450 million lower benefit related to the residential real estate portfolio, as the current year reduction in the allowance for loan losses was lower than the prior year. The reduction in both periods reflected continued improvements in home prices and lower delinquencies and a $150 million increase related to the auto and business banking portfolio, due to additions to the allowance for loan losses and higher net charge-offs, reflecting loan growth in the portfolios. Noninterest expense of $24.9 billion was flat compared with the prior year, driven by lower legal expense and branch efficiencies offset by higher auto lease depreciation and higher investment in marketing. 2015 compared with 2014 Consumer & Community Banking net income was $9.8 billion, an increase of 7% compared with the prior year, driven by lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. Net revenue was $43.8 billion, a decrease of 1% compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $28.2 billion, down 1%, driven by spread compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit balances, higher loan balances largely resulting from originations of high-quality mortgage loans that have been retained, and improved credit quality including lower reversals of interest and fees due to lower net charge-offs in Credit Card. Noninterest revenue was $15.6 billion, down 2%, driven by lower mortgage servicing revenue largely as a result of lower average third-party loans serviced, lower net mortgage production revenue reflecting a lower repurchase benefit and the impact of renegotiated co-brand partnership agreements in Credit Card, largely offset by higher auto lease and card sales volume, the impact of non-core portfolio exits in Credit Card in the prior year, and a gain on the investment in Square, Inc. upon its initial public offering. The provision for credit losses was $3.1 billion, a decrease of 13% from the prior year, reflecting lower net charge- offs, partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The current-year provision reflected a $1.0 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to continued improvement in home prices and lower delinquencies as well as increased granularity in the impairment estimates in the residential real estate portfolio and runoff in the student loan portfolio. The prior-year provision reflected a $1.3 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to continued improvement in home prices and lower delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio, a decrease in the Credit Card asset-specific allowance resulting from increased granularity of the impairment estimates and lower balances related to credit card loans modified in troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), runoff in the student loan portfolio and lower estimated losses in auto loans. Noninterest expense was $24.9 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior year, driven by lower headcount-related expense and lower professional fees, partially offset by higher auto lease depreciation.

Banking revenue was $10.8 billion, down 6% compared with the prior year. Investment banking revenue was $6.0 billion, down 7% from the prior year, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, down 19% driven by lower industry-wide fee levels; however, the Firm improved its market share and maintained its #1 ranking in equity underwriting fees globally as well as in both North America and Europe and its #1 ranking by volumes across all products, according to Dealogic.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 59 Markets & Investor Services revenue was $24.4 billion, up 11% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $15.3 billion, up 21% from the prior year, driven by broad strength across products. Rates performance was strong, with increased client activity driven by high issuance-based flows, global political developments, and central bank actions. Credit and Securitized Products revenue improved driven by higher market-making revenue from the secondary market as clients’ risk appetite recovered, and due to increased financing activity. Equity Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, up 1%, compared to a strong prior-year. Securities Services revenue was $3.6 billion, down 5% from the prior year, largely driven by lower fees and commissions. Credit Adjustments and Other was a loss of $175 million driven by valuation adjustments, compared with an $11 million gain in prior-year, which included funding spread gains on fair value option elected liabilities. The provision for credit losses was $563 million, compared to $332 million in the prior year, reflecting a higher allowance for credit losses, including the impact of select downgrades within the Oil & Gas portfolio. Noninterest expense was $19.0 billion, down 11% compared with the prior year, driven by lower legal and compensation expenses. 2015 compared with 2014 Net income was $8.1 billion, up 17% compared with $6.9 billion in the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower income tax expenses largely reflecting the release in 2015 of U.S. deferred taxes associated with the restructuring of certain non-U.S. entities and lower noninterest expense partially offset by lower net revenue, both driven by business simplification, as well as higher provisions for credit losses. Banking revenue was $11.5 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. Investment banking revenue was $6.4 billion, up 4% from the prior year, driven by higher advisory fees, partially offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees. Advisory fees were $2.1 billion, up 31% on a greater share of fees for completed transactions as well as growth in the industry-wide fee levels. The Firm maintained its #2 ranking for M&A, according to Dealogic. Debt underwriting fees were $3.2 billion, down 6%, primarily related to lower bond underwriting and loan syndication fees on lower industry-wide fee levels. The Firm ranked #1 globally in fee share across high grade, high yield and loan products. Equity underwriting fees were $1.4 billion, down 9%, driven by lower industry-wide fee levels. The Firm was #1 in equity underwriting fees in 2015, up from #3 in 2014. Treasury Services revenue was $3.6 billion, down 3% compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower net interest income. Lending revenue was $1.5 billion, down 6% from the prior year, driven by lower trade finance revenue on lower loan balances. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $22.1 billion, down 5% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $12.6 billion, down 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of business simplification as well as lower revenue in credit-related products on an industry-wide slowdown, partially offset by increased revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets on higher client activity. The lower Fixed Income revenue also reflected higher interest costs on higher long-term debt. Equity Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by higher equity derivatives revenue across all regions. Securities Services revenue was $3.8 billion, down 13% from the prior year, driven by lower fees as well as lower net interest income. The provision for credit losses was $332 million, compared to a benefit of $161 million in the prior year, reflecting a higher allowance for credit losses, including the impact of select downgrades within the Oil & Gas portfolio. Noninterest expense was $21.4 billion, down 8% compared with the prior year, driven by the impact of business simplification as well as lower legal and compensation expenses.

Markets Revenue The following table summarizes select income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. For a description of the composition of these income statement line items, see Notes 7 and 8. Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is driven by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions. For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amounts recognized upon executing new transactions. 2016 2015 2014 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) Fixed Income Markets Equity Markets Total Markets Fixed Income Markets Equity Markets Total Markets Fixed Income Markets Equity Markets Total Markets Principal transactions $ 8,347 $ 3,130 $ 11,477 $ 6,899 $ 3,038 $ 9,937 $ 7,014 $ 2,362 $ 9,376 Lending- and deposit-related fees 220 2 222 194 — 194 222 2 224 Asset management, administration and commissions 388 1,551 1,939 383 1,704 2,087 345 1,684 2,029 All other income 1,014 13 1,027 854 (84) 770 1,399 59 1,458 Noninterest revenue 9,969 4,696 14,665 8,330 4,658 12,988 8,980 4,107 13,087 Net interest income 5,290 1,044 6,334 4,262 1,036 5,298 5,095 937 6,032 Total net revenue $ 15,259 $ 5,740 $ 20,999 $ 12,592 $ 5,694 $ 18,286 $ 14,075 $ 5,044 $ 19,119 Loss days(a) 0 2 0 (a) Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets posted losses.

Net revenue was $7.5 billion, an increase of 8% compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $5.1 billion, an increase of 14% compared with the prior year, driven by higher loan balances and deposit spreads. Noninterest revenue was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 2% compared with the prior year, largely driven by lower lending-and-deposit- related fees and other revenue, partially offset by higher investment banking revenue. Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, an increase of 2% compared with the prior year, reflecting increased hiring of bankers and business-related support staff and investments in technology. The provision for credit losses was $282 million and $442 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, with both periods driven by downgrades in the Oil & Gas portfolio and select client downgrades in other industries. 2015 compared with 2014 Net income was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 17% compared with the prior year, driven by a higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $6.1 billion, up 4% from the prior year, reflecting higher net interest income from higher deposit and loan spreads and continued loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower average equity market levels and lower placement fees. Noninterest expense was $8.5 billion, a decrease of 5%, predominantly due to a reduction in expense related to the disposal of assets at the beginning of 2016 and lower legal expense. 2015 compared with 2014 Net income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of 10% compared with the prior year, reflecting higher noninterest expense, predominantly offset by higher net revenue. Net revenue was $12.1 billion, an increase of 1%. Net interest income was $2.6 billion, up 5%, driven by higher loan balances and spreads. Noninterest revenue was $9.6 billion, flat from last year, as net client inflows into assets under management and the impact of higher average market levels were predominantly offset by lower performance fees and the sale of Retirement Plan Services (“RPS”) in 2014. Revenue from Asset Management was $6.3 billion, flat from the prior year as the sale of RPS in 2014 and lower performance fees were largely offset by net client inflows. Revenue from Wealth Management was $5.8 billion, up 2% from the prior year due to higher net interest income from higher loan balances and spreads and net client inflows, partially offset by lower brokerage revenue. Noninterest expense was $8.9 billion, an increase of 4%, predominantly due to higher legal expense and investment in both infrastructure and controls. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 67 AWM’s lines of business consist of the following: Asset Management provides comprehensive global investment services, including asset management, pension analytics, asset-liability management and active risk-budgeting strategies. Wealth Management offers investment advice and wealth management, including investment management, capital markets and risk management, tax and estate planning, banking, lending and specialty-wealth advisory services. AWM’s client segments consist of the following: Private Banking clients include high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, families, money managers, business owners and small corporations worldwide. Institutional clients include both corporate and public institutions, endowments, foundations, nonprofit organizations and governments worldwide. Retail clients include financial intermediaries and individual investors. Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance. • Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry- wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers mentioned in footnote (a). The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. • Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers mentioned in footnote (b). Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re- denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Management’s discussion and analysis 68 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Client assets 2016 compared with 2015 Client assets were $2.5 trillion, an increase of 4% compared with the prior year. Assets under management were $1.8 trillion, an increase of 3% from the prior year reflecting inflows into both liquidity and long-term products and the effect of higher market levels, partially offset by asset sales at the beginning of 2016. 2015 compared with 2014 Client assets were $2.4 trillion, a decrease of 2% compared with the prior year. Assets under management were $1.7 trillion, a decrease of 1% from the prior year reflecting the effect of lower market levels, partially offset by net inflows to long-term products.

(b) Included legal expense/(benefit) of $(385) million, $832 million and $821 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (c) Average core loans were $1.9 billion, $2.5 billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 2016 compared with 2015 Net loss was $704 million, compared with net income of $2.4 billion in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $487 million, compared with a gain of $267 million in the prior year. The prior year included a $514 million benefit from a legal settlement. Net interest income was a loss of $1.4 billion, compared with a loss of $533 million in the prior year. The loss in the current year was primarily driven by higher interest expense on long-term debt and lower investment securities balances during the year, partially offset by higher interest income on deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements as a result of higher rates. Noninterest expense was $462 million, a decrease of $515 million from the prior year driven by lower legal expense, partially offset by higher compensation expense. The prior year reflected tax benefits of $2.6 billion predominantly from the resolution of various tax audits. 2015 compared with 2014 Net income was $2.4 billion, compared with net income of $864 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $267 million, compared with $12 million in the prior year. The current year included a $514 million benefit from a legal settlement. Treasury and CIO included a benefit of approximately $178 million associated with recognizing the unamortized discount on certain debt securities which were called at par and a $173 million pretax loss primarily related to accelerated amortization of cash flow hedges associated with the exit of certain non- operating deposits. Private Equity gains were $1.2 billion lower compared with the prior year, reflecting lower valuation gains and lower net gains on sales as the Firm exits this non-core business. Noninterest expense was $977 million, a decrease of $182 million from the prior year which had included a $276 million goodwill impairment related to the sale of a portion of the Private Equity business. The current year reflected tax benefits of $2.6 billion predominantly from the resolution of various tax audits compared with tax benefits of $1.1 billion in the prior year. Management’s discussion and analysis 70 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Treasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO are predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding and structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks, as well as executing the Firm’s capital plan. The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Treasury and CIO achieve the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high- quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset- liability management objectives. For further information on derivatives, see Note 6. The investment securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, agency and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, other ABS, corporate debt securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities. At December 31, 2016, the investment securities portfolio was $286.8 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). During 2016, the Firm transferred commercial mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $7.5 billion from available-for-sale (“AFS”) to held- to maturity (“HTM”). These securities were transferred at fair value. The transfers reflect the Firm’s intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). See Note 12 for further information on the details of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 71 ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm’s approach to risk management covers a broad spectrum of economic and other core risk areas, such as credit, market, liquidity, model, principal, country, operational, compliance, conduct, legal, capital and reputation risk, with controls and governance established for each area, as appropriate. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires: • Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the lines of business and corporate functions; and • Firmwide structures for risk governance. The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and other senior executives, is the ultimate management escalation point in the Firm, and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible and accountable to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Firm strives for continual improvement through efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent Board oversight. The impact of risk and control issues are carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Management’s discussion and analysis 72 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following sections outline the key risks that are inherent in the Firm’s business activities: Risk Definition Select risk management metrics Page references I. Economic risks (i) Capital risk The risk that the Firm has an insufficient level and composition of capital to support its business activities and associated risks during both normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. Risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios; stress 76–85 (ii) Consumer Credit risk The risk of loss arising from the default of a customer. Total exposure; geographic and customer concentrations; delinquencies; loss experience; stressed credit performance 89–95 (iii) Wholesale Credit risk The risk of loss arising from the default of a client or counterparty. Total exposure; industry, geographic and client concentrations; risk ratings; loss experience; stressed credit performance 96–104 (iv) Country risk The risk that a sovereign event or action alters the value or terms of contractual obligations of obligors, counterparties and issuers, or adversely affects markets related to a particular country. Default exposure at 0% recovery; stress; risk ratings; ratings based capital limits 108–109 (v) Liquidity risk The risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. LCR; stress by material legal entity 110–115 (vi) Market risk The risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Firm’s assets and liabilities or future results, resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, implied volatilities or credit spreads; this includes the structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks managed on a firmwide basis in Treasury and CIO. VaR; P&L drawdown; economic stress testing; sensitivities; earnings-at-risk; and foreign exchange (“FX”) net open position 116–123 (vii) Principal risk The risk of an adverse change in the value of privately-held financial assets and instruments, typically representing an ownership or junior capital positions that have unique risks due to their illiquidity or for which there is less observable market or valuation data. Carrying value, stress 124 II. Other core risks (i) Compliance risk The risk of failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Risk based monitoring and testing for timely compliance with financial obligations 125 (ii) Conduct risk The risk that an employee’s action or inaction causes undue harm to the Firm’s clients, damages market integrity, undermines the Firm’s reputation, or negatively impacts the Firm’s culture. Relevant risk and control self-assessment results, employee compliance information, code of conduct case information 126 (iii) Legal risk The risk of loss or imposition of damages, fines, penalties or other liability arising from the failure to comply with a contractual obligation or to comply with laws, rules or regulations to which the Firm is subject. Not applicable 127 (iv) Model risk The risk of the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model status, model tier 128 (v) Operational risk The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors, or due to external events that are neither market- nor credit- related such as cyber and technology related events. Risk and control self-assessment results, firm- specific loss experience; industry loss experience; business environment and internal control factors; key risk indicators; key control indicators; operating metrics 129–130 (vi) Reputation risk The risk that an action, transaction, investment or event will reduce trust in the Firm’s integrity or competence by its various constituents, including clients, counterparties, investors, regulators, employees and the broader public. Not applicable 131 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 73 Governance and oversight The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by a “Risk Appetite” framework. The framework and the Firm’s risk appetite are set and approved by the Firm’s CEO, CFO, CRO and COO. LOB-level risk appetite is set by the respective LOB CEO, CFO and CRO and is approved by the Firm’s CEO, CFO, CRO and COO. Quantitative parameters and qualitative factors are used to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk against stated risk appetite. Quantitative parameters have been established to assess stressed net income, capital, credit risk, market risk, structural interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Qualitative factors have been established for select risks. Risk Appetite results are reported quarterly to the Board of Directors’ Risk Policy Committee (“DRPC”). The Firm’s CRO is the head of the Independent Risk Management (“IRM”) function and reports to the CEO and the DRPC. The CEO appoints the CRO to create the Risk Management Framework subject to approval by the DRPC in the form of the Primary Risk Policies. The Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who reports to the CRO, is also responsible for reporting to the Audit Committee for the Global Compliance Program. The Firm’s Global Compliance Program focuses on overseeing compliance with laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Firm’s products and services to clients and counterparties. The IRM function, comprised of Risk Management and Compliance Organizations, is independent of the businesses. The IRM function sets various standards for the risk management governance framework, including risk policy, identification, measurement, assessment, testing, limit setting (e.g., risk appetite, thresholds, etc.), monitoring and reporting. Various groups within the IRM function are aligned to the LOBs and to corporate functions, regions and core areas of risk such as credit, market, country and liquidity risks, as well as operational, model and reputational risk governance. The Firm places key reliance on each of its LOBs and other functional areas giving rise to risk. Each LOB or other functional area giving rise to risk is expected to operate its activities within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within their own management-identified risk and control standards. Because these LOBs and functional areas are accountable for identifying and addressing the risks in their respective businesses and for operating within a sound control environment, they are considered the “first line of defense” within the Firm’s risk governance framework. The Firmwide Oversight and Control Group consists of dedicated control officers within each of the lines of business and corporate functions, as well as having a central oversight function. The group is charged with enhancing the Firm’s control environment by looking within and across the lines of business and corporate functions to help identify and remediate control issues. The group enables the Firm to detect control problems more quickly, escalate issues promptly and engage other stakeholders to understand common themes and interdependencies among the various parts of the Firm. As the “second line of defense”, the IRM function provides oversight and independent challenge, consistent with its policies and framework, to the risk-creating LOBs and functional areas. Internal Audit, a function independent of the businesses and the IRM function, tests and evaluates the Firm’s risk governance and management, as well as its internal control processes. This function, the “third line of defense” in the risk governance framework, brings a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of the Firm’s governance, risk management and internal control processes. The Internal Audit Function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee. The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to senior management, the Firmwide Risk Committee, or the Board of Directors. Management’s discussion and analysis 74 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The chart below illustrates the key senior management level committees in the Firm’s risk governance structure. Other committees, forums and paths of escalation are in place that are responsible for management and oversight of risk, although they are not shown in the chart below. The Board of Directors provides oversight of risk principally through the DRPC, Audit Committee and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee. Each committee of the Board oversees reputation risk issues within its scope of responsibility. The Directors’ Risk Policy Committee of the Board oversees the Firm’s global risk management framework and approves the primary risk management policies of the Firm. The Committee’s responsibilities include oversight of management’s exercise of its responsibility to assess and manage the Firm’s risks, and its capital and liquidity planning and analysis. Breaches in risk appetite, liquidity issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Committee. The Audit Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of management’s responsibilities to assure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the assets and income of the Firm, assure the integrity of the Firm’s financial statements and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. In addition, the Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, independence and performance, and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal Audit function. The Compensation & Management Development Committee (“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s compensation programs and reviews and approves the Firm’s overall compensation philosophy, incentive compensation pools, and compensation practices consistent with key business objectives and safety and soundness. The Committee reviews Operating Committee members’ performance against their goals, and approves their compensation awards. The Committee also periodically reviews the Firm’s diversity programs and management development and succession planning, and provides oversight of the Firm’s culture and conduct programs. Among the Firm’s senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions are: The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of the risks inherent in the Firm’s businesses. The Committee is co-chaired by the Firm’s CEO and CRO. This Committee serves as an escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by its members, the Line of Business Risk JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 75 Committees, Firmwide Control Committee, Firmwide Fiduciary Risk Governance Committee, and regional Risk Committees, as appropriate. The Committee escalates significant issues to the DRPC, as appropriate. The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) provides a forum for senior management to review and discuss firmwide operational risks including existing and emerging issues, and operational risk metrics, and to review operational risk management execution in the context of the Operational Risk Management Framework (“ORMF”) which provides the framework for the governance, assessment, measurement, and monitoring and reporting of operational risk. The FCC is co-chaired by the Chief Control Officer and the Firmwide Risk Executive for Operational Risk Governance. The committee relies upon the prompt escalation of issues from businesses and functions as the primary owners of the operational risk. Operational risk issues may be escalated by business or function control committees to the FCC, which may, in turn, escalate to the FRC, as appropriate. The Firmwide Fiduciary Risk Governance Committee is a forum for risk matters related to the Firm’s fiduciary activities. The Committee oversees the firmwide fiduciary risk governance framework, which supports the consistent identification and escalation of fiduciary risk issues by the relevant lines of business; establishes policies and best practices to effectuate the Committee’s oversight responsibility; and creates metrics reporting to track fiduciary activity and issue resolution Firmwide. The Committee escalates significant fiduciary issues to the FRC, the DRPC and the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees review the ways in which the particular line of business or the business operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees. These committees may escalate to the FRC, as appropriate. LOB risk committees are co-chaired by the LOB CEO and the LOB CRO. Each LOB risk committee may create sub-committees with requirements for escalation. The regional committees are established similarly, as appropriate, for the region. In addition, each line of business and function is required to have a Control Committee. These control committees oversee the control environment of their respective business or function. As part of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing data which indicates the quality and stability of the processes in a business or function, reviewing key operational risk issues and focusing on processes with shortcomings and overseeing process remediation. These committees escalate to the FCC, as appropriate. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”), chaired by the Firm’s Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer under the direction of the COO, monitors the Firm’s balance sheet, liquidity risk and structural interest rate risk. ALCO reviews the Firm’s overall structural interest rate risk position, funding requirements and strategy, and securitization programs (and any required liquidity support by the Firm of such programs). ALCO is responsible for reviewing and approving the Firm’s Funds Transfer Pricing Policy (through which lines of business “transfer” interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO) and the Firm’s Intercompany Funding and Liquidity Policy. ALCO is also responsible for reviewing the Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan. The Firmwide Capital Governance Committee, chaired by the Head of the Regulatory Capital Management Office is responsible for reviewing the Firm’s Capital Management Policy and the principles underlying capital issuance and distribution alternatives and decisions. The Committee oversees the capital adequacy assessment process, including the overall design, scenario development and macro assumptions and ensures that capital stress test programs are designed to adequately capture the risks specific to the Firm’s businesses. The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The VGF is chaired by the firmwide head of the Valuation Control Group (“VCG”) (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the Corporate & Investment Bank, Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial Banking, Asset & Wealth Management and certain corporate functions, including Treasury and CIO. In addition, the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the Bank. The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this function acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the DRPC and Audit Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk measurement The Firm has a broad spectrum of risk management metrics, as appropriate for each risk category. For further information on risk management metrics, see table on key risks on page 72. Additionally, the Firm is exposed to certain potential low-probability, but plausible and material, idiosyncratic risks that are not well-captured by its other existing risk analysis and reporting metrics. These idiosyncratic risks may arise in a number of ways, such as changes in legislation, an unusual combination of market events, or specific counterparty events. The Firm has a process intended to identify these risks in order to allow the Firm to monitor vulnerabilities that are not adequately covered by its other standard risk measurements. Management’s discussion and analysis 76 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level and composition of capital to support its business activities and associated risks during both normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable it to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment. Prior to making any decisions on future business activities, senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to preserving the Firm’s capital strength. The Firm’s capital management objectives are to hold capital sufficient to: • Maintain “well-capitalized” status for the Firm and its principal bank subsidiaries; • Support risks underlying business activities; • Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in its businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments; • Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities; • Serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries; • Meet capital distribution objectives; and • Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy. These objectives are achieved through the establishment of minimum capital targets and a strong capital governance framework. Capital management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. The Firm’s minimum capital targets are based on the most binding of three pillars: an internal assessment of the Firm’s capital needs; an estimate of required capital under the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements; and Basel III Fully Phased-In regulatory minimums. Where necessary, each pillar may include a management-established buffer. The capital governance framework requires regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital positions, stress testing and defining escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 77 The following tables present the Firm’s Transitional and Fully Phased-In risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm’s Basel III ratios exceed both the current and Fully Phased- In regulatory minimums as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. For further discussion of these capital metrics and the Standardized and Advanced approaches, refer to Monitoring and management of capital on pages 78–82.

At December 31, 2016, the CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 0.625% resulting from the phase-in of the Firm’s 2.5% capital conservation buffer and 1.125%, resulting from the phase-in of the Firm’s 4.5% global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge. (d) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm on a Fully Phased-In Basel III basis. At December 31, 2016, the ratios include the Firm’s estimate of its Fully Phased-In U.S. GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. The minimum capital ratios will be fully phased-in effective January 1, 2019. For additional information on the GSIB surcharge, see page 79. (e) In the case of the SLR, the Fully Phased-In minimum ratio is effective beginning January 1, 2018. Management’s discussion and analysis 78 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Strategy and governance The Firm’s CEO, in conjunction with the Board of Directors, establishes principles and guidelines for capital planning, issuance, usage and distributions, and minimum capital targets for the level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and highly stressed environments. The DRPC assesses and approves the capital management and governance processes of the Firm. The Firm’s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the capital stress testing end-to-end control framework. The Capital Governance Committee and the Regulatory Capital Management Office (“RCMO”) support the Firm’s strategic capital decision-making. The Capital Governance Committee oversees the capital adequacy assessment process, including the overall design, scenario development and macro assumptions and ensures that capital stress test programs are designed to adequately capture the risks specific to the Firm’s businesses. RCMO, which reports to the Firm’s CFO, is responsible for designing and monitoring the Firm’s execution of its capital policies and strategies once approved by the Board, as well as reviewing and monitoring the execution of its capital adequacy assessment process. The Basel Independent Review function (“BIR”), which reports to the RCMO and has direct access to both the DRPC and Capital Governance Committee, conducts independent assessments of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework to ensure compliance with the applicable U.S. Basel rules in support of senior management’s responsibility for assessing and managing capital and for the DRPC’s oversight of management in executing that responsibility. For additional discussion on the DRPC, see Enterprise-wide Risk Management on pages 71–75. Monitoring and management of capital In its monitoring and management of capital, the Firm takes into consideration an assessment of economic risk and all regulatory capital requirements to determine the level of capital needed to meet and maintain the objectives discussed above, as well as to support the framework for allocating capital to its business segments. While economic risk is considered prior to making decisions on future business activities, in most cases, the Firm considers risk- based regulatory capital to be a proxy for economic risk capital. Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time. Basel III overview Capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries. Basel III presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA: a general (standardized) approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Certain of the requirements of Basel III are subject to phase-in periods that began on January 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (“transitional period”). Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these methodologies, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its bank regulators. Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate SLR. For additional information on SLR, see page 82. Basel III Fully Phased-In Basel III capital rules will become fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, at which point the Firm will continue to calculate its capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm manages each of the businesses, as well as the corporate functions, primarily on a Basel III Fully Phased-In basis. For additional information on the Firm, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s capital, RWA and capital ratios under Basel III Standardized and Advanced Fully Phased-In rules and SLRs calculated under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, all of which are considered key regulatory capital measures, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 48–50. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 79 The Firm’s estimates of its Basel III Standardized and Advanced Fully Phased-In capital, RWA and capital ratios and SLRs for the Firm, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. are based on the current published U.S. Basel III rules and on the application of such rules to the Firm’s businesses as currently conducted. The actual impact on the Firm’s capital ratios and SLR as of the effective date of the rules may differ from the Firm’s current estimates depending on changes the Firm may make to its businesses in the future, further implementation guidance from the regulators, and regulatory approval of certain of the Firm’s internal risk models (or, alternatively, regulatory disapproval of the Firm’s internal risk models that have previously been conditionally approved). Risk-based capital regulatory minimums The following chart presents the Basel III minimum CET1 capital ratio during the transitional periods and on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III rules currently in effect. The Basel III rules include minimum capital ratio requirements that are subject to phase-in periods through the end of 2018. The capital adequacy of the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries, both during the transitional period and upon full-phase in, is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) which results for each quarter in the lower ratio as required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Collins Floor”). Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 28. For further information on the Firm’s Basel III measures, see the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website (http:// investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm). All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum capital ratio of 4.5% of CET1 capital. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold additional amounts of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation buffer is intended to be used to absorb potential losses in times of financial or economic stress. If not maintained, the Firm could be limited in the amount of capital that may be distributed, including dividends and common equity repurchases. The capital conservation buffer is subject to a phase-in period that began January 1, 2016 and continues through the end of 2018. As an expansion of the capital conservation buffer, the Firm is also required to hold additional levels of capital in the form of a GSIB surcharge and a countercyclical capital buffer. Under the Federal Reserve’s final rule, GSIBs, including the Firm, are required to calculate their GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods, and are subject to the higher of the two. The first (“Method 1”), reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. The second (“Method 2”), modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”. Management’s discussion and analysis 80 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The Firm’s Fully Phased-In GSIB surcharge for 2016 was calculated to be 2.5% under Method 1 and 4.5% under Method 2. Accordingly, the Firm’s minimum capital ratios applicable in 2016 include a GSIB surcharge of 1.125%, resulting from the application of the transition provisions to the 4.5% fully phased-in GSIB surcharge. For 2017, the Firm has calculated its Fully Phased-In GSIB surcharge to be 2.5% under Method 1 and 3.5% under Method 2 resulting in the inclusion of a GSIB surcharge of 1.75% in the Firm’s minimum capital ratios after application of the transition provisions. The countercyclical capital buffer takes into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. On September 8, 2016 the Federal Reserve published the framework that will apply to the setting of the countercyclical capital buffer. As of October 24, 2016 the Federal Reserve reaffirmed setting the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer at 0%, and stated that it will review the amount at least annually. The countercyclical capital buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that credit growth in the economy has become excessive and can be set at up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. Based on the Firm’s most recent estimate of its GSIB surcharge and the current countercyclical buffer being set at 0%, the Firm estimates its Fully Phased-In CET1 capital requirement, at January 1, 2019, would be 10.5% (reflecting the 4.5% CET1 capital requirement, the Fully Phased-In 2.5% capital conservation buffer and the GSIB surcharge of 3.5%). As well as meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm must, in order to be “well-capitalized”, maintain a minimum 6% Tier 1 capital and a 10% Total capital requirement. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, JPMorgan Chase maintained Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve. The Firm continues to believe that over the next several years, it will operate with a Basel III CET1 capital ratio between 11% and 12.5%. It is the Firm’s intention that the Firm’s capital ratios continue to meet regulatory minimums as they are fully implemented in 2019 and thereafter. Each of the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries must maintain a minimum 6.5% CET1, 8% Tier 1 capital, 10% Total capital and 5% Tier 1 leverage requirement to meet the definition of “well-capitalized” under the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) for IDI subsidiaries.

(b) Portfolio runoff for credit risk RWA reflects reduced risk from position rolloffs in legacy portfolios in Mortgage Banking (under both the Standardized and Advanced framework), and for market risk RWA reflects reduced risk from position rolloffs in legacy portfolios in the wholesale businesses. (c) Movement in portfolio levels for credit risk RWA refers to changes in book size, composition, credit quality, and market movements; and for market risk RWA refers to changes in position and market movements. Supplementary leverage ratio The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on- balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure. U.S. bank holding companies, including the Firm, are required to have a minimum SLR of 5% and IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A., are required to have a minimum SLR of 6%, both beginning January 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2016, the Firm estimates that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s and Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s Fully Phased-In SLRs are approximately 6.6% and 9.6%, respectively. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s Fully Phased-In SLR as of December 31, 2016. (in millions, except ratio) December 31, 2016 Fully Phased-in Tier 1 Capital $ 207,474 Total average assets 2,532,457 Less: amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital 46,977 Total adjusted average assets(a) 2,485,480 Off-balance sheet exposures(b) 707,359 SLR leverage exposure $ 3,192,839 SLR 6.5% (a) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the SLR, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly goodwill and other intangible assets. (b) Off-balance sheet exposures are calculated as the average of the three month-end spot balances in the reporting quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 83 Line of business equity The Firm’s framework for allocating capital to its business segments (line of business equity) is based on the following objectives: • Integrate firmwide and line of business capital management activities; • Measure performance consistently across all lines of business; and • Provide comparability with peer firms for each of the lines of business. Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons and regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In). For 2016, capital was allocated to each business segment for, among other things, goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance. Line of business common equity Yearly average Year ended December 31, (in billions) 2016 2015 2014 Consumer & Community Banking $ 51.0 $ 51.0 $ 51.0 Corporate & Investment Bank 64.0 62.0 61.0 Commercial Banking 16.0 14.0 14.0 Asset & Wealth Management 9.0 9.0 9.0 Corporate 84.6 79.7 72.4 Total common stockholders’ equity $ 224.6 $ 215.7 $ 207.4 On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. Through the end of 2016, capital was allocated to the lines of business based on a single measure, Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA. Effective January 1, 2017, the Firm’s methodology used to allocate capital to the Firm’s business segments was updated. The new methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized Fully Phased-In RWA (as well as Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA), leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. The methodology will continue to be weighted towards Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA because the Firm believes it to be the best proxy for economic risk. The Firm will consider further changes to its capital allocation methodology as the regulatory framework evolves. In addition, under the new methodology, capital is no longer allocated to each line of business for goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. The Firm will continue to establish internal ROE targets for its business segments, against which they will be measured, as a key performance indicator. The table below reflects the Firm’s assessed level of capital required for each line of business as of the dates indicated.

The Federal Reserve uses the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act stress test processes to ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable them to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through the CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2016 capital plan. For information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 2016 CCAR results, see Capital actions on page 84. The Firm’s CCAR process is integrated into and employs the same methodologies utilized in the Firm’s ICAAP process, as discussed below. Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process Semiannually, the Firm completes the ICAAP, which provides management with a view of the impact of severe and unexpected events on earnings, balance sheet positions, reserves and capital. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. However, when defining a broad range of scenarios, realized events can always be worse. Accordingly, Management’s discussion and analysis 84 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report management considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as necessary. ICAAP results are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors. Capital actions Dividends The Firm’s common stock dividend policy reflects JPMorgan Chase’s earnings outlook, desired dividend payout ratio, capital objectives, and alternative investment opportunities. On May 17, 2016, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.48 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July 31, 2016. The Firm’s dividends are subject to the Board of Directors’ approval at the customary times those dividends are to be declared. For information regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22 and Note 27. The following table shows the common dividend payout ratio based on net income applicable to common equity. Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Common dividend payout ratio 30% 28% 29% Common equity During the year ended December 31, 2016, warrant holders exercised their right to purchase 22.5 million shares of the Firm’s common stock. The Firm issued from treasury stock 11.1 million shares of its common stock as a result of these exercises. As of December 31, 2016, 24.9 million warrants remained outstanding, compared with 47.4 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015. On March 17, 2016, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.9 billion of common equity (common stock and warrants) through June 30, 2016 under its equity repurchase program. This amount is in addition to the $6.4 billion of common equity that was previously authorized for repurchase between April 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. Following receipt in June 2016 of the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to the Firm’s 2016 capital plan, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.6 billion of common equity (common stock and warrants) between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity-based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2016, $6.1 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. There were no warrants repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Total number of shares of common stock repurchased 140.4 89.8 82.3 Aggregate purchase price of common stock repurchases $ 9,082 $ 5,616 $ 4,760 The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading blackout periods. All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilize Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities, see Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities on page 22. Preferred stock Preferred stock dividends declared were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. For additional information on the Firm’s preferred stock, see Note 22. Redemption of outstanding trust preferred securities The Firm redeemed $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of trust preferred securities in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 85 Other capital requirements TLAC On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued its final TLAC rule which requires the top-tier holding companies of eight U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies, including the Firm, among other things, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and external long-term debt that satisfies certain eligibility criteria (“eligible LTD”) by January 1, 2019. The minimum external TLAC requirement is the greater of (A) 18% of the financial institution’s RWA plus applicable buffers, including its GSIB surcharge as calculated under Method 1 and (B) 7.5% of its total leverage exposure plus a buffer equal to 2.0%. The required minimum level of eligible long-term debt is equal to the greater of (A) 6% of the financial institution’s RWA, plus its U.S. Method 2 GSIB surcharge and (B) 4.5% of the Firm’s total leverage exposure. The final rule permanently grandfathered all long-term debt issued before December 31, 2016, to the extent these securities would be ineligible only due to containing impermissible acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law. While the Firm may have to raise long-term debt to be in full compliance with the rule, management estimates the net amount to be raised is not material and the timing for raising such funds is manageable. Broker-dealer regulatory capital JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is JPMorgan Securities. Prior to October 1, 2016 the Firm had two principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries. Effective October 1, 2016 JPMorgan Clearing merged with JPMorgan Securities. JPMorgan Securities is the surviving entity in the merger and its name remain unchanged. JPMorgan Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). JPMorgan Securities is also registered as futures commission merchants and subject to Rule 1.17 of the CFTC. JPMorgan Securities has elected to compute its minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital Rule. At December 31, 2016, JPMorgan Securities’ net capital, as defined by the Net Capital Rule, was $14.7 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $11.9 billion. In addition to its minimum net capital requirement, JPMorgan Securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the SEC in the event that tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion, in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. As of December 31, 2016, JPMorgan Securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and is the Firm’s principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. It has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. PRA and the FCA. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is subject to the European Union Capital Requirements Regulation and the U.K. PRA capital rules, under which it has implemented Basel III. At December 31, 2016, J.P. Morgan Securities plc had estimated total capital of $34.5 billion, its estimated CET1 capital ratio was 13.8% and its estimated total capital ratio was 17.4%. Both ratios exceeded the minimum standards of 4.5% and 8.0%, respectively, under the transitional requirements of the European Union’s (“EU”) Basel III Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation, as well as the additional capital requirements specified by the PRA. Management’s discussion and analysis 86 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the default of a customer, client or counterparty. The Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its mortgage banking, credit card, auto, business banking and student lending businesses. Originated mortgage loans are retained in the mortgage portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of consumer loans are typically retained on the balance sheet. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities, investment securities portfolio, and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses are generally retained on the balance sheet; the Firm’s syndicated loan business distributes a significant percentage of originations into the market and is an important component of portfolio management. Credit risk management Credit risk management is an independent risk management function that monitors and measures credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The credit risk function reports to the Firm’s CRO. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities: • Establishing a comprehensive credit risk policy framework • Monitoring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval • Setting industry concentration limits and establishing underwriting guidelines • Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of all credit exposure • Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans • Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit risk-based capital management Risk identification and measurement The Credit Risk Management function measures, limits, manages and monitors credit risk across the Firm’s businesses. To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default. Based on these factors and related market-based inputs, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. Probable credit losses inherent in the consumer and wholesale held- for-investment loan portfolios are reflected in the allowance for loan losses, and probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments are reflected in the allowance for lending-related commitments. These losses are estimated using statistical analyses and other factors as described in Note 15. In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described in the Stress testing section below. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 132–134. The methodologies used to estimate credit losses depend on the characteristics of the credit exposure, as described below. Scored exposure The scored portfolio is generally held in CCB and predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans, certain auto and business banking loans, and student loans. For the scored portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time. The statistical analysis uses portfolio modeling, credit scoring, and decision-support tools, which consider loan-level factors such as delinquency status, credit scores, collateral values, and other risk factors. Credit loss analyses also consider, as appropriate, uncertainties and other factors, including those related to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the quality of underwriting standards, and other internal and external factors. The factors and analysis are updated on a quarterly basis or more frequently as market conditions dictate. Risk-rated exposure Risk-rated portfolios are generally held in CIB, CB and AWM, but also include certain business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB that are risk-rated because they have characteristics similar to commercial loans. For the risk- rated portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on estimates of the probability of default (“PD”) and loss severity given a default. The probability of default is the likelihood that a borrower will default on its obligation; the loss given default (“LGD”) is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. The estimation process includes assigning risk ratings to each borrower and credit facility to differentiate risk within the portfolio. These risk ratings are reviewed regularly by Credit Risk Management and revised as needed to reflect the JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 87 borrower’s current financial position, risk profile and related collateral. The calculations and assumptions are based on both internal and external historical experience and management judgment and are reviewed regularly. Stress testing Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties. Risk monitoring and management The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the line of businesses. Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be modified through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised as deemed appropriate by management, typically on an annual basis. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. In addition, wrong-way risk — the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing — is actively monitored as this risk could result in greater exposure at default compared with a transaction with another counterparty that does not have this risk. Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including: • Loan underwriting and credit approval process • Loan syndications and participations • Loan sales and securitizations • Credit derivatives • Master netting agreements • Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function, is responsible for: • Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale and commercial-oriented retail credit portfolios, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and • Evaluating the effectiveness of business units’ credit management processes, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/LGD rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. For further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans, see Note 14. Risk reporting To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision- making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, customer, product and geographic concentrations occurs monthly, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors as appropriate.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 89 CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO The Firm’s consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, business banking loans and student loans, and associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to benefit from discipline in credit underwriting as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment. Both early-stage delinquencies (30–89 days delinquent) and late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) for residential real estate, excluding government guaranteed loans, declined from December 31, 2015 levels. The Credit Card 30+ day delinquency rate and the net charge-off rate increased from the prior year but remain near record lows. For further information on consumer loans, see Note 14. The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the credit portfolio held by CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held by AWM, and prime mortgage loans held by Corporate.

Management’s discussion and analysis 90 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report (j) Net charge-offs and net charge-off rates excluded write-offs in the PCI portfolio of $156 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These write- offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. See Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 105–107 for further details. (k) Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $496 million and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off rates. Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Consumer loan balances increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, predominantly due to originations of high-quality prime mortgage and auto loans that have been retained on the balance sheet, partially offset by paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. The credit environment remained favorable as the economy strengthened and home prices increased. PCI loans are excluded from the following discussions of individual loan products and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm’s consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, see Note 14. Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from December 31, 2015 primarily reflecting loan paydowns and charge-offs. Both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies declined from December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans improved from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of loss mitigation activities. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016, declined when compared with the prior year as a result of improvement in home prices and delinquencies. At December 31, 2016, approximately 90% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consists of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and the remainder consists of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3–30 years. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC recasts into a loan with a 20-year amortization period. At the time of origination, the borrower typically selects one of two minimum payment options that will generally remain in effect during the revolving period: a monthly payment of 1% of the outstanding balance, or interest-only payments based on a variable index (typically Prime). HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan’s term. The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $34 billion at December 31, 2016. Of such amounts, approximately: • $13 billion have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified, • $15 billion are scheduled to recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments in future periods, and • $6 billion are interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The following chart illustrates the payment recast composition of the approximately $21 billion of HELOCs scheduled to recast in the future, based upon their current contractual terms. HELOCs scheduled to recast (at December 31, 2016) The Firm has considered this payment recast risk in its allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated amount of payment shock (i.e., the excess of the fully-amortizing payment over the interest-only payment in effect prior to recast) expected to occur at the payment recast date, along with the corresponding estimated PD and loss severity assumptions. As part of its allowance estimate, the Firm also expects, based on observed activity in recent years, that approximately 30% of the carrying value of HELOCs scheduled to recast will voluntarily prepay prior to or after the recast. The HELOCs that have previously recast to fully amortizing payments generally have higher delinquency rates than the HELOCs within the revolving period, primarily as a result of the payment shock at the time of recast. Certain other factors, such as future developments in both unemployment rates and home prices, could also have a significant impact on the performance of these loans. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. The Firm will continue to evaluate both the near-term and longer-term recast risks inherent in its HELOC portfolio to ensure that changes in the Firm’s estimate of incurred losses are appropriately considered in the allowance for loan losses and that the Firm’s account management practices are appropriate given the portfolio’s risk profile. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 91 Junior lien loans where the borrower has a senior lien loan that is either delinquent or has been modified are considered high-risk seconds. Such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than junior lien loans for which the senior lien loan is neither delinquent nor modified. At December 31, 2016, the Firm estimated that the carrying value of its home equity portfolio contained approximately $1.1 billion of current junior lien loans that were considered high risk seconds, compared with $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015. The Firm estimates the balance of its total exposure to high-risk seconds on a quarterly basis using internal data and loan level credit bureau data (which typically provides the delinquency status of the senior lien loan). The Firm considers the increased PD associated with these high-risk seconds in estimating the allowance for loan losses and classifies those loans that are subordinated to a first lien loan that is more than 90 days delinquent as nonaccrual loans. The estimated balance of these high-risk seconds may vary from quarter to quarter for reasons such as the movement of related senior lien loans into and out of the 30+ day delinquency bucket. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans. For further information, see Note 14. Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio predominantly consists of high-quality prime mortgage loans with a small component (approximately 2%) of the residential mortgage portfolio in subprime mortgage loans. These subprime mortgage loans continue to run-off and are performing in line with expectations. The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, increased from December 31, 2015 due to retained originations of primarily high-quality fixed rate prime mortgage loans partially offset by paydowns. Both early-stage and late- stage delinquencies showed improvement from December 31, 2015. Nonaccrual loans decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of loss mitigation activities. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016 remain low, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, included $9.5 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively, of mortgage loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, of which $7.0 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, were 30 days or more past due (of these past due loans, $5.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, were 90 days or more past due). The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included $19.1 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher- balance loans to higher-income borrowers. To date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader residential mortgage portfolio and the Firm’s expectations. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans. Auto: Auto loans increased from December 31, 2015, as a result of growth in new originations. Nonaccrual loans increased compared with December 31, 2015, primarily due to downgrades of select auto dealer risk-rated loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared with the prior year, as a result of higher retail auto loan balances and a moderate increase in loss severity. The auto portfolio predominantly consists of prime-quality loans. Business banking: Business banking loans increased compared with December 31, 2015 as a result of growth in loan originations. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2016 and net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased from the prior year as a result of growth in the portfolio. Student and other: Student and other loans decreased from December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the run-off of the student loan portfolio as the Firm ceased originations of student loans during the fourth quarter of 2013. Nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs also declined as a result of the run-off of the student loan portfolio. Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans decreased as the portfolio continues to run off. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 12% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 66% of the portfolio had been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. Substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment. Management’s discussion and analysis 92 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses. Summary of PCI loans lifetime principal loss estimates Lifetime loss estimates(a) Life-to-date liquidation losses(b) December 31, (in billions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 Home equity $ 14.4 $ 14.5 $ 12.8 $ 12.7 Prime mortgage 4.0 4.0 3.7 3.7 Subprime mortgage 3.2 3.3 3.1 3.0 Option ARMs 10.0 10.0 9.7 9.5 Total $ 31.6 $ 31.8 $ 29.3 $ 28.9 (a) Includes the original nonaccretable difference established in purchase accounting of $30.5 billion for principal losses plus additional principal losses recognized subsequent to acquisition through the provision and allowance for loan losses. The remaining nonaccretable difference for principal losses was $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (b) Life-to-date liquidation losses represent both realization of loss upon loan resolution and any principal forgiven upon modification. For further information on the Firm’s PCI loans, including write-offs, see Note 14. Geographic composition of residential real estate loans At December 31, 2016, $139.7 billion, or 63% of total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, were concentrated in California, New York, Illinois, Texas and Florida, compared with $123.0 billion, or 61%, at December 31, 2015. California had the greatest concentration of retained residential loans with 30% at December 31, 2016, compared with 28% at December 31, 2015. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans concentrated in California represented 55% of total PCI loans at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. The following charts illustrate the percentages of the total retained residential real estate portfolio held in the top 5 states, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans. For further information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s residential real estate loans, see Note 14. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 93 Current estimated loan-to-values of residential real estate loans The current estimated average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, was 58% at December 31, 2016 compared with 59% at December 31, 2015. Although the delinquency rate for loans with high LTV ratios is generally greater than the delinquency rate for loans in which the borrower has greater equity in the collateral, the average LTV ratios have declined consistent with improvements in home prices, reducing the number of loans with a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%. The current estimated average LTV ratio for residential real estate PCI loans, based on the unpaid principal balances, was 64% at December 31, 2016, compared with 69% at December 31, 2015. Of the total PCI portfolio, 4% of the loans had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 1% had a current LTV ratio greater than 125% at December 31, 2016, compared with 6% and 1%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. While the current estimated collateral value is greater than the net carrying value of PCI loans, the ultimate performance of this portfolio is highly dependent on borrowers’ behavior and ongoing ability and willingness to continue to make payments on homes with negative equity, as well as on the cost of alternative housing. For further information on current estimated LTVs of residential real estate loans, see Note 14. Loan modification activities – residential real estate loans The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted-average redefault rates of 21% for home equity and 22% for residential mortgages. The cumulative performance metrics for modifications to the PCI residential real estate portfolio that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 20% for home equity, 19% for prime mortgages, 16% for option ARMs and 32% for subprime mortgages. The cumulative redefault rates reflect the performance of modifications completed under both the U.S. Government’s Home Affordable Modification Program (“HAMP”) and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs (primarily the Firm’s modification program that was modeled after HAMP) from October 1, 2009, through December 31, 2016. Certain loans that were modified under HAMP and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs have interest rate reset provisions (“step-rate modifications”). Interest rates on these loans generally began to increase commencing in 2014 by 1% per year, and continue to do so, until the rate reaches a specified cap, typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate loan as of the modification date. At December 31, 2016, the carrying value of non-PCI loans and the unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in active step-rate modifications were $3 billion and $9 billion, respectively. The Firm continues to monitor this risk exposure and the impact of these potential interest rate increases is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. The following table presents information as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications of PCI loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans, and the impact of the modification is incorporated into the Firm’s quarterly assessment of estimated future cash flows. Modifications of consumer loans other than PCI loans are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For further information on modifications for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, see Note 14.

(b) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. For additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae, see Note 16. (c) Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans. (d) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, nonaccrual loans included $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, see Note 14. Management’s discussion and analysis 94 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets(a) December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Nonaccrual loans(b) Residential real estate $ 4,145 $ 4,792 Other consumer 675 621 Total nonaccrual loans 4,820 5,413 Assets acquired in loan satisfactions Real estate owned 292 277 Other 57 48 Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions 349 325 Total nonperforming assets $ 5,169 $ 5,738 (a) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, nonperforming assets excluded: (1) mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $5.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due; (2) student loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the FFELP of $263 million and $290 million, respectively, that are 90 or more days past due; and (3) real estate owned insured by U.S. government agencies of $142 million and $343 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (b) Excludes PCI loans which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans as they are all performing. Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio decreased to $4.1 billion from $4.8 billion at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of which 29% and 31% were greater than 150 days past due, respectively. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 43% and 44% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Active and suspended foreclosure: For information on loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure, see Note 14. Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in the consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Nonaccrual loans Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Beginning balance $ 5,413 $ 6,509 Additions 3,858 3,662 Reductions: Principal payments and other(a) 1,437 1,668 Charge-offs 843 800 Returned to performing status 1,589 1,725 Foreclosures and other liquidations 582 565 Total reductions 4,451 4,758 Net changes (593) (1,096) Ending balance $ 4,820 $ 5,413 (a) Other reductions includes loan sales. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 95 Credit card Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2015 due to strong new account growth and higher sales volume. The December 31, 2016 30+ day delinquency rate increased to 1.61% from 1.43% at December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net charge-off rates were 2.63% and 2.51%, respectively. The credit card portfolio continues to reflect a largely well- seasoned, rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S. geographic diversification. New originations continue to grow as a percentage of the total portfolio, in line with the Firm’s credit parameters; these originations have generated higher loss rates, as anticipated, than the more seasoned portion of the portfolio, given the higher mix of near-prime accounts being originated. These near-prime accounts have net revenue rates and returns on equity that are higher than the portfolio average. Loans outstanding in the top five states of California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois consisted of $62.8 billion in receivables, or 44% of the retained loan portfolio, at December 31, 2016, compared with $57.5 billion, or 44%, at December 31, 2015. The greatest geographic concentration of credit card retained loans is in California, which represented 15% and 14% of total retained loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For further information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans, see Note 14. Modifications of credit card loans At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. The decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from December 31, 2015, was attributable to a reduction in new modifications as well as ongoing payments and charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see Note 14. Management’s discussion and analysis 96 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO The Firm’s wholesale businesses are exposed to credit risk through underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services such as cash management and clearing activities. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale credit portfolio, excluding the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals & Mining portfolios, continued to be generally stable for the year ended December 31, 2016, characterized by low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. See industry discussion on pages 97–101 for further information. Growth in retained loans was predominantly driven within the commercial real estate portfolio in Commercial Banking, and across multiple commercial and industrial industries in Commercial Banking and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Discipline in underwriting across all areas of lending continues to remain a key point of focus. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable; and of industry, product and client concentrations.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection for credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. (d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2016, may become a payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, paying particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $19.8 billion at December 31, 2016, compared with $14.6 billion at December 31, 2015, driven by downgrades, including within the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals & Mining portfolios. Management’s discussion and analysis 98 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Below are summaries of the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Management’s discussion and analysis 100 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Presented below is a discussion of certain industries to which the Firm has significant exposures and/or which present actual or potential credit concerns. Real Estate Exposure to the Real Estate industry was approximately 16.1% and 14.6% of the Firm’s total wholesale exposure as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Exposure to this industry increased by $18.2 billion, or 16%, in 2016 to $135.0 billion primarily driven by Commercial Banking. The investment-grade percentage of the portfolio increased to 77% in 2016, up from 75% in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, $106.3 billion of the exposure was drawn, of which 83% was investment-grade, and 83% of the $135.0 billion exposure was secured. As of December 31, 2016, $80.1 billion of the $135.0 billion was multifamily, largely in California; of the $80.1 billion, 82% was investment-grade and 98% was secured. For further information on commercial real estate loans, see Note 14. Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines The following table presents Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline exposures as of December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015. December 31, 2016 (in millions, except ratios) Loans and Lending-related Commitments Derivative Receivables Credit exposure % Investment- grade % Drawn Exploration & Production (“E&P”) and Oilfield Services(a) $ 20,829 $ 1,256 $ 22,085 26% 34% Other Oil & Gas(b) 17,392 622 18,014 71 30 Total Oil & Gas 38,221 1,878 40,099 46 33 Natural Gas Pipelines(c) 4,253 106 4,359 66 30 Total Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines $ 42,474 $ 1,984 $ 44,458 48 32 December 31, 2015 (in millions, except ratios) Loans and Lending-related Commitments Derivative Receivables Credit exposure % Investment- grade % Drawn E&P and Oilfield Services(a) $ 23,055 $ 400 $ 23,455 44% 36% Other Oil & Gas(b) 17,120 1,502 18,622 76 27 Total Oil & Gas 40,175 1,902 42,077 58 32 Natural Gas Pipelines(c) 4,093 158 4,251 64 21 Total Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines $ 44,268 $ 2,060 $ 46,328 59 31 (a) Noninvestment-grade exposure to E&P and Oilfield Services is largely secured. (b) Other Oil & Gas includes Integrated Oil & Gas companies, Midstream/Oil Pipeline companies and refineries. (c) Natural Gas Pipelines is reported within the Utilities Industry. Exposure to the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios was approximately 5.3% and 5.8% of the Firm’s total wholesale exposure as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Exposure to these industries decreased by $1.9 billion in 2016 to $44.5 billion; of the $44.5 billion, $14.4 billion was drawn at year-end. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $21.4 billion of the exposure was investment-grade, of which approximately $5.3 billion was drawn, and approximately $23.1 billion of the exposure was noninvestment grade, of which approximately $9.0 billion was drawn; 21% of the total exposure to the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines industries was criticized. Secured lending, of which approximately half is reserve-based lending to the Exploration & Production sub-sector of the Oil & Gas industry, was $14.3 billion as of December 31, 2016; 44% of the secured lending exposure was drawn. Exposure to commercial real estate, which is reported within the Real Estate industry, in certain areas of Texas, California and Colorado that are deemed sensitive to the Oil & Gas industry, was $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. While the overall trends and sentiment have been stabilizing, the Firm continues to actively monitor and manage its exposure to these portfolios. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 101 Metals & Mining Exposure to the Metals & Mining industry was approximately 1.6% and 1.8% of the Firm’s total wholesale exposure as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Exposure to the Metals & Mining industry decreased by $630 million in 2016 to $13.4 billion, of which $4.4 billion was drawn. The portfolio largely consisted of exposure in North America, and was concentrated in the Steel and Diversified Mining sub-sectors. Approximately 41% and 46% of the exposure in the Metals & Mining portfolio was investment-grade as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While the overall trends and sentiment have been stabilizing, the Firm continues to actively monitor and manage its exposure to this industry. Loans In the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators and sales of loans, see Note 14. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Wholesale nonaccrual loans increased primarily driven by downgrades in the Oil & Gas portfolio. Wholesale nonaccrual loan activity(a) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Beginning balance $ 1,016 $ 624 Additions 2,981 1,307 Reductions: Paydowns and other 1,148 534 Gross charge-offs 385 87 Returned to performing status 242 286 Sales 159 8 Total reductions 1,934 915 Net changes 1,047 392 Ending balance $ 2,063 $ 1,016 (a) Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when management believes full payment of principal or interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal or interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans. Wholesale net charge-offs/(recoveries) Year ended December 31, (in millions, except ratios) 2016 2015 Loans – reported Average loans retained $ 371,778 $ 337,407 Gross charge-offs 398 95 Gross recoveries (57) (85) Net charge-offs 341 10 Net charge-off rate 0.09% —% Lending-related commitments The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfill its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s future credit exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, the Firm has estimated a loan-equivalent amount for each commitment. The loan-equivalent amount of the Firm’s lending-related commitments was $204.6 billion and $212.4 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into securities and derivative transactions. Through the provision of these services the Firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by central counterparties. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. For further discussion of clearing services, see Note 29. Management’s discussion and analysis 102 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Derivative contracts In the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. Derivatives enable customers to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange- traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options and “cleared” over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. For further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types, see Note 6. The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented. Derivative receivables December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Interest rate $ 28,302 $ 26,363 Credit derivatives 1,294 1,423 Foreign exchange 23,271 17,177 Equity 4,939 5,529 Commodity 6,272 9,185 Total, net of cash collateral 64,078 59,677 Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(a) (22,705) (16,580) Total, net of all collateral $ 41,373 $ 43,097 (a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained. Derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $64.1 billion and $59.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government bonds) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $22.7 billion and $16.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. The change in derivative receivables was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in CIB. The increase in derivative receivables reflected the impact of market movements, which increased foreign exchange receivables, partially offset by reduced commodity derivative receivables. In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative transactions move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements, see Note 6. While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable. Peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management. DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk. Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables at future time periods, including the benefit of collateral. AVG exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the CVA, as further described below. The three year AVG exposure was $31.1 billion and $32.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared with derivative receivables, net of all collateral, of $41.4 billion and $43.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment, the CVA, to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. The CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The primary components of changes in CVA are credit spreads, new deal activity or unwinds, and changes in the underlying market environment. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 103 risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the Firm’s exposure to a counterparty (AVG) and the counterparty’s credit quality. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with that counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative transactions, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative transactions. The accompanying graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio. Exposure profile of derivatives measures December 31, 2016 (in billions) The following table summarizes the ratings profile by derivative counterparty of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s. Ratings profile of derivative receivables Rating equivalent 2016 2015(a) December 31, (in millions, except ratios) Exposure net of all collateral % of exposure net of all collateral Exposure net of all collateral % of exposure net of all collateral AAA/Aaa to AA-/Aa3 $ 11,449 28% $ 10,371 24% A+/A1 to A-/A3 8,505 20 10,595 25 BBB+/Baa1 to BBB-/Baa3 13,127 32 13,807 32 BB+/Ba1 to B-/B3 7,308 18 7,500 17 CCC+/Caa1 and below 984 2 824 2 Total $ 41,373 100% $ 43,097 100% (a) Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity — was 90% as of December 31, 2016, largely unchanged compared with 87% as of December 31, 2015. Credit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. For a detailed description of credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 6. Credit portfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. For further information on derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, see Credit derivatives in Note 6. The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities; for further information on these credit derivatives as well as credit derivatives used in the Firm’s capacity as a market-maker in credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 6. Management’s discussion and analysis 104 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities Notional amount of protection purchased (a) December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Credit derivatives used to manage: Loans and lending-related commitments $ 2,430 $ 2,289 Derivative receivables 19,684 18,392 Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities $ 22,114 $ 20,681 (a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index. The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure. The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 105 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses covers both the consumer (primarily scored) portfolio and wholesale (risk- rated) portfolio. The allowance represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s loan portfolio. Management also determines an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. For a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 132–134 and Note 15. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm, and discussed with the DRPC and the Audit Committee. As of December 31, 2016, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The consumer allowance for loan losses remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2015. Changes to the allowance for loan losses included reductions in the residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvements in home prices and lower delinquencies, as well as runoff in the student loan portfolio. These reductions were offset by increases in the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth in the credit card portfolio (including newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates compared to the overall portfolio), as well as loan growth in the auto and business banking loan portfolios. For additional information about delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 89–95 and Note 14. The wholesale allowance for credit losses increased from December 31, 2015, reflecting the impact of downgrades in the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios.

(a) Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool (e.g., upon liquidation). (b) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. (c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 107 Provision for credit losses For the year ended December 31, 2016, the provision for credit losses was $5.4 billion, compared with $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The total consumer provision for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared with the prior year. The increase in the provision was driven by: • a $920 million increase related to the credit card portfolio, due to a $600 million addition in the allowance for loan losses, as well as $320 million of higher net charge-offs, driven by loan growth, including growth in newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates compared to the overall portfolio, • a $450 million lower benefit related to the residential real estate portfolio, as the current year reduction in the allowance for loan losses was lower than the prior year. The reduction in both periods reflected continued improvements in home prices and lower delinquencies and • a $150 million increase related to the auto and business banking portfolio, due to additions to the allowance for loan losses and higher net charge-offs, reflecting loan growth in the portfolios. The wholesale provision for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflecting the impact of downgrades in the Oil & Gas and Natural Gas Pipelines portfolios.

The Firm has a comprehensive country risk management framework for assessing country risks, determining risk tolerance, and measuring and monitoring direct country exposures in the Firm. The Country Risk Management group is responsible for developing guidelines and policies for managing country risk in both emerging and developed countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios giving rise to country risk to ensure the Firm’s country risk exposures are diversified and that exposure levels are appropriate given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Country risk organization The Country Risk Management group, part of the independent risk management function, works in close partnership with other risk functions to assess and monitor country risk within the Firm. The Firmwide Risk Executive for Country Risk reports to the Firm’s CRO. Country Risk Management is responsible for the following functions: • Developing guidelines and policies consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework • Assigning sovereign ratings and assessing country risks • Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm • Managing country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management • Developing surveillance tools for early identification of potential country risk concerns • Providing country risk scenario analysis Country risk identification and measurement The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, country exposure is reported based on the country where the majority of the assets of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor are located or where the majority of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (legal residence) or country of incorporation of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor. Country exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm’s risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain tranched credit derivatives. Different measurement approaches or assumptions would affect the amount of reported country exposure. Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework: • Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and cash and marketable securities collateral received • Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with central and commercial banks • Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of collateral received • Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions • Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the related collateral. Counterparty exposure on derivatives can change significantly because of market movements • Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is reported based on the underlying reference entity and is measured at the notional amount of protection purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized derivative receivable or payable. Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s market- making activities is measured on a net basis, as such activities often result in selling and purchasing protection related to the same underlying reference entity; this reflects the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures Some activities may create contingent or indirect exposure related to a country (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables). These exposures are managed in the normal course of business through the Firm’s credit, market, and operational risk governance, rather than through Country Risk Management. The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements. For further information on the FFIEC’s reporting methodology, see Cross-border outstandings on page 292. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 109 Country risk stress testing The country risk stress framework aims to estimate losses arising from a country crisis by capturing the impact of large asset price movements in a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically defines and runs ad hoc stress scenarios for individual countries in response to specific market events and sector performance concerns. Country risk monitoring and control The Country Risk Management group establishes guidelines for sovereign ratings reviews and limit management. Country stress and nominal exposures are measured under a comprehensive country limit framework. Country ratings and limits are actively monitored and reported on a regular basis. Country limit requirements are reviewed and approved by senior management as often as necessary, but at least annually. In addition, the Country Risk Management group uses surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns. Country risk reporting The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2016. The selection of countries is based solely on the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to Germany, Japan and Luxembourg since December 31, 2015 largely reflects higher Euro and Yen balances, predominantly placed on deposit at the central banks of these countries, driven by changing client positions and prevailing market and liquidity conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis 110 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Liquidity risk oversight The Firm has a liquidity risk oversight function whose primary objective is to provide assessment, measurement, monitoring, and control of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity risk oversight is managed through a dedicated firmwide Liquidity Risk Oversight group. The CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) CRO, who reports to the CRO, as part of the independent risk management function, has responsibility for firmwide Liquidity Risk Oversight. Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities include but are not limited to: • Establishing and monitoring limits, indicators, and thresholds, including liquidity appetite tolerances; • Defining, monitoring, and reporting internal firmwide and material legal entity liquidity stress tests, and monitoring and reporting regulatory defined liquidity stress testing; • Monitoring and reporting liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; • Conducting ad hoc analysis to identify potential emerging liquidity risks. Risk governance and measurement Specific committees responsible for liquidity governance include firmwide ALCO as well as line of business and regional ALCOs, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the DRPC reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy at least annually. For further discussion of ALCO and other risk- related committees, see Enterprise-wide Risk Management on pages 71–75. Internal Stress testing Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure the Firm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal entities on a regular basis and ad hoc stress tests are performed, as needed, in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s contractual obligations are met and take into consideration varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets, estimated non-contractual and contingent outflows and potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions. Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range of time horizons and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stress. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through stock and long-term debt issuances, and the IHC provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries, as necessary. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company and the IHC, in addition to liquidity held at the operating subsidiaries, at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, to manage through periods of stress where access to normal funding sources is disrupted. Liquidity management Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management. The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs, meet contractual and contingent obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and to manage an optimal funding mix, and availability of liquidity sources. The Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach across its entities, taking into consideration both their current liquidity profile and any potential changes over time, in order to optimize liquidity sources and uses. In the context of the Firm’s liquidity management, Treasury and CIO is responsible for: • Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the Firm, lines of business and legal entities’ assets and liabilities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions; • Defining and monitoring firmwide and legal entity- specific liquidity strategies, policies, guidelines, and contingency funding plans; • Managing liquidity within approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits; • Setting transfer pricing in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items. Contingency funding plan The Firm’s contingency funding plan (“CFP”), which is reviewed by ALCO and approved by the DRPC, is a compilation of procedures and action plans for managing liquidity through stress events. The CFP incorporates the limits and indicators set by the Liquidity Risk Oversight group. These limits and indicators are reviewed regularly to identify the emergence of risks or vulnerabilities in the Firm’s liquidity position. The CFP identifies the alternative contingent liquidity resources available to the Firm in a stress event. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 111 LCR and NSFR The U.S. LCR rule requires the Firm to measure the amount of HQLA held by the Firm in relation to estimated net cash outflows within a 30-day period during an acute stress event. The LCR was required to be 90% at January 1, 2016, increased to a minimum of 100% commencing January 1, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Firm was compliant with the Fully Phased-In U.S. LCR. On December 19, 2016 the Federal Reserve published final U.S. LCR public disclosure requirements for certain bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies. Starting with the second quarter of 2017, the Firm will be required to disclose quarterly its consolidated LCR pursuant to the U.S. LCR rule, including the Firm’s average LCR for the quarter and the key quantitative components of the average LCR in a standardized template, along with a qualitative discussion of material drivers of the ratio, changes over time, and causes of such changes. The Basel Committee final standard for the net stable funding ratio (“Basel NSFR”) is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. Basel NSFR will become a minimum standard by January 1, 2018 and requires that this ratio be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. On April 26, 2016, the U.S. NSFR proposal was released for large banks and bank holding companies and was largely consistent with Basel NSFR. The proposed requirement would apply beginning on January 1, 2018, consistent with the Basel NSFR timeline. The Firm estimates it was compliant with the proposed U.S. NSFR as of December 31, 2016 based on its current understanding of the proposed rule. HQLA HQLA is the amount of assets that qualify for inclusion in the U.S. LCR. HQLA primarily consists of cash and certain unencumbered high quality liquid assets as defined in the final rule. As of December 31, 2016, the Firm’s HQLA was $524 billion, compared with $496 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase in HQLA primarily reflects the impact of sales, maturities and paydowns in non-HQLA-eligible securities, as well as deposit growth in excess of loan growth. Certain of these actions resulted in increased excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. which is excluded from the Firm’s HQLA as required under the U.S. LCR rules. The Firm’s HQLA may fluctuate from period to period primarily due to normal flows from client activity. The following table presents the Firm’s estimated HQLA included in the U.S. LCR broken out by HQLA-eligible cash and securities as of December 31, 2016. December 31, (in billions) 2016 HQLA Eligible cash(a) $ 323 Eligible securities(b) 201 Total HQLA(c) $ 524 (a) Cash on deposit at central banks. (b) Predominantly includes U.S. agency MBS, U.S. Treasuries, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under U.S. LCR rules. (c) Excludes excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. As of December 31, 2016, in addition to HQLA reported above, the Firm had approximately $262 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. This includes HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firm also maintains borrowing capacity at various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”), the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2016, the Firm’s remaining borrowing capacity at various FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window was approximately $221 billion. This remaining borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities included in HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently held at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window, but for which the Firm has not drawn liquidity. Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm’s loan portfolio ($894.8 billion at December 31, 2016), is funded with a portion of the Firm’s deposits ($1,375.2 billion at December 31, 2016) and through securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm’s real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the FHLBs. Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets- Management’s discussion and analysis 112 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report debt and equity instruments are primarily funded by the Firm’s securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities–debt and equity instruments, and a portion of the Firm’s long-term debt and stockholders’ equity. In addition to funding securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments, proceeds from the Firm’s debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. See the discussion below for additional information relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance. Deposits The table below summarizes, by line of business, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Deposits Year ended December 31, As of or for the year ended December 31, Average (in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 Consumer & Community Banking $ 618,337 $ 557,645 $ 586,637 $ 530,938 Corporate & Investment Bank 412,434 395,228 409,680 414,064 Commercial Banking 179,532 172,470 172,835 184,132 Asset & Wealth Management 161,577 146,766 153,334 149,525 Corporate 3,299 7,606 5,482 17,129 Total Firm $ 1,375,179 $ 1,279,715 $ 1,327,968 $ 1,295,788 A key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits, which are considered a stable source of liquidity. Additionally, the majority of the Firm’s wholesale operating deposits are also considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The Firm’s loans-to-deposits ratio was 65% at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, total deposits for the Firm were $1,375.2 billion, compared with $1,279.7 billion at December 31, 2015 (61% of total liabilities at each of December 31, 2016 and 2015). The increase was attributable to higher consumer and wholesale deposits. The increase in consumer deposits reflected continuing strong growth from existing and new customers, and the impact of low attrition rates. The wholesale increase was driven by growth in operating deposits related to client activity in CIB’s Treasury Services business, and inflows in AWM primarily from business growth and the impact of new rules governing money market funds. The Firm believes average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends. The increase in average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, was predominantly driven by an increase in consumer deposits, partially offset by a reduction in wholesale non-operating deposits, driven by the Firm’s actions in 2015 to reduce such deposits. For further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of the Firm’s business segments results and the Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 51–70 and pages 43– 44, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis 114 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Short-term funding The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the average balance of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with the balance at December 31, 2015, was largely due to lower secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments in the CIB related to client-driven market-making activities. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities; the Firm’s demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors. Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC requirements. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. For additional information, see Note 21. Long-term unsecured funding Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Issuance Senior notes issued in the U.S. market $ 25,639 $ 19,212 Senior notes issued in non-U.S. markets 7,063 10,188 Total senior notes 32,702 29,400 Subordinated debt 1,093 3,210 Structured notes 22,865 22,165 Total long-term unsecured funding – issuance $ 56,660 $ 54,775 Maturities/redemptions Senior notes $ 29,989 $ 18,454 Trust preferred securities 1,630 1,500 Subordinated debt 3,596 6,908 Structured notes 15,925 18,099 Total long-term unsecured funding – maturities/redemptions $ 51,140 $ 44,961 The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and advances from the FHLBs. The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemption for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

(b) Includes long-term structured notes which are secured. The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, see Note 16. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 115 Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third- party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see SPEs on page 45, and credit risk, liquidity risk and credit- related contingent features in Note 6 on page 181. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and nonbank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, were as follows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Chase Bank USA, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC December 31, 2016 Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Moody’s Investors Service A3 P-2 Stable Aa3 P-1 Stable Aa3(a) P-1 Stable Standard & Poor’s A- A-2 Stable A+ A-1 Stable A+ A-1 Stable Fitch Ratings A+ F1 Stable AA- F1+ Stable AA- F1+ Stable (a) On February 22, 2017, Moody’s published its updated rating methodologies for securities firms. Subsequently, as a result of this action, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC’s long-term issuer rating was downgraded by one notch from Aa3 to A1. The short-term issuer rating was unchanged and the outlook remained stable. Downgrades of the Firm’s long-term ratings by one or two notches could result in an increase in its cost of funds, and access to certain funding markets could be reduced as noted above. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors (which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics). The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings. Although the Firm closely monitors and endeavors to manage, to the extent it is able, factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that its credit ratings will not be changed in the future. Management’s discussion and analysis 116 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Firm’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, implied volatilities or credit spreads. Market Risk Management Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. The Market Risk Management function reports to the Firm’s CRO. Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions: • Establishment of a market risk policy framework • Independent measurement, monitoring and control of line of business and firmwide market risk • Definition, approval and monitoring of limits • Performance of stress testing and qualitative risk assessments Risk measurement Tools used to measure risk Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, the Firm uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including: • VaR • Economic-value stress testing • Nonstatistical risk measures • Loss advisories • Profit and loss drawdowns • Earnings-at-risk • Other sensitivities Risk monitoring and control Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, the Firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity and accommodation of client business and management experience. The Firm maintains different levels of limits. Corporate level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, line of business limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by loss advisories, nonstatistical measurements and profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the lines of business, as well at the portfolio or legal entity level. Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate, with any changes approved by line of business management and Market Risk Management. Senior management, including the Firm’s CEO and CRO, are responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. All limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are escalated to senior management. The lines of business are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with Firm senior management and the line of business senior management to determine the appropriate course of action required to return to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach. Certain Firm or line of business-level limits that have been breached for three business days or longer, or by more than 30%, are escalated to senior management and the Firmwide Risk Committee. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 117 The following table summarizes by line of business the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk, and the primary market risk management tools utilized to manage those risks. Risk identification and classification by line of business Line of Business Predominant business activities and related market risks Positions included in Risk Management VaR Positions included in earnings-at-risk Positions included in other sensitivity-based measurements CCB • Services mortgage loans which give rise to complex, non-linear interest rate and basis risk • Non-linear risk arises primarily from prepayment options embedded in mortgages and changes in the probability of newly originated mortgage commitments actually closing • Basis risk results from differences in the relative movements of the rate indices underlying mortgage exposure and other interest rates • Originates loans and takes deposits • Mortgage pipeline loans, classified as derivatives • Warehouse loans, classified as trading assets – debt instruments • MSRs • Hedges of pipeline loans, warehouse loans and MSRs, classified as derivatives • Interest-only securities, classified as trading assets - debt instruments, and related hedges, classified as derivatives • Marketable equity investments measured at fair value through earnings • Retained loan portfolio • Deposits CIB • Makes markets and services clients across fixed income, foreign exchange, equities and commodities • Market risk arises from changes in market prices (e.g., rates and credit spreads) resulting in a potential decline in net income • Trading assets/liabilities – debt and marketable equity instruments, and derivatives, including hedges of the retained loan portfolio • Certain securities purchased, loaned or sold under resale agreements and securities borrowed • Fair value option elected liabilities • Derivative CVA and associated hedges • Retained loan portfolio • Deposits • Private-equity investments measured at fair value • Derivatives DVA/FVA and fair value option elected liabilities DVA CB • Engages in traditional wholesale banking activities which include extensions of loans and credit facilities and taking deposits • Risk arises from changes in interest rates and prepayment risk with potential for adverse impact on net interest income and interest-rate sensitive fees • Retained loan portfolio • Deposits AWM • Provides initial capital investments in products such as mutual funds, which give rise to market risk arising from changes in market prices in such products • Debt securities held in advance of distribution to clients, classified as trading assets - debt and equity instruments • Retained loan portfolio • Deposits • Initial seed capital investments and related hedges, classified as derivatives • Capital invested alongside third- party investors, typically in privately distributed collective vehicles managed by AWM (i.e., co-investments) Corporate • Manages the Firm’s liquidity, funding, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks arising from activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business segments • Derivative positions measured at fair value through noninterest revenue in earnings • Marketable equity investments measured at fair value through earnings • Investment securities portfolio and related interest rate hedges • Deposits • Long-term debt and related interest rate hedges • Private equity investments measured at fair value • Foreign exchange exposure related to Firm-issued non-USD long-term debt (“LTD”) and related hedges As part of the Firm’s evaluation and periodic enhancement of its market risk measures, during the third quarter of 2016 the Firm refined the scope of positions included in risk management VaR. In particular, certain private equity positions in the CIB, exposure arising from non-U.S. dollar denominated funding activities in Corporate, as well as seed capital investments in AWM were removed from the VaR calculation. Commencing with the third quarter of 2016, exposure arising from these positions is captured using other sensitivity-based measures, such as a 10% decline in market value or a 1 basis point parallel shift in spreads, as appropriate. For more information, see Other sensitivity-based measures at page 123. The Firm believes this refinement to its reported VaR measures more appropriately captures the risk of its market risk sensitive instruments. This change did not impact Regulatory VaR as these positions are not included in the calculation of Regulatory VaR. Regulatory VaR is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. Management’s discussion and analysis 118 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. The framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a stable measure of VaR that is closely aligned to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business, and provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events on a daily basis. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. Those VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR “back-testing exceptions,” defined as losses greater than that predicted by VaR estimates, on average five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR back-testing exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of back-testing exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual products and/or risk factors. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level. Since VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential losses, and it is not used to estimate the impact of stressed market conditions or to manage any impact from potential stress events. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other measures such as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions. The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ (see Valuation process in Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s valuation process). Because VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. For information regarding model reviews and approvals, see Model Risk Management on page 128. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 119 For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g. VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting), see JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at: (http:// investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm). The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. Total VaR As of or for the year ended December 31, 2016 2015 At December 31, (in millions) Avg. Min Max Avg.

The diversification effect reflects the fact that risks are not perfectly correlated. (b) Designated as NM, because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for distinct risk components, and hence it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio-diversification effect. As discussed on page 117, during the third quarter of 2016 the Firm refined the scope of positions included in Risk Management VaR. In the absence of these refinements, the average VaR, without diversification, for each of the following reported components would have been higher by the following amounts for the full year 2016: CIB Equities VaR by $3 million; CIB trading VaR by $2 million; CIB VaR by $3 million; Corporate VaR by $4 million; AWM VaR by $2 million; Other VaR by $4 million; and Total VaR by $3 million. Additionally, the Total VaR at December 31, 2016 would have been higher by $7 million in the absence of these refinements. Average Total VaR decreased $2 million for the full year ending December 31, 2016 as compared with the respective prior year period. The reduction in average Total VaR is due to the aforementioned scope changes as well as a lower risk profile in the Equities risk type. This was offset by changes in the risk profiles of the Foreign exchange and Fixed Income risk types. Additionally, average Credit portfolio VaR declined as a result of lower exposures arising from select positions. The Firm’s average Total VaR diversification benefit was $8 million or 18% of the sum for 2016, compared with $10 million or 21% of the sum for 2015. The Firm continues to enhance its VaR model calculations and the time series inputs related to certain asset-backed products. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change. VaR back-testing The Firm evaluates the effectiveness of its VaR methodology by back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses recognized on market-risk related revenue. The Firm’s definition of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition market risk- related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments (e.g., liquidity and DVA), net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading. Management’s discussion and analysis 120 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following chart compares the daily market risk-related gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the year ended December 31, 2016. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of back-testing disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to covered positions. The chart shows that for the year ended December 31, 2016 the Firm observed 5 VaR back-testing exceptions and posted Market-risk related gains on 151 of the 260 days in this period. Daily Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses vs. Risk Management VaR (1-day, 95% Confidence level) Year ended December 31, 2016 Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses Risk Management VaR First Quarter 2016 Second Quarter 2016 Third Quarter 2016 Fourth Quarter 2016 For the year ended December 31, 2016, there were 5 back-testing exceptions. The two exceptions that occurred towards the end of June 2016, subsequent to the U.K. referendum on membership in the European Union, reflect the elevated market volatility observed across multiple asset classes following the outcome of the vote. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 121 Other risk measures Economic-value stress testing Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool in measuring and controlling risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior as an indicator of losses, stress testing is intended to capture the Firm’s exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. The Firm runs weekly stress tests on market-related risks across the lines of business using multiple scenarios that assume significant changes in risk factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. The Firm uses a number of standard scenarios that capture different risk factors across asset classes including geographical factors, specific idiosyncratic factors and extreme tail events. The stress framework calculates multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs for each risk factor and combines them in multiple ways to capture different market scenarios. For example, certain scenarios assess the potential loss arising from current exposures held by the Firm due to a broad sell off in bond markets or an extreme widening in corporate credit spreads. The flexibility of the stress testing framework allows risk managers to construct new, specific scenarios that can be used to form decisions about future possible stress events. Stress testing complements VaR by allowing risk managers to shock current market prices to more extreme levels relative to those historically realized, and to stress test the relationships between market prices under extreme scenarios. Stress scenarios are defined and reviewed by Market Risk Management, and significant changes are reviewed by the relevant LOB Risk Committees and may be redefined on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions. Stress-test results, trends and qualitative explanations based on current market risk positions are reported to the respective LOBs and the Firm’s senior management to allow them to better understand the sensitivity of positions to certain defined events and to enable them to manage their risks with more transparency. Results are also reported to the Board of Directors. The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results under scenarios mandated by the Federal Reserve’s CCAR and ICAAP processes. In addition, the results are incorporated into the quarterly assessment of the Firm’s Risk Appetite Framework and are also presented to the DRPC. Nonstatistical risk measures Nonstatistical risk measures include sensitivities to variables used to value positions, such as credit spread sensitivities, interest rate basis point values and market values. These measures provide granular information on the Firm’s market risk exposure. They are aggregated by line of business and by risk type, and are also used for monitoring internal market risk limits. Loss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns Loss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns are tools used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. Profit and loss drawdowns are defined as the decline in net profit and loss since the year-to-date peak revenue level. Earnings-at-risk The VaR and sensitivity measures described above illustrate the economic sensitivity of the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. The Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk exposure through earnings-at-risk, which measures the extent to which changes in interest rates will affect the Firm’s net interest income and certain interest rate-sensitive fees. For a summary by line of business, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk, see the table on page 117. The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest rate risk policies and market risk limits, which are subject to approval by the DRPC. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the lines of business, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management including the CTC Risk Committee and the Firm’s ALCO. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors, including: • Differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments • Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off- balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time • Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve) • The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change Management’s discussion and analysis 122 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through a transfer-pricing system, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. All transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed. The Firm generates a baseline for net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees, and then conducts simulations of changes for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollar and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios consider the impact on exposures as a result of changes in interest rates from baseline rates, as well as pricing sensitivities of deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on scenario interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. The non-U.S. dollar sensitivity scenarios are not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2016 and 2015. JPMorgan Chase’s 12-month earnings-at-risk sensitivity profiles U.S. dollar Instantaneous change in rates (in billions) +200 bps +100 bps -100 bps -200 bps December 31, 2016 $ 4.0 $ 2.4 NM (a) NM (a) December 31, 2015 $ 5.2 $ 3.1 NM (a) NM (a) (a) Given the current level of market interest rates, downward parallel 100 and 200 basis point earnings-at-risk scenarios are not considered to be meaningful. The Firm’s benefit to rising rates on U.S. dollar assets and liabilities is largely a result of reinvesting at higher yields and assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits. The Firm’s net U.S. dollar sensitivity to a 200 bps and 100 bps instantaneous increase in rates decreased by approximately $1.2 billion and $700 million, respectively, when compared to December 31, 2015. The primary driver of that decrease was the updating of the Firm’s baseline to reflect higher interest rates. As higher interest rates are reflected in the Firm’s baselines, the magnitude of the sensitivity to further increases in rates would be expected to be less significant. The net change in mix in the Firm’s spot and forecasted balance sheet also contributed to a decrease in the net U.S. dollar sensitivity when compared to December 31, 2015. Separately, another U.S. dollar interest rate scenario used by the Firm — involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels — results in a 12-month benefit to net interest income of approximately $800 million. The increase under this scenario reflects the Firm reinvesting at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged. The result of the comparable non-U.S. dollar scenario was not material to the Firm. Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the lines of business, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives within risk limits governed by the CTC Risk Committee. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 123 Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and OCI due to changes in relevant market variables. For additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures, please refer to the Risk identification and classification table on page 117. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2016, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration in these sensitivities.

Management’s discussion and analysis 124 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report PRINCIPAL RISK MANAGEMENT Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial assets and instruments, typically representing ownership or junior capital positions, that have unique risks due to their illiquidity or for which there is less observable market or valuation data. Such positions are typically intended to be held over extended investment periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term gain with respect to these investments. Principal investments cover multiple asset classes and are made either in stand- alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. Asset classes include tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments), private equity and various debt investments. Increasingly, new principal investment activity seeks to enhance or accelerate line of business strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed under various lines of business and are reflected within the respective LOBs financial results. The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm’s general risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk policy framework exists for all principal investing activities. All investments are approved by investment committees that include executives who are independent from the investing businesses. The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of principal investments in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for such investments are established for each relevant business in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. Industry, geographic and position level concentration limits are in place and are intended to ensure diversification of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 125 COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT Compliance risk is the risk of failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Overview Each line of business is accountable for managing its compliance risk. The Firm’s Compliance Organization (“Compliance”), which is independent of the lines of business, works closely with senior management to provide independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations applicable to the offering of the Firm’s products and services to clients and customers. These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of legal and regulatory obligations, depending on the line of business and the jurisdiction, and include those related to products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the rules and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders, among others. Other Functions such as Finance (including Tax), Technology and Human Resources provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility. Compliance implements various practices designed to identify and mitigate compliance risk by establishing policies, testing, monitoring, training and providing guidance. In recent years, the Firm has experienced heightened scrutiny by its regulators of its compliance with regulations, and with respect to its controls and operational processes. In certain instances, the Firm has entered into Consent Orders with its regulators requiring the Firm to take certain specified actions to remediate compliance with regulations and improve its controls. The Firm expects that such regulatory scrutiny will continue. Governance and oversight Compliance is led by the Firms’ CCO who reports, effective September 2016, to the Firm’s CRO. The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its Compliance Risk Management practices through the Firm’s CCO, lines of business CCOs and regional CCOs to implement the Compliance program globally across the lines of business and regions. The Firm’s CCO is a member of the FCC and the FRC. The Firm’s CCO also provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and DRPC. In addition, from time to time, special committees of the Board have been established to oversee the Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders. The Firm has in place a Code of Conduct (the “Code”), and each employee is given annual training in respect of the Code and is required annually to affirm his or her compliance with the Code. The Code sets forth the Firm’s core principles and fundamental values, including that no employee should ever sacrifice integrity - or give the impression that he or she has. The Code requires prompt reporting of any known or suspected violation of the Code, any internal Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires the reporting of any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. Specified employees are specially trained and designated as “code specialists” who act as a resource to employees on Code matters. In addition, concerns may be reported anonymously and the Firm prohibits retaliation against employees for the good faith reporting of any actual or suspected violations of the Code. The Code and the associated employee compliance program are focused on the regular assessment of certain key aspects of the Firm’s culture and conduct initiatives. 126 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT Conduct risk is the risk that an employee’s action or inaction causes undue harm to the Firm’s clients and customers, damages market integrity, undermines the Firm’s reputation, or negatively impacts the Firm’s culture. Overview Each line of business or function is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (“Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides certain information and the resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in compliance with the law everywhere the Firm operates. For further discussion of the Code, see Compliance Risk Management on page 125. Governance and oversight The CMDC is the primary Board-level Committee that oversees the Firm’s culture and conduct programs. The Audit Committee has responsibility to review the program established by management that monitors compliance with the Code. Additionally, the DRPC reviews, at least annually, the Firm’s qualitative factors included in the Risk Appetite Framework, including conduct risk. The DRPC also meets annually with the CMDC to review and discuss aspects of the Firm’s compensation practices. Conduct risk management is incorporated into various aspects of people management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and compensation processes. Businesses undertake annual Risk and Control Self-Assessment (“RCSA”) assessments; and, as part of these RCSA reviews, they identify their respective key inherent operational risks (including conduct risks), evaluate the design and effectiveness of their controls, identify control gaps and develop associated action plans. The Firm’s Know Your Employee framework generally addresses how the Firm manages, oversees and responds to workforce conduct related matters that may otherwise expose the Firm to financial, reputational, compliance and other operating risks. The Firm also has a HR Control Forum, the primary purpose of which is to discuss conduct and accountability for more significant risk and control issues and review, when appropriate, employee actions including but not limited to promotion and compensation actions. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 127 LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT Legal risk is the risk of loss or imposition of damages, fines, penalties or other liability arising from the failure to comply with a contractual obligation or to comply with laws, rules or regulations to which the Firm is subject. Overview In addition to providing legal services and advice to the Firm, and communicating and helping the lines of business adjust to the legal and regulatory changes they face, including the heightened scrutiny and expectations of the Firm’s regulators, the global Legal function is responsible for working with the businesses and corporate functions to fully understand and assess their adherence to laws, rules and regulations. In particular, Legal assists Oversight & Control, Risk, Finance, Compliance and Internal Audit in their efforts to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and the Firm’s corporate standards for doing business. The Firm’s lawyers also advise the Firm on potential legal exposures on key litigation and transactional matters, and perform a significant defense and advocacy role by defending the Firm against claims and potential claims and, when needed, pursuing claims against others. In addition, they advise the Firm’s Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. Governance and oversight The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the FCC. The General Counsel’s leadership team includes a General Counsel for each line of business, the heads of the Litigation and Corporate & Regulatory practices, as well as the Firm’s Corporate Secretary. Each region (e.g., Latin America, Asia Pacific) has a General Counsel who is responsible for managing legal risk across all lines of business and functions in the region. Legal works with various committees (including new business initiative and reputation risk committees) and the Firm’s businesses to protect the Firm’s reputation beyond any particular legal requirements. 128 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. The Firm uses models across various businesses and functions. The models are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes including, for example, the valuation of positions and the measurement of risk, such as assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, and making business decisions. Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the various businesses and functions in the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to the Model Risk function for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities. The Model Risk function reviews and approves a wide range of models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models used by the Firm. The Model Risk function is independent of model users and developers. The Firmwide Model Risk Executive reports to the Firm’s CRO. Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of the Model Risk function. A model review conducted by the Model Risk function considers the model’s suitability for the specific uses to which it will be put. The factors considered in reviewing a model include whether the model accurately reflects the characteristics of the product and its significant risks, the selection and reliability of model inputs, consistency with models for similar products, the appropriateness of any model-related adjustments, and sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions that cannot be observed from the market. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within the Model Risk function based on the relevant model tier. Under the Firm’s Model Risk Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances, the head of the Model Risk function may grant exceptions to the Firm’s model risk policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. For a summary of valuations based on models, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 132–134 and Note 3. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 129 OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events that are neither market- nor credit-related. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm. The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates. Operational Risk Management Framework To monitor and control operational risk, the Firm has an Operational Risk Management Framework which is designed to enable the Firm to maintain a sound and well-controlled operational environment. The ORMF is comprised of four main components: Governance, Risk Assessment, Measurement, and Monitoring and Reporting. Governance The lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for owning and managing their operational risks. The Firmwide Oversight and Control Group, which consists of control officers within each line of business and corporate function, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the ORMF. Line of business and corporate function control committees oversee the operational risk and control environments of their respective businesses and functions. These committees escalate operational risk issues to the FCC, as appropriate. For additional information on the FCC, see Enterprise Risk Management on pages 71–75. The Firmwide Risk Executive for Operational Risk Governance (“ORG”), a direct report to the CRO, is responsible for defining the ORMF and establishing minimum standards for its execution. Operational Risk Officers report to both the line of business CROs and to the Firmwide Risk Executive for ORG, and are independent of the respective businesses or corporate functions they oversee. The Firm’s Operational Risk Appetite Policy is approved by the DRPC. This policy establishes the Operational Risk Management Framework for the Firm. The assessments of operational risk using this framework are reviewed with the DRPC. Risk assessment The Firm utilizes several tools to identify, assess, mitigate and manage its operational risk. One such tool is the RCSA program which is executed by LOBs and corporate functions in accordance with the minimum standards established by ORG. As part of the RCSA program, lines of business and corporate functions identify key operational risks inherent in their activities, evaluate the effectiveness of relevant controls in place to mitigate identified risks, and define actions to reduce residual risk. Action plans are developed for identified control issues and businesses are held accountable for tracking and resolving issues in a timely manner. Operational Risk Officers independently challenge the execution of the RCSA program and evaluate the appropriateness of the residual risk results. In addition to the RCSA program, the Firm tracks and monitors events that have or could lead to actual operational risk losses, including litigation-related events. Responsible businesses and corporate functions analyze their losses to evaluate the efficacy of their control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where targeted remediation efforts may be required. ORG provides oversight of these activities and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk. Measurement In addition to the level of actual operational risk losses, operational risk measurement includes operational risk- based capital and operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced. As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach, incorporates internal and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and ICAAP processes. For information related to operational risk RWA, CCAR or ICAAP, see Capital Risk Management section, pages 76–85. Management’s discussion and analysis 130 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Monitoring and reporting ORG has established standards for consistent operational risk reporting. The standards also reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors. Operational risk reports are produced on a firmwide basis as well as by line of business and corporate function. Other operational risks As mentioned previously, operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Risks such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk and Model risk as well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement processes. More information on Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk and Model risk are discussed on pages 125, 126, 127 and 128, respectively. Details on other select operational risks are provided below. Cybersecurity risk The Firm devotes significant resources to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are intended to protect against cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients can also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. However, where cybersecurity incidents are due to client failure to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients will generally be responsible for losses incurred. To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm leverages the ORMF to ensure risks are identified and managed within defined corporate tolerances. The Firm’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee are regularly briefed on the Firm’s cybersecurity policies and practices as well as its efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. Payment fraud risk Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal benefit at the expense of the Firm. Over the past year, the risk of payment fraud has increased across the industry, with the number of attempts hitting record highs. The complexities of these attacks along with perpetrators’ strategies continue to evolve. A Payments Control Program has been established that includes Cybersecurity, Operations, Technology, Risk and the lines of business to manage the risk, implement controls and provide client education and awareness training. The program monitors and measures payment fraud activity, evaluates the Firm’s cybersecurity defenses, limits access to sensitive data, and provides training to both employees and clients. Third-party outsourcing risk To identify and manage the operational risk inherent in its outsourcing activities, the Firm has a Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) framework to assist lines of business and corporate functions in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships. The objective of the TPO framework is to hold third parties to the same high level of operational performance as is expected of the Firm’s internal operations. The Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide TPO training, monitoring, reporting and standards. Business and technology resilience risk Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, flooding, transit strikes, terrorist threats or infectious disease. The safety of the Firm’s employees and customers is of the highest priority. The Firm’s global resiliency program is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption. The program includes corporate governance, awareness and training, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of the Firm’s global resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and quickly after various events. Insurance One of the ways operational loss may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance to be in compliance with local laws and regulations (e.g., workers compensation), as well as to serve other needs (e.g., property loss and public liability). Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business. The insurance purchased is reviewed and approved by senior management. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 131 REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT Reputation risk is the risk that an action, transaction, investment or event will reduce trust in the Firm’s integrity or competence by its various constituents, including clients, counterparties, investors, regulators, employees and the broader public. Maintaining the Firm’s reputation is the responsibility of each individual employee of the Firm. The Firm’s Reputation Risk Governance policy explicitly vests each employee with the responsibility to consider the reputation of the Firm when engaging in any activity. Since the types of events that could harm the Firm’s reputation are so varied across the Firm’s lines of business, each line of business has a separate reputation risk governance infrastructure in place, which consists of three key elements: clear, documented escalation criteria appropriate to the business; a designated primary discussion forum — in most cases, one or more dedicated reputation risk committees; and a list of designated contacts, to whom questions relating to reputation risk should be referred. Line of business reputation risk governance is overseen by a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance function which provides oversight of the governance infrastructure and process to support the consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of reputation risk issues firmwide. Management’s discussion and analysis 132 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending- related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. For further discussion of these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, see Note 15. Allowance for credit losses sensitivity The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. The use of alternate estimates, data sources, adjustments to modeled loss estimates for model imprecision and other factors would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses. To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of December 31, 2016, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses: • For PCI loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $600 million. • For the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, a combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual loss estimates of approximately $125 million. • For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual loss estimates of approximately $900 million. • An increase in PD factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled loss estimates of approximately $2.3 billion. • A 100 basis point increase in estimated LGD for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $175 million. The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 133 follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventory JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, see Note 3. December 31, 2016 (in billions, except ratio data) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Trading debt and equity instruments $ 308.0 $ 7.9 Derivative receivables(a) 64.1 5.8 Trading assets 372.1 13.7 AFS securities 238.9 0.7 Loans 2.2 0.6 MSRs 6.1 6.1 Private equity investments(b) 1.7 1.6 Other 26.4 0.5 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis 647.4 23.2 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 1.6 0.8 Total assets measured at fair value $ 649.0 $ 24.0 Total Firm assets $ 2,491.0 Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 1.0% Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 3.7% (a) For purposes of table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $5.8 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. (b) Private equity instruments represent investments within Corporate. Valuation Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 3. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. For further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, see Note 3. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm see Note 3. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3. Goodwill impairment Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 17. Management applies significant judgment when estimating the fair value of its reporting units. Estimates of fair value are dependent upon estimates of (a) the future earnings potential of the Firm’s reporting units, including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, (b) long-term growth rates and (c) the estimated market cost of equity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Based upon the updated valuations for all of its reporting units, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired at December 31, 2016. The fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 10% - 130% for all Management’s discussion and analysis 134 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report reporting units and did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations. The projections for all of the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with management’s current short-term business outlook assumptions, and in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term growth and returns on equity of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. For additional information on goodwill, see Note 17. Income taxes JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional reserves as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting period. The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain NOLs and tax credits. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also incorporates various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2016, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance. JPMorgan Chase does not record U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent management has determined such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. Changes to the income tax rates applicable to these non-U.S. subsidiaries may have a material impact on the effective tax rate in a future period if such changes were to occur. The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when additional information becomes available. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 26. Litigation reserves For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, see Note 31. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 135 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards adopted during 2016 Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Amendments to the consolidation analysis • Eliminates the deferral issued by the FASB in February 2010 of VIE-related accounting requirements for certain investment funds, including mutual funds, private equity funds and hedge funds. • Amends the evaluation of fees paid to a decision-maker or a service provider, and exempts certain money market funds from consolidation. • Adopted January 1, 2016. • There was no material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. • For further information, see Note 1. Improvements to employee share-based payment accounting • Requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that pertain to employee stock-based incentive payments be recognized within income tax expense in the Consolidated statements of income, rather than within additional paid-in capital. • Adopted January 1, 2016. • There was no material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Measuring the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity • Provides an alternative for consolidated financing VIEs to elect: (1) to measure their financial assets and liabilities separately under existing U.S. GAAP for fair value measurement with any differences in such fair values reflected in earnings; or (2) to measure both their financial assets and liabilities using the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities. • Adopted January 1, 2016. • There was no material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements as the Firm has historically measured the financial assets and liabilities using the more observable fair value. Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities – DVA to OCI • For financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected, the portion of the total change in fair value caused by changes in the Firm’s own credit risk (i.e., DVA) is required to be presented separately in OCI. • Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. • Adopted January 1, 2016. • There was no material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. • For additional information about the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance, see Notes 3, 4 and 25. Management’s discussion and analysis 136 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report FASB Standards issued but not yet adopted Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Revenue recognition – revenue from contracts with customers Issued May 2014 • Requires that revenue from contracts with customers be recognized upon transfer of control of a good or service in the amount of consideration expected to be received. • Changes the accounting for certain contract costs, including whether they may be offset against revenue in the Consolidated statements of income, and requires additional disclosures about revenue and contract costs. • May be adopted using a full retrospective approach or a modified, cumulative effect approach wherein the guidance is applied only to existing contracts as of the date of initial application, and to new contracts transacted after that date. • Required effective date: January 1, 2018.(a) • Because the guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities that are accounted for under other U.S. GAAP, the Firm does not expect the new revenue recognition guidance to have a material impact on the elements of its Consolidated statements of income most closely associated with financial instruments, including securities gains, interest income and interest expense. • The Firm plans to adopt the revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018. The Firm’s implementation efforts include the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance, as well as the evaluation of revenue contracts and related accounting policies. While the Firm has not yet identified any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition, the Firm’s review is ongoing, and it continues to evaluate the presentation of certain contract costs (whether presented gross or offset against noninterest revenue). Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Issued January 2016 • Requires that certain equity instruments be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. • Generally requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. • Required effective date: January 1, 2018. • The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm’s implementation efforts include the identification of securities within the scope of the guidance, the evaluation of the measurement alternative available for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, and the related impact to accounting policies, presentation, and disclosures. Leases Issued February 2016 • Requires lessees to recognize all leases longer than twelve months on the Consolidated balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. • Requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” classification tests. • Expands qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding leasing arrangements. • Requires adoption using a modified cumulative effect approach wherein the guidance is applied to all periods presented. • Required effective date: January 1, 2019.(a) • The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements by reviewing its existing lease contracts and service contracts that may include embedded leases. The Firm expects to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets (at their present value) related to predominantly all of the $10 billion of future minimum payments required under operating leases as disclosed in Note 30. However, the population of contracts subject to balance sheet recognition and their initial measurement remains under evaluation. The Firm does not expect material changes to the recognition of operating lease expense in its Consolidated statements of income. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 137 FASB Standards issued but not yet adopted (continued) Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Financial instruments - credit losses Issued June 2016 • Replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost (including HTM securities), which will reflect management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the financial assets. • Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. • Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of impairment losses in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. • Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(b) • The Firm has begun its implementation efforts by establishing a firmwide, cross-discipline governance structure. The Firm is currently identifying key interpretive issues, and is assessing existing credit loss forecasting models and processes against the new guidance to determine what modifications may be required. • The Firm expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in its allowance for credit losses due to several factors, including: 1. The allowance related to the Firm’s loans and commitments will increase to cover credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio, and will consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions 2. The nonaccretable difference on PCI loans will be recognized as an allowance, offset by an increase in the carrying value of the related loans 3. An allowance will be established for estimated credit losses on HTM securities • The extent of the increase is under evaluation, but will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Firm’s portfolio at the adoption date, and the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date. Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows Issued August 2016 • Provides targeted amendments to the classification of certain cash flows, including treatment of cash payments for settlement of zero- coupon debt instruments and distributions received from equity method investments. • Requires retrospective application to all periods presented. • Required effective date: January 1, 2018.(a) • The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Treatment of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows Issued November 2016 • Requires inclusion of restricted cash in the cash and cash equivalents balances in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. • Requires additional disclosures to supplement the Consolidated statements of cash flows. • Requires retrospective application to all periods presented. • Required effective date: January 1, 2018.(a) • The Firm is currently evaluating the potential impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Definition of a business Issued January 2017 • Narrows the definition of a business and clarifies that, to be considered a business, the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) may not be substantially all concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets. • In addition, in order to be considered a business, a set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. • Required effective date: January 1, 2018.(a) • No material impact is expected because the guidance is to be applied prospectively, although it is anticipated that after adoption, fewer transactions will be treated as acquisitions or dispositions of a business. Goodwill Issued January 2017 • Requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. • Eliminates the second condition in the current guidance that requires an impairment loss to be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • Based on current impairment test results, the Firm does not expect a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. • After adoption, the guidance may result in more frequent goodwill impairment losses due to the removal of the second condition. (a) Early adoption is permitted. (b) Early adoption is permitted on January 1, 2019.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 139 Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making the assessment, management used the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2016, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marianne Lake Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 28, 2017 Report of independent registered public accounting firm 140 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Firm’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting”. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 146 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, see Note 33. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Effective January 1, 2016, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to the consolidation of legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures. The guidance eliminated the deferral issued by the FASB in February 2010 of the accounting guidance for VIEs for certain investment funds, including mutual funds, private equity funds and hedge funds. In addition, the guidance amends the evaluation of fees paid to a decision-maker or a service provider, and exempts certain money market funds from consolidation. Furthermore, asset management funds structured as limited partnerships or certain limited liability companies are now evaluated for consolidation as voting interest entities if the non-managing partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights) based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates if it is the general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant variable interest. There was no material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption of this accounting guidance. Voting Interest Entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in other income. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these funds. In the limited cases where the nonaffiliated partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm consolidates the funds. The Firm’s investment companies have investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets. Variable Interest Entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 147 The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in OCI within stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivatives transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single contract with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that contract to be terminated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due after expiration of any grace period). Upon the exercise of termination rights by the non- defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive value or “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative value or “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of repurchase agreement and securities loan default rights in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Notes to consolidated financial statements 148 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets (e.g., certain mortgage, home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral), liabilities and unfunded lending- related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on models that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use as inputs observable or unobservable market parameters, including but not limited to yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below. The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s VCG, which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. The VGF is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk- taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (see below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are applied and determined based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid- offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size. • Unobservable parameter valuation adjustments may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot Notes to consolidated financial statements 150 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Unobservable parameter valuation adjustments are applied to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. For more information on such adjustments see Credit and funding adjustments on page 164 of this Note. Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction data such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs to those models. The Model Risk function reviews and approves a wide range of models, including risk management, valuation, and regulatory capital models used by the Firm. The Model Risk function is independent of model users and developers. The Firmwide Model Risk Executive reports to the Firm’s CRO. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology, and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. The Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances, the head of the Model Risk function may grant exceptions to the Firm’s model risk policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. Valuation hierarchy A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 151 The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Securities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2 • Derivative features: for further information refer to the discussion of derivatives below. • Market rates for the respective maturity • Collateral Loans and lending-related commitments — wholesale Loans carried at fair value (e.g. trading loans and non-trading loans) Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent) • Relevant broker quotes • Observed market prices for similar instruments Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following: • Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating • Prepayment speed Loans held for investment and associated lending-related commitments Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 3 • Credit spreads, derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating • Prepayment speed Lending-related commitments are valued similar to loans and reflect the portion of an unused commitment expected, based on the Firm’s average portfolio historical experience, to become funded prior to an obligor default For information regarding the valuation of loans measured at collateral value, see Note 14. Loans — consumer Held for investment consumer loans, excluding credit card Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 3 • Credit losses – which consider expected and current default rates, and loss severity • Prepayment speed • Discount rates • Servicing costs For information regarding the valuation of loans measured at collateral value, see Note 14. Held for investment credit card receivables Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Level 3 • Credit costs - the allowance for loan losses is considered a reasonable proxy for the credit cost • Projected interest income, late-fee revenue and loan repayment rates • Discount rates • Servicing costs Trading loans — conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold Fair value is based on observable prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity. Predominantly level 2 Notes to consolidated financial statements 152 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Product/instrument Valuation methodology, inputs and assumptions Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Investment and trading securities Quoted market prices are used where available. Level 1 In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observable market prices for similar securities • Relevant broker quotes • Discounted cash flows In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products: Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity • Credit spreads • Credit rating data Physical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data Predominantly level 1 and 2 Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives that are actively traded and valued using the exchange price. Level 1 Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models, that use observable or unobservable valuation inputs (e.g., plain vanilla options and interest rate and CDS). Inputs include: Level 2 or 3 • Contractual terms including the period to maturity • Readily observable parameters including interest rates and volatility • Credit quality of the counterparty and of the Firm • Market funding levels • Correlation levels In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows: Structured credit derivatives specific inputs include: • CDS spreads and recovery rates • Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments (levels are modeled on a transaction basis and calibrated to liquid benchmark tranche indices) • Actual transactions, where available, are used to regularly recalibrate unobservable parameters Certain long-dated equity option specific inputs include: • Long-dated equity volatilities Certain interest rate and FX exotic options specific inputs include: • Interest rate correlation • Interest rate spread volatility • Foreign exchange correlation • Correlation between interest rates and foreign exchange rates • Parameters describing the evolution of underlying interest rates Certain commodity derivatives specific inputs include: • Commodity volatility • Forward commodity price Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA), and the impact of funding (FVA). See pages 164-165 of this Note. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 153 Product/instrument Valuation methodology, inputs and assumptions Classification in the valuation hierarchy Mortgage servicing rights See Mortgage servicing rights in Note 17. Level 3 Private equity direct investments Private equity direct investments Level 2 or 3 Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of potential inputs include: • Transaction prices • Trading multiples of comparable public companies • Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company • Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are not identical to the company being valued, and for company- specific issues and lack of liquidity • Additional available inputs relevant to the investment Fund investments (e.g. mutual/ collective investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and real estate funds) Net asset value • NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV level. Level 1 • Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption (e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where observable activity is limited Level 2 or 3(a) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs Valued using observable market information, where available Level 2 or 3 In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE Long-term debt, not carried at fair value Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2 • Market rates for respective maturity Structured notes (included in deposits, other borrowed funds and long-term debt) • Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note. • The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and to incorporate the impact of funding (FVA). See pages 164-165 of this Note. Level 2 or 3 (a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.

Report (a) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $80.6 billion and $67.0 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related. (b) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, included within trading loans were $16.5 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $11.0 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, market approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, see Note 6. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. (f) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Included in the balances at December 31, 2016 and 2015, were trading assets of $52 million and $61 million, respectively, and other assets of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. (g) Private equity instruments represent investments within Corporate. The portion of the private equity investment portfolio carried at fair value on a recurring basis had a cost basis of $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2. During the year ended December 31, 2016, transfers from level 3 to level 2 included the following: • $1.4 billion of long-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a reduction of the significance in the unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, transfers from level 2 to level 3 included the following: • $1.1 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance in unobservable inputs. • $1.0 billion of trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. During the year ended December 31, 2015, transfers from level 3 to level 2 included the following: • $3.1 billion of long-term debt and $1.0 billion of deposits driven by an increase in observability on certain structured notes with embedded interest rate and FX derivatives and a reduction of the significance in the unobservable inputs for certain structured notes with embedded equity derivatives. • $2.1 billion of gross equity derivatives for both receivables and payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance in unobservable inputs; partially offset by transfers into level 3 resulting in net transfers of approximately $1.2 billion for both receivables and payables. • $2.8 billion of trading loans driven by an increase in observability of certain collateralized financing transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2015, transfers from level 2 to level 3 included the following: • $2.4 billion of corporate debt driven by a decrease in the significance in the unobservable inputs and an increase in observability for certain structured products During the year ended December 31, 2014, transfers from level 3 to level 2 included the following: • $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and payables, respectively, due to increased observability of certain equity option valuation inputs • $2.7 billion of trading loans, $2.6 billion of margin loans, $2.3 billion of private equity investments, $2.0 billion of corporate debt, and $1.3 billion of long-term debt, based on increased liquidity and price transparency • Transfers from level 2 into level 3 included $1.1 billion of other borrowed funds, $1.1 billion of trading loans and $1.0 billion of long-term debt, based on a decrease in observability of valuation inputs and price transparency. All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 157 Level 3 valuations The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see pages 150–153 of this Note. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, but not limited to, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/ or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at December 31, 2016, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range presented; equity correlation inputs were concentrated at the upper end of the range; the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented; and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented. In addition, the interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range presented; equity volatilities were concentrated in the lower half end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated in the middle of the range presented.

Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) The unobservable inputs and associated input ranges for approximately $394 million of credit derivative receivables and $226 million of credit derivative payables with underlying commercial mortgage risk have been included in the inputs and ranges provided for commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans. (c) The unobservable inputs and associated input ranges for approximately $362 million of credit derivative receivables and $333 million of credit derivative payables with underlying ABS risk have been included in the inputs and ranges provided for corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other. (d) Long-term debt, other borrowed funds and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 159 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market- making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument- specific factors. Notes to consolidated financial statements 160 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables (e.g., how the change in one variable influences the change in the other). Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity and foreign exchange) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The range of correlation inputs between risks within the same asset class are generally narrower than those between underlying risks across asset classes. In addition, the ranges of credit correlation inputs tend to be narrower than those affecting other asset classes. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. EBITDA multiple – EBITDA multiples refer to the input (often derived from the value of a comparable company) that is multiplied by the historic and/or expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of a company in order to estimate the company’s value. An increase in the EBITDA multiple, in isolation, net of adjustments, would result in an increase in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 1.0% of total Firm assets at December 31, 2016. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2015, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 165. For the year ended December 31, 2016 Level 3 assets were $23.2 billion at December 31, 2016, reflecting a decrease of $8.0 billion from December 31, 2015. This decrease was driven by settlements (including repayments and restructurings) and transfers to Level 2 due to an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. In particular: • $4.0 billion decrease in trading assets — debt and equity instruments was predominantly driven by a decrease of $1.8 billion in trading loans largely due to settlements, and a $1.5 billion decrease in asset-backed securities due to settlements and transfers from level 3 to level 2 as a result of increased observability of certain valuation inputs • $2.1 billion decrease in gross derivative receivables was driven by a decrease in credit and foreign exchange derivative receivables due to market movements and transfers from level 3 to level 2 as a result of increased observability of certain valuation inputs Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 160–164. 2016 • There were no individually significant movements for the year ended December 31, 2016. 2015 • $1.6 billion of net gains in interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivative receivables largely due to market movements; partially offset by losses on commodity derivatives due to market movements • $1.3 billion of net gains in liabilities due to market movements 2014 • $1.8 billion of losses on MSRs. For further discussion of the change, refer to Note 17 • $1.1 billion of net gains on trading assets — debt and equity instruments, largely driven by market movements and client-driven financing transactions Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected credit exposure across all of the Firm’s positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses as a result of a counterparty credit event. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the expected positive exposure to each counterparty based on a simulation that assumes the current population of existing derivatives with each counterparty remains unchanged and considers contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset; (ii) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (iii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. DVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect the credit quality of the Firm. The derivative DVA calculation methodology is generally consistent with the CVA methodology described above and incorporates JPMorgan Chase’s credit spread as observed through the CDS market to estimate the PD and LGD as a result of a systemic event affecting the Firm. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) OTC derivatives, leverages its existing CVA and DVA calculation methodologies, and considers the fact that the Firm’s own credit risk is a significant component of funding costs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 165 The key inputs to FVA are: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; (ii) for assets, the estimated market funding cost in the principal market; and (iii) for liabilities, the hypothetical market funding cost for a transfer to a market participant with a similar credit standing as the Firm. For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary. The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The DVA and FVA reported below include the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Credit adjustments: Derivatives CVA $ (84) $ 620 $ (322) Derivatives DVA and FVA 7 73 (58) Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities is measured using (i) the current fair value of the liability and (ii) changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Effective January 1, 2016, the effect of DVA on fair value option elected liabilities is recognized in OCI. See Note 25 for further information. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis At December 31, 2016 and 2015, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, consisting predominantly of loans that had fair value adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2016, $735 million and $822 million of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At December 31, 2015, $696 million and $959 million of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at December 31, 2016 and 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 related to assets held at the balance sheet date. Of the $822 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2016: • $462 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3, as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 12% to 47%, with a weighted average of 25%. The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, related to financial instruments held at those dates, were losses of $172 million, $294 million and $992 million respectively; these reductions were predominantly associated with loans. For further information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14. Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included in the following table. However, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of these disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures provided in the following table include only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s assets and liabilities. For example, the Firm has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this Note. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, commercial paper, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, other borrowed funds, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted. Notes to consolidated financial statements 166 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values at December 31, 2016 and 2015, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, see Valuation hierarchy on pages 150–153. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 167 The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, see page 151 of this Note. Notes to consolidated financial statements 168 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 4 – Fair value option The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g. certain instruments elected were previously accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis • Certain securities financing arrangements with an embedded derivative and/or a maturity of greater than one year • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of CIB’s client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 169 Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table. 2016 2015 2014 December 31, (in millions) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ (76) $ — $ (76) $ (38) $ — $ (38) $ (15) $ — $ (15) Securities borrowed 1 — 1 (6) — (6) (10) — (10) Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans 120 (1) (c) 119 756 (10) (c) 746 639 — 639 Loans reported as trading assets: Changes in instrument- specific credit risk 461 43 (c) 504 138 41 (c) 179 885 29 (c) 914 Other changes in fair value 79 684 (c) 763 232 818 (c) 1,050 352 1,353 (c) 1,705 Loans: Changes in instrument-specific credit risk 13 — 13 35 — 35 40 — 40 Other changes in fair value (7) — (7) 4 — 4 34 — 34 Other assets 20 62 (d) 82 79 (1) (d) 78 24 6 (d) 30 Deposits(a) (134) — (134) 93 — 93 (287) — (287) Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements(a) 19 — 19 8 — 8 (33) — (33) Other borrowed funds(a) (236) — (236) 1,996 — 1,996 (891) — (891) Trading liabilities 6 — 6 (20) — (20) (17) — (17) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 23 — 23 49 — 49 (233) — (233) Other liabilities — — — — — — (27) — (27) Long-term debt: DVA on fair value option elected liabilities (a) — — — 300 — 300 101 — 101 Other changes in fair value(b) (773) — (773) 1,088 — 1,088 (615) — (615) (a) Effective January 1, 2016, unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected is recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue.

See Notes 3 and 25 for further information. (b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes containing embedded derivatives. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 170 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which a fair value election was made The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread. • Resale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowed agreements and securities lending agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements. Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. 2016 2015 December 31, (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Loans(a) Nonaccrual loans Loans reported as trading assets $ 3,338 $ 748 $ (2,590) $ 3,484 $ 631 $ (2,853) Loans — — — 7 7 — Subtotal 3,338 748 (2,590) 3,491 638 (2,853) All other performing loans Loans reported as trading assets 35,477 33,054 (2,423) 30,780 28,184 (2,596) Loans 2,259 2,228 (31) 2,771 2,752 (19) Total loans $ 41,074 $ 36,030 $ (5,044) $ 37,042 $ 31,574 $ (5,468) Long-term debt Principal-protected debt $ 21,602 (c) $ 19,195 $ (2,407) $ 17,910 (c) $ 16,611 $ (1,299) Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA 18,491 NA NA 16,454 NA Total long-term debt NA $ 37,686 NA NA $ 33,065 NA Long-term beneficial interests Nonprincipal-protected debt NA $ 120 NA NA $ 787 NA Total long-term beneficial interests NA $ 120 NA NA $ 787 NA (a) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected notes. Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $4.6 billion for both years, with a corresponding fair value of $(118) million and $(94) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain collateral when deemed necessary. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are evaluated primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual customer basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, and collateral and other risk- reduction techniques. For additional information on loans, see Note 14. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product (e.g., option ARMs), or industry segment (e.g., commercial real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 173 The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale-related credit exposure by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 2016 2015 Credit exposure On-balance sheet Off-balance sheet(g) Credit exposure On-balance sheet Off-balance sheet(g)December 31, (in millions) Loans Derivatives Loans Derivatives Consumer, excluding credit card $ 419,441 $ 364,644 $ — $ 54,797 $ 403,299 $ 344,821 $ — $ 58,478 Receivables from customers(a) 120 — — — 125 — — — Total Consumer, excluding credit card 419,561 364,644 — 54,797 403,424 344,821 — 58,478 Credit Card 695,707 141,816 — 553,891 646,981 131,463 — 515,518 Total consumer-related 1,115,268 506,460 — 608,688 1,050,405 476,284 — 573,996 Wholesale-related(b) Real Estate 135,041 106,315 222 28,504 116,857 92,820 312 23,725 Consumer & Retail 85,435 29,842 1,082 54,511 85,460 27,175 1,573 56,712 Technology, Media & Telecommunications 62,950 13,845 1,227 47,878 57,382 11,079 1,032 45,271 Industrials 55,449 17,150 1,615 36,684 54,386 16,791 1,428 36,167 Healthcare 47,866 15,120 2,277 30,469 46,053 16,965 2,751 26,337 Banks & Finance Cos 44,614 19,460 12,232 12,922 43,398 20,401 10,218 12,779 Oil & Gas 40,099 13,079 1,878 25,142 42,077 13,343 1,902 26,832 Asset Managers 31,886 10,539 10,819 10,528 23,815 6,703 7,733 9,379 Utilities 29,622 7,183 883 21,556 30,853 5,294 1,689 23,870 State & Municipal Govt(c) 28,263 12,416 2,096 13,751 29,114 9,626 3,287 16,201 Central Govt 20,408 3,964 14,235 2,209 17,968 2,000 13,240 2,728 Transportation 19,029 8,942 751 9,336 19,227 9,157 1,575 8,495 Automotive 16,635 4,943 1,190 10,502 13,864 4,473 1,350 8,041 Chemicals & Plastics 14,988 5,287 271 9,430 15,232 4,033 369 10,830 Metals & Mining 13,419 4,350 439 8,630 14,049 4,622 607 8,820 Insurance 13,151 947 3,382 8,822 11,889 1,094 1,992 8,803 Financial Markets Infrastructure 8,732 347 3,884 4,501 7,973 724 2,602 4,647 Securities Firms 3,867 794 1,913 1,160 4,412 861 1,424 2,127 All other(d) 144,428 109,267 3,682 31,479 149,117 109,889 4,593 34,635 Subtotal 815,882 383,790 64,078 368,014 783,126 357,050 59,677 366,399 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 4,515 4,515 — — 3,965 3,965 — — Receivables from customers and other(a) 17,440 — — — 13,372 — — — Total wholesale-related 837,837 388,305 64,078 368,014 800,463 361,015 59,677 366,399 Total exposure(e)(f) $ 1,953,105 $ 894,765 $ 64,078 $ 976,702 $1,850,868 $ 837,299 $ 59,677 $ 940,395 (a) Receivables from customers primarily represent margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 174 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 6 – Derivative instruments Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market- making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative transactions or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities. Interest rate contracts are used to minimize fluctuations in earnings that are caused by changes in interest rates. Fixed- rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increases or decreases as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are related to such assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability in earnings. The Firm generally uses interest rate swaps, forwards and futures to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities contracts are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see the discussion in the Credit derivatives section on pages 184– 186 of this Note. For more information about risk management derivatives, see the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 184 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 182–184 of this Note. Derivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients where the Firm acts as a clearing member with respect to certain derivative exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information on the Firm’s clearing services, see Note 29. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. For further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, see Note 1. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 178–184 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. For further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes, see Notes 3 and 4. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 175 Derivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, as well as nonstatistical methods including dollar- value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. Any hedge ineffectiveness (i.e., the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk) must be reported in current-period earnings. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in OCI and recognized in the Consolidated statements of income when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For foreign currency qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in the translation adjustments account within AOCI.

(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 179 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds) and cash collateral held at third party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below. 2016 2015 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative receivables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 365,227 $ (342,173) $ 23,054 $ 417,386 $ (396,506) $ 20,880 OTC–cleared 235,399 (235,261) 138 246,750 (246,742) 8 Exchange-traded(a) 241 (227) 14 — — — Total interest rate contracts 600,867 (577,661) 23,206 664,136 (643,248) 20,888 Credit contracts: OTC 23,130 (22,612) 518 44,082 (43,182) 900 OTC–cleared 5,746 (5,739) 7 6,866 (6,863) 3 Total credit contracts 28,876 (28,351) 525 50,948 (50,045) 903 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 226,271 (208,962) 17,309 175,060 (162,377) 12,683 OTC–cleared 1,238 (1,165) 73 323 (321) 2 Exchange-traded(a) 104 (27) 77 — — — Total foreign exchange contracts 227,613 (210,154) 17,459 175,383 (162,698) 12,685 Equity contracts: OTC 20,868 (20,570) 298 20,690 (20,439) 251 OTC–cleared — — — — — — Exchange-traded(a) 11,439 (9,431) 2,008 12,285 (9,891) 2,394 Total equity contracts 32,307 (30,001) 2,306 32,975 (30,330) 2,645 Commodity contracts: OTC 11,571 (5,605) 5,966 15,001 (6,772) 8,229 OTC–cleared — — — — — — Exchange-traded(a) 6,794 (6,766) 28 9,199 (9,108) 91 Total commodity contracts 18,365 (12,371) 5,994 24,200 (15,880) 8,320 Derivative receivables with appropriate legal opinions 908,028 (858,538) (b) 49,490 947,642 (902,201) (b) 45,441 Derivative receivables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 14,588 14,588 14,236 14,236 Total derivative receivables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 922,616 $ 64,078 $ 961,878 $ 59,677 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(c)(d) (18,638) (13,543) Net amounts $ 45,440 $ 46,134 Notes to consolidated financial statements 180 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 2016 2015 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative payables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 338,502 $ (329,325) $ 9,177 $ 393,709 $ (384,576) $ 9,133 OTC–cleared 230,464 (230,463) 1 240,398 (240,369) 29 Exchange-traded(a) 196 (175) 21 — — — Total interest rate contracts 569,162 (559,963) 9,199 634,107 (624,945) 9,162 Credit contracts: OTC 22,366 (21,614) 752 44,379 (43,019) 1,360 OTC–cleared 5,641 (5,641) — 5,969 (5,969) — Total credit contracts 28,007 (27,255) 752 50,348 (48,988) 1,360 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 228,300 (213,296) 15,004 185,178 (170,830) 14,348 OTC–cleared 1,158 (1,158) — 301 (301) — Exchange-traded(a) 328 (9) 319 — — — Total foreign exchange contracts 229,786 (214,463) 15,323 185,479 (171,131) 14,348 Equity contracts: OTC 24,688 (20,808) 3,880 23,458 (19,589) 3,869 OTC–cleared — — — — — — Exchange-traded(a) 10,004 (9,414) 590 10,998 (9,891) 1,107 Total equity contracts 34,692 (30,222) 4,470 34,456 (29,480) 4,976 Commodity contracts: OTC 12,885 (5,252) 7,633 16,953 (6,256) 10,697 OTC–cleared — — — — — — Exchange-traded(a) 7,099 (6,853) 246 9,374 (9,322) 52 Total commodity contracts 19,984 (12,105) 7,879 26,327 (15,578) 10,749 Derivative payables with appropriate legal opinions 881,631 (844,008) (b) 37,623 930,717 (890,122) (b) 40,595 Derivative payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 11,608 11,608 12,195 12,195 Total derivative payables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 893,239 $ 49,231 $ 942,912 $ 52,790 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(c)(d)(e) (8,925) (7,957) Net amounts $ 40,306 $ 44,833 (a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.

(e) Derivative payables collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. Amounts exclude collateral transferred related to exchange- traded derivative instruments. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 181 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk. The amount of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets is the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 21,550 $ 22,328 Collateral posted 19,383 18,942 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at December 31, 2016 and 2015, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 13, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at December 31, 2016 was not material. Notes to consolidated financial statements 182 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items, due to changes in foreign currency rates, were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. (f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time values. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 183 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income, and for the forecasted transactions that the Firm determined during the year ended December 31, 2015, were probable of not occurring, in other income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. (c) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2016 and 2014. In 2015, the Firm reclassified approximately $150 million of net losses from AOCI to other income because the Firm determined that it was probable that the forecasted interest payment cash flows would not occur as a result of the planned reduction in wholesale non-operating deposits. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $151 million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2016, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately six years. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately one year. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. Notes to consolidated financial statements 184 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) 2016 2015 2014 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Excluded components recorded directly in income(a) Effective portion recorded in OCI Excluded components recorded directly in income(a) Effective portion recorded in OCI Excluded components recorded directly in income(a) Effective portion recorded in OCI Foreign exchange derivatives $(282) $262 $(379) $1,885 $(448) $1,698 (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in other income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates and, therefore, there was no significant ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (d) Primarily relates to commodity derivatives used to mitigate energy price risk associated with energy-related contracts and investments. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 7 for information on principal transactions revenue. Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 185 Credit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes. Notes to consolidated financial statements 186 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 187 Note 7 – Noninterest revenue Investment banking fees The following table presents the components of investment banking fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Underwriting Equity $ 1,146 $ 1,408 $ 1,571 Debt 3,207 3,232 3,340 Total underwriting 4,353 4,640 4,911 Advisory 2,095 2,111 1,631 Total investment banking fees $ 6,448 $ 6,751 $ 6,542 Underwriting fees are recognized as revenue when the Firm has rendered all services to, and is entitled to collect the fee from, the issuer, and there are no other contingencies associated with the fee. Underwriting fees are net of syndicate expense; the Firm recognizes credit arrangement and syndication fees as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed and the fee has been earned. Principal transactions Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of the realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client- driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives. For further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities, see Note 6. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities. See Note 8 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client- driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Trading revenue by instrument type Interest rate $ 2,325 $ 1,933 $ 1,362 Credit 2,096 1,735 1,880 Foreign exchange 2,827 2,557 1,556 Equity 2,994 2,990 2,563 Commodity 1,067 842 1,663 Total trading revenue 11,309 10,057 9,024 Private equity gains(a) 257 351 1,507 Principal transactions $ 11,566 $ 10,408 $ 10,531 (a) Includes revenue on private equity investments held in the Private Equity business within Corporate, as well as those held in other business segments. Lending- and deposit-related fees The following table presents the components of lending- and deposit-related fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Lending-related fees $ 1,114 $ 1,148 $ 1,307 Deposit-related fees 4,660 4,546 4,494 Total lending- and deposit-related fees $ 5,774 $ 5,694 $ 5,801 Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Deposit- related fees include fees earned in lieu of compensating balances, and fees earned from performing cash management activities and other deposit account services. Lending- and deposit-related fees in this revenue category are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Notes to consolidated financial statements 188 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Asset management, administration and commissions The following table presents Firmwide asset management, administration and commissions income: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Asset management fees Investment management fees(a) $ 8,865 $ 9,403 $ 9,169 All other asset management fees(b) 336 352 477 Total asset management fees 9,201 9,755 9,646 Total administration fees(c) 1,915 2,015 2,179 Commissions and other fees Brokerage commissions 2,151 2,304 2,270 All other commissions and fees 1,324 1,435 1,836 Total commissions and fees 3,475 3,739 4,106 Total asset management, administration and commissions $ 14,591 $ 15,509 $ 15,931 (a) Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firm’s clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. (b) Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. (c) Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds services and securities clearance. This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody and brokerage services, insurance premiums and commissions, and fees from other products and services. These fees are recognized over the period in which the related product or service is provided. Performance-based fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets, are accrued and recognized at the end of the performance period in which the target is met. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain services in connection with its asset management activities. Amounts paid to third-party service providers are predominantly expensed, such that asset management fees are recorded gross of payments made to third parties. Mortgage fees and related income This revenue category primarily reflects CCB’s Mortgage Banking production and servicing revenue, including fees and income derived from mortgages originated with the intent to sell; mortgage sales and servicing including losses related to the repurchase of previously sold loans; the impact of risk-management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRs; and revenue related to any residual interests held from mortgage securitizations. This revenue category also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments for mortgage loans held-for-sale, as well as changes in fair value for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are reported in mortgage fees and related income. For a further discussion of MSRs, see Note 17. Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income. Card income This revenue category includes interchange income from credit and debit cards and net fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is recognized as earned. Costs related to rewards programs are recorded when the rewards are earned by the customer and presented as a reduction to interchange income. Annual fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co- brand partners which grant the Firm exclusive rights to market to the customers or members of such partners. These partners endorse the credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm, and they may also conduct marketing activities and provide awards under the various credit card programs. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years. The Firm typically makes incentive payments to the partners based on new account originations, sales volumes and the cost of the partners’ marketing activities and awards. Payments based on new account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are deducted from interchange income as the related revenue is earned. Payments based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as noninterest expense. Other income Other income on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income included the following: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Operating lease income $ 2,724 $ 2,081 $ 1,699 Operating lease income is recognized on a straight–line basis over the lease term. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 189 Note 8 – Interest income and Interest expense Interest income and interest expense are recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and classified based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Interest Income Loans(a) $ 36,634 $ 33,134 $ 32,218 Taxable securities 5,538 6,550 7,617 Non taxable securities(b) 1,766 1,706 1,423 Total securities 7,304 8,256 9,040 Trading assets 7,292 6,621 7,312 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 2,265 1,592 1,642 Securities borrowed(c) (332) (532) (501) Deposits with banks 1,863 1,250 1,157 Other assets(d) 875 652 663 Total interest income $ 55,901 $ 50,973 $ 51,531 Interest expense Interest bearing deposits $ 1,356 $ 1,252 $ 1,633 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 1,089 609 604 Commercial paper 135 110 134 Trading liabilities - debt, short- term and other liabilities(e) 1,170 622 712 Long-term debt 5,564 4,435 4,409 Beneficial interest issued by consolidated VIEs 504 435 405 Total interest expense $ 9,818 $ 7,463 $ 7,897 Net interest income $ 46,083 $ 43,510 $ 43,634 Provision for credit losses 5,361 3,827 3,139 Net interest income after provision for credit losses $ 40,722 $ 39,683 $ 40,495 (a) Includes the amortization of purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs. (b) Represents securities that are tax exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. (c) Securities borrowed’s negative interest income, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, is a result of client-driven demand for certain securities combined with the impact of low interest rates; this is matched book activity and the negative interest expense on the corresponding securities loaned is recognized in interest expense. (d) Largely margin loans. (e) Includes brokerage customer payables. Interest income and interest expense includes the current- period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Note 9 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees. These plans are discussed below. Defined benefit pension plans The Firm has a qualified noncontributory U.S. defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. The U.S. plan employs a cash balance formula in the form of pay and interest credits to determine the benefits to be provided at retirement, based on years of service and eligible compensation (generally base salary/ regular pay and variable cash incentive compensation capped at $100,000 annually). Employees begin to accrue plan benefits after completing one year of service, and benefits generally vest after three years of service. The Firm also offers benefits through defined benefit pension plans to qualifying employees in certain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It is the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate at this time any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2017. The 2017 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $44 million of which $28 million are contractually required. JPMorgan Chase also has a number of defined benefit pension plans that are not subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The most significant of these plans is the Excess Retirement Plan, pursuant to which certain employees previously earned pay credits on compensation amounts above the maximum stipulated by law under a qualified plan; no further pay credits are allocated under this plan. The Excess Retirement Plan had an unfunded projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) in the amount of $215 million and $237 million, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Defined contribution plans JPMorgan Chase currently provides two qualified defined contribution plans in the U.S. and other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations, all of which are administered in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (the “401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The JPMorgan Chase Common Stock Fund, which is an investment option under the 401(k) Savings Plan, is a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan. The Firm matches eligible employee contributions up to 5% of eligible compensation (generally base salary/regular pay and variable cash incentive compensation) on an annual basis. Employees begin to receive matching contributions Notes to consolidated financial statements 190 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report after completing a one-year-of-service requirement. Employees with total annual cash compensation of $250,000 or more are not eligible for matching contributions. Matching contributions vest after three years of service. The 401(k) Savings Plan also permits discretionary profit-sharing contributions by participating companies for certain employees, subject to a specified vesting schedule. OPEB plans JPMorgan Chase offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain retirees and postretirement medical benefits to qualifying U.S. employees. These benefits vary with the length of service and the date of hire and provide for limits on the Firm’s share of covered medical benefits. The medical and life insurance benefits are both contributory. Effective January 1, 2015, there was a transition of certain Medicare eligible retirees from JPMorgan Chase group sponsored coverage to Medicare exchanges. As a result of this change, eligible retirees will receive a Healthcare Reimbursement Account amount each year if they enroll through the Medicare exchange. The impact of this change was not material. Postretirement medical benefits also are offered to qualifying U.K. employees. JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. OPEB obligation is funded with corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. The U.K. OPEB plan is unfunded. The following table presents the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status amounts reported on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

(b) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $390 million and $533 million, respectively, of U.S. plan assets included participation rights under participating annuity contracts. (c) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, defined benefit pension plan amounts that were not measured at fair value included $130 million and $74 million, respectively, of accrued receivables, and $224 million and $123 million, respectively, of accrued liabilities, for U.S. plans. (d) Includes an unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $35 million and $32 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the U.K. plan. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 191 Gains and losses For the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the PBO or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently seven years and for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. In addition, prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan when the prior service cost is first recognized. The average remaining amortization period for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan for current prior service costs is three years. For the Firm’s OPEB plans, a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. This value is referred to as the market related value of assets. Amortization of net gains and losses, adjusted for gains and losses not yet recognized, is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market related value of assets. Any excess net gain or loss is amortized over the average expected lifetime of retired participants, which is currently twelve years; however, prior service costs resulting from plan changes are amortized over the average years of service remaining to full eligibility age, which is currently two years.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 192 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The estimated pretax amounts that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 are as follows. Defined benefit pension plans OPEB plans (in millions) U.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. Net loss/(gain) $ 216 $ 28 $ — $ — Prior service cost/(credit) (34) (2) — — Total $ 182 $ 26 $ — $ — The following table presents the actual rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. U.S. Non-U.S. Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Actual rate of return: Defined benefit pension plans 6.12% 0.88% 7.29% 1.07 – 20.60% (0.48) – 4.92% 5.62 – 17.69% OPEB plans 7.29 1.16 9.84 NA NA NA Plan assumptions JPMorgan Chase’s expected long-term rate of return for U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan assets is a blended average of the investment advisor’s projected long-term (10 or more years) returns for the various asset classes, weighted by the asset allocation. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of inflation, real bond yield and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect on returns from changing yields. Other asset-class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and bond markets. Consideration is also given to current market conditions and the short- term portfolio mix of each plan. For the U.K. defined benefit pension plans, which represent the most significant of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, procedures similar to those in the U.S. are used to develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on U.K. plan assets is an average of projected long-term returns for each asset class. The return on equities has been selected by reference to the yield on long-term U.K. government bonds plus an equity risk premium above the risk-free rate. The expected return on “AA” rated long-term corporate bonds is based on an implied yield for similar bonds. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans was provided by the Firm’s actuaries. This rate was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows; such portfolios are derived from a broad-based universe of high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. In years in which these hypothetical bond portfolios generate excess cash, such excess is assumed to be reinvested at the one-year forward rates implied by the Mercer Yield Curve published as of the measurement date. The discount rate for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan represents a rate of appropriate duration from the analysis of yield curves provided by the Firm’s actuaries. At December 31, 2016, the Firm decreased the discount rates used to determine its benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans in light of current market interest rates, which will increase expense by approximately $45 million in 2017. The 2017 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets and U.S. OPEB plan assets are 6.00% and 5.00%, respectively. For 2017, the initial health care benefit obligation trend assumption has been set at 5.00%, while the ultimate health care trend assumption and the year to reach the ultimate rate remain at 5.00% and 2017, respectively, unchanged from 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the interest crediting rate assumption remained at 5.00% and the assumed rate of compensation increase was reduced to 2.30%.

Year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions) 1-Percentage point increase 1-Percentage point decrease Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 8 $ (7) JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense is sensitive to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. With all other assumptions held constant, a 25-basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets would result in an aggregate increase of approximately $40 million in 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense. A 25-basis point decline in the discount rate for the U.S. plans would result in an increase in 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense of approximately an aggregate $31 million and an increase in the related benefit obligations of approximately an aggregate $316 million. A 25-basis point decrease in the interest crediting rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan would result in a decrease in 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension expense of approximately $36 million and a decrease in the related PBO of approximately $160 million. A 25-basis point decline in the discount rates for the non- U.S. plans would result in an increase in the 2017 non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan expense of approximately $12 million. Notes to consolidated financial statements 194 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Investment strategy and asset allocation The Firm’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets are held in trust and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments (e.g., hedge funds, private equity, real estate and real assets). Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets are held in various trusts and are also invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securities. Assets of the Firm’s COLI policies, which are used to partially fund the U.S. OPEB plan, are held in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity and fixed income indices. The investment policy for the Firm’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of the plan using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. Periodically the Firm performs a comprehensive analysis on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan asset allocations, incorporating projected asset and liability data, which focuses on the short- and long-term impact of the asset allocation on cumulative pension expense, economic cost, present value of contributions and funded status. Currently, approved asset allocation ranges are: U.S. equity 0% to 45%, international equity 0% to 40%, debt securities 0% to 80%, hedge funds 0% to 5%, real estate 0% to 10%, real assets 0% to 10% and private equity 0% to 20%. Asset allocations are not managed to a specific target but seek to shift asset class allocations within these stated ranges. Investment strategies incorporate the economic outlook and the anticipated implications of the macroeconomic environment on the various asset classes while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity for the plan. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that impact the portfolio, which is rebalanced when deemed necessary. For the U.K. defined benefit pension plans, which represent the most significant of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the assets are invested to maximize returns subject to an appropriate level of risk relative to the plans’ liabilities. To reduce the volatility in returns relative to the plans’ liability profiles, the U.K. defined benefit pension plans’ largest asset allocations are to debt securities of appropriate durations. Other assets, mainly equity securities, are then invested for capital appreciation, to provide long-term investment growth. Similar to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, asset allocations and asset managers for the U.K. plans are reviewed regularly and the portfolios are rebalanced when deemed necessary. Investments held by the U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans include financial instruments that are exposed to various risks such as market, credit, liquidity and country risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investment instruments. Additionally, the investments in each of the common/collective trust funds and registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments. As of December 31, 2016, assets held by the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include JPMorgan Chase common stock, except through indirect exposures through investments in third-party stock-index funds. The plans hold investments in funds that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion for U.S. plans and $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for non-U.S. plans, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation of the fair values of total plan assets at December 31 for the years indicated, as well as the respective approved range/target allocation by asset category, for the Firm’s U.S. and non- U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

(b) Unfunded commitments to purchase limited partnership investments for the plans were $735 million and $895 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. (c) Corporate debt securities include debt securities of U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. (d) Other consists primarily of money market funds and participating and non-participating annuity contracts. Money market funds are primarily classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy given they are valued using market observable prices. Participating and non-participating annuity contracts are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of market mechanisms for transferring each policy and surrender restrictions. (e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair values of these investments, which include certain limited partnerships and common/collective trust funds, were $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments, and $243 million and $234 million, respectively, of non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan investments. (f) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluded U.S. defined benefit pension plan receivables for investments sold and dividends and interest receivables of $130 million and $74 million, respectively. (g) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluded $203 million and $106 million, respectively, of U.S. defined benefit pension plan payables for investments purchased; and $21 million and $17 million, respectively, of other liabilities. (h) There were zero assets or liabilities classified as level 3 for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan was partially funded with COLI policies of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, which were classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2016, 78 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2019. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting stock-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s stock-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination, subject to post-employment and other restrictions based on age or service-related requirements. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding and, as such, are considered participating securities as discussed in Note 24. In January 2016, the Firm’s Board of Directors approved the grant of performance share units (“PSUs”) to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program for performance year 2015. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. The awards vest and are converted into shares of common stock in the quarter after the end of the three-year performance period. In addition, dividends are notionally reinvested in the Firm’s common stock and will be delivered only in respect of any earned shares. Once the PSUs have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of five years from the grant date. Under the LTI Plans, stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. The Firm periodically grants employee stock options to individual employees. There were no material grants of stock options or SARs in 2016, 2015 and 2014. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee stock-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Firm settled all of its employee stock-based awards by issuing treasury shares. In January 2008, the Firm awarded to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer up to 2 million SARs. The terms of this award are distinct from, and more restrictive than, other equity grants regularly awarded by the Firm. On July 15, 2014, the Compensation & Management Development Committee and Board of Directors determined that all requirements for the vesting of the 2 million SAR awards had been met and thus, the awards became exercisable. The SARs, which will expire in January 2018, have an exercise price of $39.83 (the price of JPMorgan Chase common stock on the date of grant). The expense related to this award was dependent on changes in fair value of the SARs through July 15, 2014 (the date when the vested number of SARs were determined), and the cumulative expense was recognized ratably over the service period, which was initially assumed to be five years but, effective in the first quarter of 2013, was extended to six and one-half years. The Firm recognized $3 million in compensation expense in 2014 for this award. Notes to consolidated financial statements 198 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report RSUs, PSUs, employee stock options and SARs activity Compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for employee stock options and SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, employee stock options and SARs activity for 2016. RSUs/PSUs Options/SARs Year ended December 31, 2016 Number of units Weighted- average grant date fair value Number of awards Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in thousands, except weighted-average data, and where otherwise stated) Outstanding, January 1 85,307 $ 54.60 43,466 $ 43.51 Granted 36,775 57.80 77 72.63 Exercised or vested (37,121) 52.09 (12,836) 41.55 Forfeited (3,254) 56.45 (240) 44.28 Canceled NA NA (200) 612.18 Outstanding, December 31 81,707 $ 57.15 30,267 $ 40.65 3.9 $ 1,378,254 Exercisable, December 31 NA NA 24,815 40.08 3.6 1,144,937 The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $2.2 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $338 million, $335 million and $539 million, respectively. Compensation expense The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Cost of prior grants of RSUs, PSUs and SARs that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 1,046 $ 1,109 $ 1,371 Accrual of estimated costs of stock- based awards to be granted in future periods including those to full-career eligible employees 894 878 819 Total noncash compensation expense related to employee stock-based incentive plans $ 1,940 $ 1,987 $ 2,190 At December 31, 2016, approximately $700 million (pretax) of compensation expense related to unvested awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.0 year. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards to employees. Cash flows and tax benefits Effective January 1, 2016, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, all excess tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) on share-based payment awards are recognized within income tax expense in the Consolidated statements of income. In prior years these tax benefits were recorded as increases to additional paid-in capital. Income tax benefits related to stock-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $916 million, $746 million and $854 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the cash received from the exercise of stock options under all stock-based incentive arrangements, and the actual income tax benefit related to tax deductions from the exercise of the stock options. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Cash received for options exercised $ 26 $ 20 $ 63 Tax benefit 70 64 104 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 199 Note 11 – Noninterest expense For details on noninterest expense, see Consolidated statements of income on page 141. Included within other expense are the following: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Legal (benefit)/expense $ (317) $ 2,969 $ 2,883 FDIC-related expense 1,296 1,227 1,037 Note 12 – Securities Securities are classified as trading, AFS or HTM. Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 3. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM investment securities (the “investment securities portfolio”) are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At December 31, 2016, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments, are reported as net increases or decreases to AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM debt securities, which management has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM debt securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the security. During 2016, the Firm transferred commercial MBS and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $7.5 billion from AFS to HTM. These securities were transferred at fair value. AOCI included net pretax unrealized gains of $78 million on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect the Firm’s intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 203 Gross unrealized losses The Firm has recognized unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell as OTTI. The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of December 31, 2016, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2016. Other-than-temporary impairment AFS debt and equity securities and HTM debt securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed as part of the Firm’s ongoing assessment of OTTI. For most types of debt securities, the Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary when the Firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm considers an impairment to be other- than-temporary when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. For AFS equity securities, the Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary if it is probable that the Firm will not recover its cost basis. Potential OTTI is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and the Firm’s intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. For AFS debt securities, the Firm recognizes OTTI losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In these circumstances the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the expected cash flows to be received from the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in OCI. The Firm’s cash flow evaluations take into account the factors noted above and expectations of relevant market and economic data as of the end of the reporting period. For securities issued in a securitization, the Firm estimates cash flows considering underlying loan-level data and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. The Firm also performs other analyses to support its cash flow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios. For equity securities, OTTI losses are recognized in earnings if the Firm intends to sell the security. In other cases the Firm considers the relevant factors noted above, as well as the Firm’s intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and whether evidence exists to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the cost basis. Any impairment loss on an equity security is equal to the full difference between the cost basis and the fair value of the security.

Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities The cumulative credit loss component, including any changes therein, of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities was not material as of and during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

(b) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 205 where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. (c) Includes securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven years for agency residential MBS, three years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and three years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. Note 13 – Securities financing activities JPMorgan Chase enters into resale agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions, accommodate customers’ financing needs, and settle other securities obligations. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. For further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, see Note 1. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. For further information regarding the fair value option, see Note 4. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities financing transactions expose the Firm to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high- quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities exceeds the value of the initial cash principal advanced, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 30. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices with respect to resale and securities borrowed agreements as described above, the Firm did not hold any reserves for credit impairment with respect to these agreements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Notes to consolidated financial statements 206 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2016, and 2015. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces, in the Firm’s view, the economic exposure with the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented below, if the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented. 2016 December 31, (in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets(b) Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(c) Net amounts(d) Assets Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 480,735 $ (250,832) $ 229,903 $ (222,413) $ 7,490 Securities borrowed 96,409 — 96,409 (66,822) 29,587 Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 402,465 $ (250,832) $ 151,633 $ (133,300) $ 18,333 Securities loaned and other(a) 22,451 — 22,451 (22,177) 274 2015 December 31, (in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets(b) Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(c) Net amounts(d) Assets Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 368,148 $ (156,258) $ 211,890 $ (207,958) $ 3,932 (e) Securities borrowed 98,721 — 98,721 (65,081) 33,640 Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 290,044 $ (156,258) $ 133,786 $ (119,332) $ 14,454 (e) Securities loaned and other(a) 22,556 — 22,556 (22,245) 311 (a) Includes securities-for-securities lending transactions of $9.1 billion and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, included securities purchased under resale agreements of $21.5 billion and $23.1 billion, respectively, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $687 million and $3.5 billion, respectively. There were no securities borrowed at December 31, 2016 and $395 million at December 31, 2015. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value in either period.

In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related asset or liability with that counterparty. (d) Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, included $4.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $27.1 billion and $31.3 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $15.9 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively, of securities sold under agreements to repurchase; and $90 million and $45 million, respectively, of securities loaned and other.

These amounts are presented within other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm held $5.9 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated balance sheets. Notes to consolidated financial statements 208 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 14 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value • PCI loans held-for-investment The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories: Loans held-for-investment (other than PCI loans) Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. Interest income Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan to produce a level rate of return. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. However, the Firm separately establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income on credit card loans. The allowance is established with a charge to interest income and is reported as an offset to loans. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the recorded investment to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. See Note 15 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans, other than risk-rated business banking, risk-rated auto and PCI loans, are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, non- modified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Auto, student and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due. Certain consumer loans will be charged off earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: • A charge-off is recognized when a loan is modified in a TDR if the loan is determined to be collateral-dependent. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event (e.g., bankruptcy) that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards. Residential real estate and auto loans are charged off when the loan becomes 60 days past due, or sooner if the loan is determined to be collateral- dependent. Credit card, student and scored business banking loans are charged off within 60 days of JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 209 receiving notification of the bankruptcy filing or other event. • Auto loans are written down to net realizable value upon repossession of the automobile and after a redemption period (i.e., the period during which a borrower may cure the loan) has passed. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on government- guaranteed loans. Wholesale loans, risk-rated business banking loans and risk- rated auto loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized, including situations where a loan is determined to be both impaired and collateral- dependent. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the estimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm obtains a broker’s price opinion of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every six months thereafter. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), generally, either through foreclosure or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower, the Firm obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- and product-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Held-for-sale loans are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Held-for-sale loans are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Because held-for-sale loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. Loans at fair value Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. See Note 4 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 and Note 4 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. PCI loans PCI loans held-for-investment are initially measured at fair value. PCI loans have evidence of credit deterioration since the loan’s origination date and therefore it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Because PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes an estimate of future credit losses, no allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans is recorded at the acquisition date. See page 219 of this Note for information on accounting for PCI loans subsequent to their acquisition. Notes to consolidated financial statements 210 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, see Note 15. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss-mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss, avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired until it matures, is repaid, or is otherwise liquidated, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms. In certain limited cases, the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is at or above the current market rate at the time of the restructuring. In such circumstances, and assuming that the loan subsequently performs under its modified terms and the Firm expects to collect all contractual principal and interest cash flows, the loan is disclosed as impaired and as a TDR only during the year of the modification; in subsequent years, the loan is not disclosed as an impaired loan or as a TDR so long as repayment of the restructured loan under its modified terms is reasonably assured. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Because loans modified in TDRs are considered to be impaired, these loans are measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific allowance methodology throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status and/or the loan has been removed from the impaired loans disclosures (i.e., loans restructured at market rates). For further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance, see Note 15. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 211 Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f) Residential real estate – excluding PCI • Home equity(b) • Residential mortgage(c) Other consumer loans • Auto(d) • Business banking(d)(e) • Student and other Residential real estate – PCI • Home equity • Prime mortgage • Subprime mortgage • Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial • Real estate • Financial institutions • Government agencies • Other(g) (a) Includes loans held in CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. (b) Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans. (c) Includes prime (including option ARMs) and subprime loans. (d) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes. (e) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans as well as deposit overdrafts. (f) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions. (g) Includes loans to: individuals; SPEs; holding companies; and private education and civic organizations. For more information on exposures to SPEs, see Note 16. The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(b) Loans (other than PCI loans and those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unearned income, unamortized discounts and premiums, and net deferred loan costs. These amounts were not material as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Notes to consolidated financial statements 212 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held- for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. 2016 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 4,116 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,448 $ 5,564 Sales 6,368 — 8,739 15,107 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 321 — 2,381 2,702 2015 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 5,279 (a)(b) $ — $ 2,154 $ 7,433 Sales 5,099 — 9,188 14,287 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 1,514 79 642 2,235 2014 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 7,434 (a)(b) $ — $ 885 $ 8,319 Sales 6,655 — 7,381 14,036 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 1,190 3,039 581 4,810 (a) Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (b) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $30.4 billion, $50.3 billion and $15.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following table provides information about gains and losses, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, on loan sales by portfolio segment.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 213 Consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment- option loans that may result in negative amortization. The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Residential real estate – excluding PCI Home equity $ 39,063 $ 45,559 Residential mortgage 192,163 166,239 Other consumer loans Auto 65,814 60,255 Business banking 22,698 21,208 Student and other 8,989 10,096 Residential real estate – PCI Home equity 12,902 14,989 Prime mortgage 7,602 8,893 Subprime mortgage 2,941 3,263 Option ARMs 12,234 13,853 Total retained loans $ 364,406 $ 344,355 Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear that the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, including both non-PCI and PCI portfolios, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit-quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (660 or below) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a high FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. • For scored auto, scored business banking and student loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events. • Risk-rated business banking and auto loans are similar to wholesale loans in that the primary credit quality indicators are the risk rating that is assigned to the loan and whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information about borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations. For further information about risk-rated wholesale loan credit quality indicators, see pages 224–225 of this Note. Residential real estate — excluding PCI loans The following table provides information by class for residential real estate — excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment. The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm’s residential real estate — excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(b) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $6.9 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, these balances included $2.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2016 and 2015. (d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (f) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $9.4 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. (g) Includes residential real estate loans to private banking clients in AWM, for which the primary credit quality indicators are the borrower’s financial position and LTV. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 215 The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate December 31, (in millions except ratios) 2016 2015 2016 2015 HELOCs:(a) Within the revolving period(b) $ 10,304 $ 17,050 1.27% 1.57% Beyond the revolving period 13,272 11,252 3.05 3.10 HELOANs 1,861 2,409 2.85 3.03 Total $ 25,437 $ 30,711 2.32% 2.25% (a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period. (b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the collateral does not support the loan amount. HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 15.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2016, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 12% home equity and 16% of residential mortgages that were 30 days or more past due. (b) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. (c) Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. (e) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, nonaccrual loans included $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer, to the Loan accounting framework on pages 208–210 of this Note.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 217 Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. At December 31, 2016, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for home equity and 10 years for residential mortgage. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). Active and suspended foreclosure At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $932 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S. (c) Other consumer average impaired loans were $635 million, $566 million and $599 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 219 Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.The following table provides information about the Firm’s other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Loans modified in TDRs(a)(b) $ 362 $ 384 TDRs on nonaccrual status 226 275 (a) The impact of these modifications was not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. (b) Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial. Purchased credit-impaired loans PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value at acquisition. PCI loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter may be aggregated into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. With respect to the Washington Mutual transaction, all of the consumer PCI loans were aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics. On a quarterly basis, the Firm estimates the total cash flows (both principal and interest) expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool. These estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect then-current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows (i.e., increased credit losses) trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related forgone interest cash flows, discounted at the pool’s effective interest rate. Impairments are recognized through the provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. The Firm continues to modify certain PCI loans. The impact of these modifications is incorporated into the Firm’s quarterly assessment of whether a probable and significant change in expected cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans. In evaluating the effect of modifications on expected cash flows, the Firm incorporates the effect of any forgone interest and also considers the potential for redefault. The Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are used to compute expected credit losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified PCI loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the underlying loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not reported on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying pools of loans. If the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on PCI loan pools were determined not to be reasonably estimable, no interest would be accreted and the loan pools would be reported as nonaccrual loans; however, since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for the Firm’s PCI consumer loan pools are reasonably estimable, interest is being accreted and the loan pools are being reported as performing loans. The liquidation of PCI loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payment in full from the borrower, or foreclosure, results in removal of the loans from the underlying PCI pool. When the amount of the liquidation proceeds (e.g., cash, real estate), if any, is less than the unpaid principal balance of the loan, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool’s nonaccretable difference for principal losses (i.e., the lifetime credit loss estimate established as a purchase accounting adjustment at the acquisition date). When the nonaccretable difference for a particular loan pool has been fully depleted, any excess of the unpaid principal balance of the loan over the liquidation proceeds is written off against the PCI pool’s allowance for loan losses. Beginning in 2014, write-offs of PCI loans also include other adjustments, primarily related to interest forgiveness modifications. Because the Firm’s PCI loans are accounted for at a pool level, the Firm does not recognize charge-offs of PCI loans when they reach specified stages of delinquency (i.e., unlike non-PCI consumer loans, these loans are not charged off based on FFIEC standards). The PCI portfolio affects the Firm’s results of operations primarily through: (i) contribution to net interest margin; (ii) expense related to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii) any provision for loan losses. The PCI loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction were funded based on the interest rate characteristics of the loans. For example, variable-rate loans were funded with variable-rate liabilities and fixed- rate loans were funded with fixed-rate liabilities with a similar maturity profile. A net spread will be earned on the declining balance of the portfolio, which is estimated as of December 31, 2016, to have a remaining weighted-average life of 8 years.

(b) Management concluded as part of the Firm’s regular assessment of the PCI loan pools that it was probable that higher expected credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows. As a result, an allowance for loan losses for impairment of these pools has been recognized. (c) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (d) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 221 Approximately 24% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table sets forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

(b) Substantially all undrawn HELOCs within the revolving period have been closed. (c) Includes loans modified into fixed rate amortizing loans. The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.

(b) Reclassifications from the nonaccretable difference in the year ended December 31, 2015 were driven by continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, as well as increased granularity in the impairment estimates. Active and suspended foreclosure At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. Notes to consolidated financial statements 222 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Credit card loan portfolio The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. However, the distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table; FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology. The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s credit card loans. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except ratios) 2016 2015 Net charge-offs $ 3,442 $ 3,122 % of net charge-offs to retained loans 2.63% 2.51% Loan delinquency Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing $ 139,434 $ 129,502 30–89 days past due and still accruing 1,134 941 90 or more days past due and still accruing 1,143 944 Total retained credit card loans $ 141,711 $ 131,387 Loan delinquency ratios % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans 1.61% 1.43% % of 90+ days past due to total retained loans 0.81 0.72 Credit card loans by geographic region California $ 20,571 $ 18,802 Texas 13,220 11,847 New York 12,249 11,360 Florida 8,585 7,806 Illinois 8,189 7,655 New Jersey 6,271 5,879 Ohio 4,906 4,700 Pennsylvania 4,787 4,533 Michigan 3,741 3,562 Colorado 3,699 3,399 All other 55,493 51,844 Total retained credit card loans $ 141,711 $ 131,387 Percentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores(a) Equal to or greater than 660 84.4% 84.4% Less than 660 14.2 13.1 No FICO available 1.4 2.5 (a) The current period percentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores disclosures have been updated to reflect where the FICO score is unavailable.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 223 Credit card impaired loans and loan modifications The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs. December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Impaired credit card loans with an allowance(a)(b) Credit card loans with modified payment terms(c) $ 1,098 $ 1,286 Modified credit card loans that have reverted to pre-modification payment terms(d) 142 179 Total impaired credit card loans(e) $ 1,240 $ 1,465 Allowance for loan losses related to impaired credit card loans $ 358 $ 460 (a) The carrying value and the unpaid principal balance are the same for credit card impaired loans. (b) There were no impaired loans without an allowance. (c) Represents credit card loans outstanding to borrowers enrolled in a credit card modification program as of the date presented. (d) Represents credit card loans that were modified in TDRs but that have subsequently reverted back to the loans’ pre-modification payment terms. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $94 million and $113 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $48 million and $66 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed. (e) Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S. The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Average impaired credit card loans $ 1,325 $ 1,710 $ 2,503 Interest income on impaired credit card loans 63 82 123 Loan modifications JPMorgan Chase may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications under long-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. The Firm may also offer short-term programs for borrowers who may be in need of temporary relief; however, none are currently being offered. Modifications under all short- and long-term programs typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. Assuming that the cardholder does not begin to perform in accordance with those payment terms, the loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In addition, if a borrower successfully completes a short-term modification program, then the loan reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. However, in most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit. New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $636 million, $638 million and $807 million, respectively. Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except weighted-average data) 2016 2015 2014 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 15.56% 15.08% 14.96% Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 4.76 4.40 4.40 Loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(a) $ 79 $ 85 $ 119 (a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 28.87%, 25.61% and 27.91% as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 224 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings generally represent ratings profiles similar to those defined by S&P and Moody’s. Investment-grade ratings range from “AAA/Aaa” to “BBB-/Baa3.” Noninvestment-grade ratings are classified as noncriticized (“BB+/Ba1 and B-/B3”) and criticized (“CCC+”/“Caa1 and below”), and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher probability of default than noncriticized loans. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. See Note 5 for further detail on industry concentrations.

(d) Other includes individuals, SPEs, holding companies, and private education and civic organizations. For more information on exposures to SPEs, see Note 16. Notes to consolidated financial statements 226 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio for the periods indicated. Exposure consists primarily of secured commercial loans, of which multifamily is the largest segment. Multifamily lending finances acquisition, leasing and construction of apartment buildings, and includes exposure to real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). Other commercial lending largely includes financing for acquisition, leasing and construction, largely for office, retail and industrial real estate, and includes exposure to REITs. Included in real estate loans is $9.2 billion and $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of construction and development exposure consisting of loans originally purposed for construction and development, general purpose loans for builders, as well as loans for land subdivision and pre-development.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 227 Note 15 – Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses covers the consumer, including credit card, portfolio segments (primarily scored) and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio, and represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans, as described below. Management also estimates an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending- related commitments using methodologies similar to those used to estimate the allowance on the underlying loans. During 2016, the Firm did not make any significant changes to the methodologies or policies used to determine its allowance for credit losses; such policies are described in the following paragraphs. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in future periods. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm and discussed with the DRPC and the Audit Committee. As of December 31, 2016, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio). Formula-based component The formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation to provide for incurred credit losses in all consumer loans and performing risk-rated loans, except for any loans restructured in TDRs and PCI loans, which are calculated as a part of the asset-specific and PCI components, respectively, and are discussed later in this Note. See Note 14 for more information on TDRs and PCI loans. Formula-based component - Consumer loans and certain lending-related commitments The formula-based allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio segments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and loss severities) to the recorded investment balances or loan- equivalent amounts of pools of loan exposures with similar risk characteristics over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. In addition, management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for each loan portfolio category, using delinquency trends and other risk characteristics to estimate the total incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Management uses additional statistical methods and considers actual portfolio performance, including actual losses recognized on defaulted loans and collateral valuation trends, to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical loss estimate. The economic impact of potential modifications of residential real estate loans is not included in the statistical calculation because of the uncertainty regarding the type and results of such modifications. The statistical calculation is then adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. However, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, the potential impact of payment recasts within the HELOC portfolio, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. For example, the performance of a HELOC that experiences a payment recast may be affected by both the quality of underwriting standards applied in originating the loan and the general economic conditions in effect at the time of the payment recast. For junior lien products, management considers the delinquency and/or modification status of any senior liens in determining the adjustment. The application of different inputs into the statistical calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the statistical calculation, are subject to management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses for the consumer credit portfolio. Overall, the allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including credit card, is sensitive to changes in the economic environment (e.g., unemployment rates), delinquency rates, the realizable value of collateral (e.g., housing prices), FICO scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors. While all of these factors are important determinants of overall allowance levels, changes in the various factors may not occur at the same time or at the same rate, or changes may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in the other. In addition, changes in these factors would not necessarily be consistent across all geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predict the extent to which changes in these factors would ultimately affect the frequency of losses, the severity of losses or both. Notes to consolidated financial statements 228 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Formula-based component - Wholesale loans and lending- related commitments The Firm’s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating. The formula-based component of the allowance for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the recorded investment balances or loan-equivalent amount over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses. The Firm assesses the credit quality of its borrower or counterparty and assigns a risk rating. Risk ratings are assigned at origination or acquisition, and if necessary, adjusted for changes in credit quality over the life of the exposure. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan or lending-related commitment, among the factors considered are the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Determining risk ratings involves significant judgment; emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could affect the risk rating assigned by the Firm. PD estimates are based on observable external through- the-cycle data, using credit rating agency default statistics. An LGD estimate is assigned to each loan or lending-related commitment. The estimate represents the amount of economic loss if the obligor were to default. The type of obligor, quality of collateral, and the seniority of the Firm’s lending exposure in the obligor’s capital structure affect LGD. LGD estimates are based on the Firm’s history of actual credit losses over more than one credit cycle. Changes to the time period used for PD and LGD estimates (for example, point-in-time loss versus longer-term views of the credit cycle) could also affect the allowance for credit losses. The Firm applies judgment in estimating PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent amounts used in calculating the allowance for credit losses. Wherever possible, the Firm uses independent, verifiable data or the Firm’s own historical loss experience in its models for estimating the allowances, but differences in characteristics between the Firm’s specific loans or lending-related commitments and those reflected in external and Firm- specific historical data could affect loss estimates. Estimates of PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan- equivalent used are subject to periodic refinement based on any changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. The use of different inputs, estimates or methodologies could change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by the Firm. In addition to the modeled loss estimates applied to wholesale loans and lending-related commitments, management applies its judgment to adjust the modeled loss estimates for wholesale loans, taking into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss factors. Historical experience of both LGD and PD are considered when estimating these adjustments. Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated where relevant. These estimates are based on management’s view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic, quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio. Asset-specific component The asset-specific component of the allowance relates to loans considered to be impaired, which includes loans that have been modified in TDRs as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger loans are evaluated individually, while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. Scored loans (i.e., consumer loans) are pooled by product type, while risk-rated loans (primarily wholesale loans) are segmented by risk rating. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are reported as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. In certain cases, the asset-specific allowance is determined using an observable market price, and the allowance is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan’s fair value. Impaired collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. For any of these impaired loans, the amount of the asset-specific allowance required to be recorded, if any, is dependent upon the recorded investment in the loan (including prior charge-offs), expected cash flows and/or fair value of assets. See Note 14 for more information about charge-offs and collateral-dependent loans. The asset-specific component of the allowance for impaired loans that have been modified in TDRs incorporates the effects of forgone interest, if any, in the present value calculation and also incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows, which considers the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product- specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 229 card loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors, including the level of future home prices. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. PCI loans In connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain PCI loans, which are accounted for as described in Note 14. The allowance for loan losses for the PCI portfolio is based on quarterly estimates of the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated remaining lives of the loans. These cash flow projections are based on estimates regarding default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. These estimates are dependent on assumptions regarding the level of future home prices, and the duration of current overall economic conditions, among other factors. These estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool (e.g., upon liquidation). During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Firm recorded a $291 million adjustment to reduce the PCI allowance and the recorded investment in the Firm’s PCI loan portfolio, primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of interest forgiveness modifications. This adjustment had no impact to the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. (b) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. (c) The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses is related to loans that have been modified in a TDR; such allowance is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. (d) Effective January 1, 2015, the Firm no longer includes within its disclosure of wholesale lending-related commitments the unused amount of advised uncommitted lines of credit as it is within the Firm’s discretion whether or not to make a loan under these lines, and the Firm’s approval is generally required prior to funding. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Line of Business Transaction Type Activity Annual Report page references CCB Credit card securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased credit card receivables 232 Mortgage securitization trusts Servicing and securitization of both originated and purchased residential mortgages 233–235 CIB Mortgage and other securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgages and student loans 233–235 Multi-seller conduits Investor intermediation activities: Assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner and structures transactions to meet investor needs 235–237 Municipal bond vehicles 235–236 The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs, but to a lesser extent, as follows: • Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities. • Commercial Banking: CB makes investments in and provides lending to community development entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. In addition, CB provides financing and lending-related services to certain client-sponsored VIEs. In general, CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. • Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 237 of this Note. Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities Credit card securitizations The Card business securitizes both originated and purchased credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm- sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $8.9 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 16% and 22% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of both December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $5.3 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 233 Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including student loans) primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/ or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests, recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans.

(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions. (e) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, 61% and 76%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are carried at fair value, were risk- rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion of investment-grade and $77 million and $93 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $2.4 billion and $3.7 billion of investment-grade and $210 million and $198 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 234 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. See the table on page 237 of this Note for more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations. The Firm does not consolidate a residential mortgage securitization (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 237 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. See the table on page 237 of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. The Firm retains servicing responsibilities for certain student loan securitizations. The Firm has the power to direct the activities of these VIEs through these servicing responsibilities. See the table on page 237 of this Note for more information on the consolidated student loan securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both agency (Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”)) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs, which may be backed by either residential or commercial mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Firm transferred $11.2 billion, $21.9 billion and $22.7 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $647 million, $777 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs. Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. In more limited circumstances, the Firm creates a nonagency re-securitization trust independently and not in conjunction with specific clients. In these circumstances, the Firm is deemed to have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust because of the decisions made during the establishment and design of the trust; therefore, the Firm consolidates the re-securitization VIE if the Firm holds an interest that could potentially be significant. Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third- party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 235 As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re- securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $875 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm held $2.0 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities. The Firm’s exposure to non-consolidated private-label re- securitization entities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was not material. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm consolidated an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities of Firm- sponsored private-label re-securitizations. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal- specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal- specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal- specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. See page 237 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $21.2 billion and $15.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. The Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $7.4 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 29. VIEs associated with investor intermediation activities As a financial intermediary, the Firm creates certain types of VIEs and also structures transactions with these VIEs, typically using derivatives, to meet investor needs. The Firm may also provide liquidity and other support. The risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit, market or liquidity risks to which the Firm is exposed. The principal types of VIEs for which the Firm is engaged in on behalf of clients are municipal bond vehicles. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow investors to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“Floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“Residuals”). The Floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The Residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the Residual is held by a third party investor are typically known as Customer TOB trusts, and Non-Customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. The Firm serves as sponsor for all Non-Customer TOB transactions and certain Customer TOB transactions established prior to 2014. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/ or sponsor. Notes to consolidated financial statements 236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the Floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the Floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered Floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in Floaters. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm held an insignificant amount of Floaters on its Consolidated balance sheets and did not hold any significant amounts during 2016 and 2015. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the Floaters may “put,” or tender, their Floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the Floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the Floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered Floaters. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, if the proceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not sufficient to repay amounts owed to the Firm, as liquidity or tender option provider, the Firm has recourse to the third party Residual holders for any shortfall. Residual holders with reimbursement agreements are required to post collateral with the Firm to support such reimbursement obligations should the market value of the underlying municipal bonds decline. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates Non-Customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. Certain non-consolidated Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party, and not the Firm. See page 237 of this Note for further information on consolidated municipal bond vehicles. The Firm’s exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at December 31, 2016 and 2015, including the ratings profile of the VIEs’ assets, was as follows. December 31, (in millions) Fair value of assets held by VIEs Liquidity facilities Excess/(deficit)(a) Maximum exposure Nonconsolidated municipal bond vehicles 2016 $ 1,096 $ 662 $ 434 $ 662 2015 6,937 3,794 3,143 3,794 Ratings profile of VIE assets(b) Fair value of assets held by VIEs Wt. avg. expected life of assets (years) Investment-grade December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) AAA to AAA- AA+ to AA- A+ to A- BBB+ to BBB- Unrated(c) 2016 $ 264 $ 700 $ 43 $ 24 $ 65 $ 1,096 1.6 2015 1,743 4,631 448 24 91 $ 6,937 4.0 (a) Represents the excess/(deficit) of the fair values of municipal bond assets available to repay the liquidity facilities, if drawn. (b) The ratings scale is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis. (c) These security positions have been defeased by the municipality and no longer carry credit ratings, but are backed by high-quality assets such as U.S. treasuries and cash. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 237 VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

(c) Includes assets classified as cash, AFS securities, and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The difference between total assets and total liabilities recognized for consolidated VIEs represents the Firm’s interest in the consolidated VIEs for each program type. (e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $33.4 billion and $30.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The maturities of the long-term beneficial interests as of December 31, 2016, were as follows: $11.6 billion under one year, $19.1 billion between one and five years, and $2.7 billion over five years. (f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Notes to consolidated financial statements 238 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue. Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization. 2016 2015 2014 Year ended December 31, (in millions, except rates) Residential mortgage(c)(d) Commercial and other(d)(e) Residential mortgage(c)(d) Commercial and other(d)(e) Residential mortgage(c)(d) Commercial and other(d)(e) Principal securitized $ 1,817 $ 8,964 $ 3,008 $ 11,933 $ 2,558 $ 11,911 All cash flows during the period:(a) Proceeds received from loan sales as cash $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 568 Proceeds received from loan sales as securities Level 2 1,831 9,092 2,963 11,968 2,384 11,381 Level 3 — 2 59 43 185 130 Total proceeds received from loan sales $ 1,831 $ 9,094 $ 3,022 $ 12,011 $ 2,569 $ 12,079 Servicing fees collected 477 3 528 3 557 4 Purchases of previously transferred financial assets (or the underlying collateral)(b) 37 — 3 — 121 — Cash flows received on interests 482 1,441 407 597 179 578 (a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.

(c) Includes prime/Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes certain loan securitization transactions entered into with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (d) Key assumptions used to measure residential mortgage retained interests originated during the year included weighted-average life (in years) of 4.5, 4.2 and 5.9 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and weighted-average discount rate of 4.2%, 2.9% and 3.4% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Key assumptions used to measure commercial and other retained interests originated during the year included weighted-average life (in years) of 6.2, 6.2 and 6.5 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and weighted-average discount rate of 5.8%, 4.1% and 4.8% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (e) Includes commercial mortgage and student loan securitizations. Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government- sponsored enterprises, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 17 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 239 The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Carrying value of loans sold $ 52,869 $ 42,161 $ 55,802 Proceeds received from loan sales as cash $ 592 $ 313 $ 260 Proceeds from loans sales as securities(a) 51,852 41,615 55,117 Total proceeds received from loan sales(b) $ 52,444 $ 41,928 $ 55,377 Gains on loan sales(c)(d) $ 222 $ 299 $ 316 (a) Predominantly includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt. (b) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. (c) Gains on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (d) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 29, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated balance sheets $9.6 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had real estate owned of $142 million and $343 million, respectively, and certain foreclosed government- guaranteed residential mortgage loans included in accrued interest and accounts receivable of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 14. Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses The table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The $148.9 billion and $169.6 billion, respectively, of loans securitized at December 31, 2016 and 2015, excludes: $46.4 billion and $62.4 billion, respectively, of securitized loans in which the Firm has no continuing involvement, and $4.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of loan securitizations consolidated on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Notes to consolidated financial statements 240 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 17 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed by the Firm’s Operating Committee.

For 2015 includes $101 million of Private Equity goodwill, which was disposed of as part of the Private Equity sale completed in January 2015. (b) Includes foreign currency translation adjustments, other tax-related adjustments, and, for 2014, goodwill impairment associated with the Firm’s Private Equity business of $276 million. Impairment testing The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Further, except for goodwill related to its heritage Private Equity business of $276 million, the Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2014. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. In the first step, the current fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value (including goodwill), then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value (including goodwill), then a second step is performed. In the second step, the implied current fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step one) to the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. The resulting implied current fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied current fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. If the carrying value of goodwill is less than its implied current fair value, then no goodwill impairment is recognized. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated equity plus goodwill capital as a proxy for the carrying amounts of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of equity to the Firm’s lines of business, which takes into consideration the capital the business segment would require if it were operating independently, incorporating sufficient capital to address regulatory capital requirements (including Basel III) and capital levels for similarly rated peers. Proposed line of business equity levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated equity is further reviewed on a periodic basis and updated as needed. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 241 The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts, which include the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, and which are reviewed with the senior management of the Firm. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firms’ overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the general reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. Management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, estimates of adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Notes to consolidated financial statements 242 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (i.e., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2016 2015 2014 Fair value at beginning of period $ 6,608 $ 7,436 $ 9,614 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 679 550 757 Purchase of MSRs — 435 11 Disposition of MSRs(a) (109) (486) (209) Net additions 570 499 559 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (919) (922) (911) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) (72) (160) (1,608) Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) (35) (112) 133 Discount rates 7 (10) (459) (e) Prepayment model changes and other(c) (63) (123) 108 Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions (91) (245) (218) Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions (163) (405) (1,826) Fair value at December 31, $ 6,096 $ 6,608 $ 7,436 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31, $ (163) $ (405) $ (1,826) Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 2,124 2,533 2,884 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions) 593.3 677.0 756.1 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31, (in billions)(d) 4.7 6.5 8.5 (a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. (e) For the year ending December 31, 2014, the negative impact was primarily related to higher capital allocated to the Mortgage Servicing business, which, in turn, resulted in an increase in the OAS. The resulting OAS assumption was consistent with capital and return requirements the Firm believed a market participant would consider, taking into account factors such as the operating risk environment and regulatory and economic capital requirements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 243 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 CCB mortgage fees and related income Net production revenue $ 853 $ 769 $1,190 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 2,336 2,776 3,303 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (916) (917) (905) Total operating revenue 1,420 1,859 2,398 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a) (72) (160) (1,606) Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b) (91) (245) (218) Change in derivative fair value and other 380 288 1,796 Total risk management 217 (117) (28) Total net mortgage servicing revenue 1,637 1,742 2,370 Total CCB mortgage fees and related income 2,490 2,511 3,560 All other 1 2 3 Mortgage fees and related income $2,491 $ 2,513 $3,563 (a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. December 31, (in millions, except rates) 2016 2015 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”) 9.41% 9.81% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (231) $ (275) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (445) (529) Weighted-average option adjusted spread 8.55% 9.54% Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change $ (248) $ (258) Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change (477) (498) CPR: Constant prepayment rate. The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. Notes to consolidated financial statements 244 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 18 – Premises and equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimated useful life of the leased asset. JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis.

Included in senior and subordinated debt below are various equity-linked or other indexed instruments, which the Firm has elected to measure at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated statements of income. The following table is a summary of long-term debt carrying values (including unamortized premiums and discounts, issuance costs, valuation adjustments and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by remaining contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016.

The use of these derivative instruments modifies the Firm’s exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table above. Including the effects of the hedge accounting derivatives, the range of modified rates in effect at December 31, 2016, for total long-term debt was (0.18)% to 8.88%, versus the contractual range of 0.00% to 8.75% presented in the table above. The interest rate ranges shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value. (b) Included long-term debt of $82.2 billion and $76.6 billion secured by assets totaling $205.6 billion and $171.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. (c) Included $37.7 billion and $33.1 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (d) Included $7.5 billion and $5.5 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $25.1 billion and $16.2 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable. (e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $120 million and $787 million accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $5.7 billion and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (f) At December 31, 2016, long-term debt in the aggregate of $81.8 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments. (g) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2016 is $46.7 billion in 2017, $49.4 billion in 2018, $32.2 billion in 2019, $33.8 billion in 2020 and $30.6 billion in 2021. Notes to consolidated financial statements 246 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 2.49% and 2.34% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 2.01% and 1.64% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including both long-term debt and structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $3.9 billion and $152 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price. Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capital debt securities At December 31, 2016, the Firm had outstanding eight wholly-owned Delaware statutory business trusts (“issuer trusts”) that had issued trust preferred securities. The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Firm to the issuer trusts, totaling $2.3 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets in long-term debt, and in the table on the preceding page under the caption “Junior subordinated debt.” The Firm also records the common capital securities issued by the issuer trusts in other assets in its Consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Beginning in 2014, the debentures issued to the issuer trusts by the Firm, less the common capital securities of the issuer trusts, began being phased out from inclusion as Tier 1 capital under Basel III and they were fully phased out as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, $992 million of these debentures qualified as Tier 1 capital. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $1.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, qualified as Tier 2 capital. The Firm redeemed $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of trust preferred securities in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 247 Note 22 – Preferred stock At December 31, 2016 and 2015, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm, JPMorgan Chase’s preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets. The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Each series of preferred stock has a liquidation value and redemption price per share of $10,000, plus accrued but unpaid dividends. Dividends on fixed-rate preferred stock are payable quarterly. Dividends on fixed-to-floating-rate preferred stock are payable semiannually while at a fixed rate, and become payable quarterly after converting to a floating rate. Redemption rights Each series of the Firm’s preferred stock may be redeemed on any dividend payment date on or after the earliest redemption date for that series. All outstanding preferred stock series except Series I may also be redeemed following a “capital treatment event”, as described in the terms of each series. Any redemption of the Firm’s preferred stock is subject to non-objection from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). Note 23 – Common stock At December 31, 2016 and 2015, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0 billion shares of common stock with a par value of $1 per share. Common shares issued (newly issued or distributed from treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Total issued – balance at January 1 4,104.9 4,104.9 4,104.9 Treasury – balance at January 1 (441.4) (390.1) (348.8) Purchase of treasury stock (140.4) (89.8) (82.3) Issued from treasury: Employee benefits and compensation plans 26.0 32.8 39.8 Warrant exercise 11.1 4.7 — Employee stock purchase plans 1.0 1.0 1.2 Total issued from treasury 38.1 38.5 41.0 Total treasury – balance at December 31 (543.7) (441.4) (390.1) Outstanding at December 31 3,561.2 3,663.5 3,714.8 Notes to consolidated financial statements 248 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report At December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, the Firm had 24.9 million, 47.4 million and 59.8 million warrants outstanding to purchase shares of common stock (the “Warrants”). The Warrants are currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and they are exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time until October 28, 2018. The original warrant exercise price was $42.42 per share. The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of each warrant and the warrant exercise price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, the extent to which regular quarterly cash dividends exceed $0.38 per share. As a result of the Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend exceeding $0.38 per share commencing with the second quarter of 2014, the exercise price of the Warrants has been adjusted each subsequent quarter. As of December 31, 2016 the exercise price was $42.073 and the Warrant share number was 1.01. On June 29, 2016, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s release of its 2016 CCAR results, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized a $10.6 billion common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016, $6.1 billion (on a settlement-date basis) of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity- based compensation plans. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, on a settlement-date basis. There were no warrants repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Total number of shares of common stock repurchased 140.4 89.8 82.3 Aggregate purchase price of common stock repurchases $ 9,082 $ 5,616 $ 4,760 The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading “blackout periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities, see Part II, Item 5: Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, on page 22. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 154 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, director compensation plans, and the Warrants. Note 24 – Earnings per share Earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock; these unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2016 2015 2014 Basic earnings per share Net income $ 24,733 $ 24,442 $ 21,745 Less: Preferred stock dividends 1,647 1,515 1,125 Net income applicable to common equity 23,086 22,927 20,620 Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 503 521 543 Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 22,583 $ 22,406 $ 20,077 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,618.5 3,700.4 3,763.5 Net income per share $ 6.24 $ 6.05 $ 5.33 Diluted earnings per share Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 22,583 $ 22,406 $ 20,077 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,618.5 3,700.4 3,763.5 Add: Employee stock options, SARs, warrants and PSUs(a) 31.3 32.4 34.0 Total weighted-average diluted shares outstanding(b) 3,649.8 3,732.8 3,797.5 Net income per share $ 6.19 $ 6.00 $ 5.29 (a) Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS (due to the antidilutive effect) were certain options issued under employee benefit plans. The aggregate number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such options was not material for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and were 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. (b) Participating securities were included in the calculation of diluted EPS using the two-class method, as this computation was more dilutive than the calculation using the treasury stock method. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 249 Note 25 – Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, and net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. Effective January 1, 2016, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected. This guidance requires the portion of the total change in fair value caused by changes in the Firm’s own credit risk (“DVA”) to be presented separately in OCI; previously these amounts were recognized in net income. The guidance was required to be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to the Consolidated balance sheets, which resulted in a reclassification from retained earnings to AOCI.

The amounts were not material for the periods presented. (c) The pre-tax amounts are predominantly recorded in net interest income in the Consolidated statements of income. (d) In 2015, the Firm reclassified approximately $150 million of net losses from AOCI to other income because the Firm determined that it is probable that the forecasted interest payment cash flows will not occur. For additional information, see Note 6. (e) The pre-tax amount is reported in compensation expense in the Consolidated statements of income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 250 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 26 – Income taxes JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported. Effective tax rate and expense A reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. income tax rate to the effective tax rate for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, is presented in the following table. Effective tax rate Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Increase/(decrease) in tax rate resulting from: U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit 2.4 1.5 2.7 Tax-exempt income (3.1) (3.3) (3.1) Non-U.S. subsidiary earnings(a) (1.7) (3.9) (2.0) Business tax credits (3.9) (3.7) (3.3) Nondeductible legal expense 0.3 0.8 2.3 Tax audit resolutions — (5.7) (1.4) Other, net (0.6) (0.3) (1.0) Effective tax rate 28.4% 20.4% 29.2% (a) Predominantly includes earnings of U.K. subsidiaries that are deemed to be reinvested indefinitely. The components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Income tax expense/(benefit) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Current income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal $ 2,488 $ 3,160 $ 2,382 Non-U.S. 1,760 1,220 1,353 U.S. state and local 904 547 857 Total current income tax expense/ (benefit) 5,152 4,927 4,592 Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal 4,364 1,213 3,890 Non-U.S. (73) (95) 71 U.S. state and local 360 215 401 Total deferred income tax expense/(benefit) 4,651 1,333 4,362 Total income tax expense $ 9,803 $ 6,260 $ 8,954 Total income tax expense includes $55 million, $2.4 billion and $451 million of tax benefits recorded in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as a result of tax audit resolutions. Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders’ equity. The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stockholders’ equity resulted in an increase of $925 million in 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion in 2015, and a decrease of $140 million in 2014. Effective January 1, 2016, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, all excess tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) on share-based payment awards are recognized within income tax expense in the Consolidated statements of income. In prior years these tax benefits were recorded as increases to additional paid-in capital. Results from Non-U.S. earnings The following table presents the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income before income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 U.S. $ 26,651 $ 23,191 $ 23,422 Non-U.S.(a) 7,885 7,511 7,277 Income before income tax expense $ 34,536 $ 30,702 $ 30,699 (a) For purposes of this table, non-U.S. income is defined as income generated from operations located outside the U.S. U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. Based on JPMorgan Chase’s JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 251 ongoing review of the business requirements and capital needs of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, combined with the formation of specific strategies and steps taken to fulfill these requirements and needs, the Firm has determined that the undistributed earnings of certain of its subsidiaries would be indefinitely reinvested to fund current and future growth of the related businesses. As management does not intend to use the earnings of these subsidiaries as a source of funding for its U.S. operations, such earnings will not be distributed to the U.S. in the foreseeable future. For 2016, pretax earnings of $3.8 billion were generated and will be indefinitely reinvested in these subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings in these subsidiaries were $38.4 billion. If the Firm were to record a deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, the amount would be $8.8 billion at December 31, 2016. These undistributed earnings are related to subsidiaries located predominantly in the U.K. where the 2016 tax rate was 28%. Affordable housing tax credits The Firm recognized $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense under the current period presentation during these years was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $8.8 billion and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Deferred taxes Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 Deferred tax assets Allowance for loan losses $ 5,534 $ 5,343 Employee benefits 2,911 2,972 Accrued expenses and other 6,831 7,299 Non-U.S. operations 5,368 5,365 Tax attribute carryforwards 2,155 2,602 Gross deferred tax assets 22,799 23,581 Valuation allowance (785) (735) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 22,014 $ 22,846 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation and amortization $ 3,294 $ 3,167 Mortgage servicing rights, net of hedges 4,807 4,968 Leasing transactions 4,053 3,042 Non-U.S. operations 4,572 4,285 Other, net 5,493 4,419 Gross deferred tax liabilities 22,219 19,881 Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets $ (205) $ 2,965 JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2016, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were approximately $3.8 billion and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $142 million. If not utilized, the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire between 2025 and 2036 and the non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire in 2017. Foreign tax credit carryforwards were $776 million and will expire between 2022 and 2026. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2016, was due to losses associated with non-U.S. subsidiaries. Notes to consolidated financial statements 252 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Unrecognized tax benefits At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $3.5 billion, $3.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of which $2.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits by as much as $800 million. Upon settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result from payment or income statement recognition. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Balance at January 1, $ 3,497 $ 4,911 $ 5,535 Increases based on tax positions related to the current period 262 408 810 Increases based on tax positions related to prior periods 583 1,028 477 Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods (785) (2,646) (1,902) Decreases related to cash settlements with taxing authorities (56) (204) (9) Decreases related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations (51) — — Balance at December 31, $ 3,450 $ 3,497 $ 4,911 After-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $86 million, $(156) million and $17 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, in addition to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $687 million and $578 million, respectively, for income tax- related interest and penalties. Tax examination status JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of significant income tax examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016. December 31, 2016 Periods under examination Status JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2003 – 2005 At Appellate level JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2006 – 2010 Field examination of amended returns; certain matters at Appellate level JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2011 – 2013 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York State 2008 – 2011 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York City 2008 – 2011 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – California 2011 – 2012 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – U.K. 2006 – 2014 Field examination of certain select entities JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 253 Note 27 – Restrictions on cash and intercompany funds transfers The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”) is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits. The Federal Reserve requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average required amount of reserve balances deposited by the Firm’s bank subsidiaries with various Federal Reserve Banks was approximately $19.3 billion and $14.4 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate, (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk- based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. Prior to the establishment of the IHC in the fourth quarter of 2016, the principal sources of the Parent Company’s income were dividends and interest from the various bank and non-bank subsidiaries of the Firm; the principal source of the Parent Company’s income, commencing with the fourth quarter, will be dividends from the IHC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the two principal subsidiaries of the Parent Company. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. At January 1, 2017, JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $20 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2017 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year. In compliance with rules and regulations established by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, cash in the amount of $13.4 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, were segregated in special bank accounts for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had receivables within other assets of $16.1 billion and $15.6 billion, respectively, consisting of cash deposited with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers. Securities with a fair value of $19.3 billion and $20.0 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had other restricted cash of $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, primarily representing cash reserves held at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes. Prior period amounts for segregated cash, receivables within other assets, and other restricted cash have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Note 28 – Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries. Basel III presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA: a general (standardized) approach (“Basel III Standardized”) and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Certain of the requirements of Basel III are subject to phase-in periods that began on January 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (“transitional period”). There are three categories of risk-based capital under the Basel III Transitional rules: CET1 capital, as well as Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common stockholders’ equity (including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS as well as for defined-benefit pension and OPEB plans), less certain deductions for goodwill, MSRs and deferred tax assets that arise from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital predominantly consists of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes long- term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Notes to consolidated financial statements 254 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The following tables present the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant national bank subsidiaries under both Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The deduction was not material as of December 31, 2016. (b) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the Tier 1 leverage ratio, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for unrealized gains/(losses) on AFS securities, less deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets, defined benefit pension plan assets, and deferred tax assets related to NOL and tax credit carryforwards. (c) For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are evaluated against the Basel III approach, Standardized or Advanced, resulting in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”), as required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act. (d) The Tier 1 leverage ratio is not a risk-based measure of capital. This ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted average assets. Note: Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both non-taxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from non-taxable business combinations of $83 million and $105 million at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital to RWA, as well as a minimum leverage ratio (which is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. National bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 255 The following table presents the minimum ratios to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject as of December 31, 2016. Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios BHC(a) IDI(b) BHC(c) IDI(d) Capital ratios CET1 6.25% 5.125% —% 6.5% Tier 1 7.75 6.625 6.0 8.0 Total 9.75 8.625 10.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 4.0 — 5.0 Note: The ratios presented in the table above are as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the transitional minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III at December 31, 2016. Commencing in the first quarter of 2016, the CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 0.625% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 2.5% capital conservation buffer, and 1.125% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 4.5% GSIB surcharge. (b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s banking subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 0.625% resulting from the phase in of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer that is applicable to the banking subsidiaries. The banking subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d) Represents requirements for bank subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject. Note 29 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 15 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (d) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the U.S. portion of the contractual amount of total wholesale lending-related commitments was 79% and 77%, respectively. (e) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $143.2 billion and $190.6 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral consist of primarily cash and securities issued by governments that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and U.S. government agencies. (f) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, included unfunded commitments of $48 million and $50 million, respectively, to third-party private equity funds; and $1.0 billion and $871 million, respectively, to other equity investments. These commitments included $34 million and $73 million, respectively, related to investments that are generally fair valued at net asset value as discussed in Note 3. In addition, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, included letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis of $4.6 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. (g) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 257 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured clearance advance facilities that the Firm extends to its clients (i.e. cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the Firm’s intra-day credit risk to the facility amount and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For certain types of guarantees, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. For indemnifications provided in sales agreements, a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). Any contingent liability that exists as a result of issuing the guarantee or indemnification is recognized when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable. The contingent portion of the liability is not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of the liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $588 million and $550 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets; these carrying values included $147 million and $123 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $441 million and $427 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset. The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm’s customers, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 258 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Securities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s securities lending program, customers’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending customer with the cash equivalent thereof. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also include contracts such as stable value derivatives that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value derivatives, commonly referred to as “stable value wraps,” are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio and are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees are recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value in trading assets and trading liabilities. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $52.0 billion and $53.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $28.7 billion and $28.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $3.0 billion at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $96 million and $236 million and derivative receivables of $16 million and $14 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6. Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements, which are secured financing agreements. Such agreements settle at a future date. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly consist of agreements with regular-way settlement periods. For a further discussion of securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, and securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned, see Note 13. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs, as described in Note 16, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense. Private label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 31. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 259 Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $2.7 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $64 million and $82 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors, the Firm may enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that require the Firm to make a payment to them in the event of a change in tax law or an adverse interpretation of tax law. In certain cases, the contract also may include a termination clause, which would allow the Firm to settle the contract at its fair value in lieu of making a payment under the indemnification clause. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Card charge-backs Commerce Solutions, Card’s merchant services business, is a global leader in payment processing and merchant acquiring. Under the rules of Visa USA, Inc., and MasterCard International, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is primarily liable for the amount of each processed card sales transaction that is the subject of a dispute between a cardmember and a merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardmember’s favor, Commerce Solutions will (through the cardmember’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardmember and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Commerce Solutions is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Commerce Solutions will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardmember. Commerce Solutions mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or by obtaining other security. However, in the unlikely event that: (1) a merchant ceases operations and is unable to deliver products, services or a refund; (2) Commerce Solutions does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant to provide customer refunds; and (3) Commerce Solutions does not have sufficient financial resources to provide customer refunds, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., would recognize the loss. Commerce Solutions incurred aggregate losses of $85 million, $12 million, and $10 million on $1,063.4 billion, $949.3 billion, and $847.9 billion of aggregate volume processed for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Incurred losses from merchant charge-backs are charged to other expense, with the offset recorded in a valuation allowance against accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the valuation allowance was $45 million and $20 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which the Firm believes, based on historical experience and the collateral held by Commerce Solutions of $125 million and $136 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is representative of the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs. Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative transactions with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. Notes to consolidated financial statements 260 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin payables or receivables to clients and CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. For information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 6. Exchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to members who dealt with the defaulting member or to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 256 of this Note. For additional information, see Note 21. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 261 Note 30 – Commitments, pledged assets and collateral Lease commitments At December 31, 2016, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for banking purposes, and for energy-related tolling service agreements. Certain leases contain renewal options or escalation clauses providing for increased rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, or they require the Firm to perform restoration work on leased premises. No lease agreement imposes restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. The following table presents required future minimum rental payments under operating leases with noncancelable lease terms that expire after December 31, 2016. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 $ 1,598 2018 1,479 2019 1,301 2020 1,151 2021 885 After 2021 3,701 Total minimum payments required 10,115 Less: Sublease rentals under noncancelable subleases (1,379) Net minimum payment required $ 8,736 Total rental expense was as follows. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Gross rental expense $ 1,860 $ 2,015 $ 2,255 Sublease rental income (241) (411) (383) Net rental expense $ 1,619 $ 1,604 $ 1,872 Pledged assets The Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, and to cover customer short sales. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had pledged assets of $441.9 billion and $385.6 billion, respectively, at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had pledged $53.5 billion and $50.7 billion, respectively, of financial assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 16 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities and long-term debt, see Note 13 and Note 21, respectively. The significant components of the Firm’s pledged assets were as follows. December 31, (in billions) 2016 2015 Securities $ 101.1 $ 124.3 Loans 374.9 298.6 Trading assets and other 153.0 144.9 Total assets pledged $ 629.0 $ 567.8 Collateral At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $914.1 billion and $748.5 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $746.6 billion and $580.9 billion, respectively, were sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used. Collateral was generally used under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover customer short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. Notes to consolidated financial statements 262 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 31 – Litigation Contingencies As of December 31, 2016, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $3.0 billion at December 31, 2016. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. CIO Litigation. The Firm has been sued in a consolidated shareholder class action, and in a consolidated putative class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), relating to 2012 losses in the synthetic credit portfolio formerly managed by the Firm’s Chief Investment Office (“CIO”). A settlement of the shareholder class action, under which the Firm paid $150 million, has received full and final approval from the Court. The putative ERISA class action has been dismissed. That dismissal was affirmed by the appellate court, and a request by the plaintiffs for rehearing by the full appellate court was denied. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX- related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law, and in January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered shortly thereafter. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a temporary one- year waiver, which was effective upon entry of judgment, to allow the Firm and its affiliates to continue to qualify for the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under ERISA. The Firm’s application for a lengthier exemption is pending. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission announced that it had referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal to commence civil proceedings. The Firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.- based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the “U.S. class action”). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the “exchanged-based actions”), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”), participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the “ERISA actions”), and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions, and that agreement has been preliminarily approved by the Court. The District Court has dismissed one of the ERISA actions, and the plaintiffs have filed an appeal. The consumer action, a second ERISA action and the indirect purchaser action remain pending in the District Court. In September 2015, two class actions were filed in Canada against the Firm as well as a number of other FX dealers, principally for alleged violations of the Canadian Competition Act based on an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of currency purchased in the FX market. The first action was filed in the province of Ontario, and seeks to represent all persons in Canada who transacted any FX JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 263 instrument. The second action was filed in the province of Quebec, and seeks authorization to represent only those persons in Quebec who engaged in FX transactions. In late 2016, the Firm settled the Canadian class actions; those settlements are subject to Court approval. General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated Term Loan facility (“Term Loan”) for General Motors Corporation (“GM”). In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (“Creditors Committee”) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal of the Creditors Committee’s claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the Bankruptcy Court seeking indemnification and asserting various claims. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The parties entered into an agreement to settle the cases for a cash payment of $6.1 billion to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm’s share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight months to be measured from a date within 60 days of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provided for modifications to each credit card network’s rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. The case has been remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. Both the plaintiffs and the defendants have filed petitions seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court of the Second Circuit’s decision. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding. Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending two pending cases that are coordinated for pre-trial and trial purposes, alleging that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management (“JPMIM”) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited claim that JPMIM is liable for total losses of more than $1 billion in market value of these securities. Discovery has been completed. In January 2016, plaintiffs filed a joint partial motion for summary judgment in the coordinated actions. In February 2017, the Court ruled in plaintiffs’ favor as to the interpretation of an applicable statutory provision and the rejection of a certain defense, but otherwise preserved for trial the determination of whether JPMIM breached the governing contract and is liable for plaintiffs’ claimed losses under the standard of gross negligence. The trial is scheduled to begin in March 2017. Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In January 2016, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”) and several of LBHI’s subsidiaries reached an agreement, approved by the Bankruptcy Court, resolving several disputes between the parties. The January 2016 settlement did not resolve the following remaining matters: In the Bankruptcy Court proceedings, LBHI and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors filed an objection to the claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to clearing advances made to Lehman Brothers Inc., principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for its claims in a commercially reasonable manner. LBHI also brought two claims objections relating to securities lending claims and a group of other smaller claims. In January 2017, the Firm entered into an agreement to settle all of these remaining claims, and this settlement has been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Canadian Competition Bureau, the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Notes to consolidated financial statements 264 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”), as well as processes for the setting of U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. As previously reported, the Firm has resolved EC inquiries relating to Yen LIBOR and Swiss Franc LIBOR. In December 2016, the Firm resolved ComCo inquiries relating to these same rates. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal with the European General Court. In June 2016, the DOJ informed the Firm that the DOJ had closed its inquiry into LIBOR and other benchmark rates with respect to the Firm without taking action. Other inquiries have been discontinued without any action against JPMorgan Chase, including by the SEC, FCA and the Canadian Competition Bureau. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various United States District Courts. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, EURIBOR, Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (“SIBOR”), Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SOR”) and/or the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (“BBSW”) by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, EURIBOR, SIBOR, SOR or BBSW and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation. In the U.S. dollar LIBOR-related actions, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including the antitrust claims, and permitted other claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law to proceed. In May 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the dismissal of the antitrust claims and remanded the case to the District Court to consider, among other things, whether the plaintiffs have standing to assert antitrust claims. In July 2016, JPMorgan Chase and other defendants again moved in the District Court to dismiss the antitrust claims, and in December 2016, the District Court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion, finding that certain plaintiffs lacked standing to assert antitrust claims. Separately, in October 2016, JPMorgan Chase and other defendants filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Second Circuit’s decision that vacated the dismissal of plaintiffs’ antitrust claims. That petition was denied. The Firm is one of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. Plaintiffs primarily assert claims under the federal antitrust laws and Commodity Exchange Act. In April 2016, the Firm settled the ISDAFIX litigation, along with certain other banks. Those settlements have been preliminarily approved by the Court. Madoff Litigation. A putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., Madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested) in Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and were not included in a prior class action settlement. These plaintiffs allege violations of the federal securities law, as well as other state and federal claims. A similar action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, although it was not styled as a class action, and included claims pursuant to Florida statutes. The Florida court granted the Firm’s motion to dismiss the case, and in August 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal. The plaintiffs have filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. In addition, the same plaintiffs have re-filed their dismissed state claims in Florida state court, where the Firm’s motion to dismiss is pending. The New Jersey court granted a transfer motion to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which granted the Firm’s motion to dismiss, and the plaintiffs have filed an appeal of that dismissal. Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. The Firm and affiliates (together, “JPMC”), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, “Bear Stearns”) and certain Washington Mutual affiliates (together, “Washington Mutual”) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). Following the settlements referred to below, the remaining civil cases include one investor action, one action by a monoline insurer relating to Bear Stearns’ role solely as underwriter, and actions for repurchase of mortgage loans. The Firm and certain of its current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm’s MBS activities, and one action remains pending. Issuer Litigation – Individual Purchaser Actions. With the exception of one remaining action, the Firm has settled all of the individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings). Underwriter Actions. The Firm is defending one remaining action by a monoline insurer relating to Bear Stearns’ role solely as underwriter for another issuer’s MBS offering. The issuer is defunct. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 265 Repurchase Litigation. The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees, securities administrators and/ or master servicers of various MBS trusts on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys’ fees and costs and other remedies. The Firm has reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) in connection with the litigation related to a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation. In addition, the Firm and a group of 21 institutional MBS investors made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to 330 MBS trusts created between 2005 and 2008. The offer does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. The trustees (or separate and successor trustees) for this group of 330 trusts have accepted the settlement for 319 trusts in whole or in part and excluded from the settlement 16 trusts in whole or in part. The trustees’ acceptance has received final approval from the court. Additional actions have been filed against third-party trustees that relate to loan repurchase and servicing claims involving trusts sponsored by JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of MBS trustees or entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable statute of limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation. Derivative Actions. A shareholder derivative action against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors relating to the Firm’s MBS activities is pending in California federal court. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action. Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the DOJ’s Criminal Division and two United States Attorney’s Offices relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. In January 2017, a Consent Judgment was entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York resolving allegations by the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York that the Firm violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by giving pricing discretion to independent mortgage brokers in its wholesale lending distribution channel which, according to the government’s model, may have charged higher fees and interest rates to African-American and Hispanic borrowers than non- Hispanic White borrowers during the period between 2006 and 2009. The Firm denied liability but agreed to pay a total of approximately $55 million to resolve this matter. In addition, three municipalities have commenced litigation against the Firm alleging violations of an unfair competition law or the Fair Housing Act. The municipalities seek, among other things, civil penalties for the unfair competition claim, and, for the Fair Housing Act claims, damages resulting from lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. The municipal actions are stayed pending an appeal by the City of Los Angeles to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, as well as the United States Supreme Court’s review of decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit which held, among other things, that the City of Miami has standing under the Fair Housing Act to pursue similar claims against other banks. Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending. Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Notes to consolidated financial statements 266 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. In January 2017, the Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss an amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. Proprietary Products Investigations and Litigation. In December 2015, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to a settlement with the SEC, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. agreed to a settlement with the CFTC, regarding disclosures to clients concerning conflicts associated with the Firm’s sale and use of proprietary products, such as J.P. Morgan mutual funds, in the Firm’s CCB and AWM wealth management businesses, and the U.S. Private Bank’s disclosures concerning the use of hedge funds that pay placement agent fees to JPMorgan Chase broker-dealer affiliates. The Firm settled with an additional government authority in July 2016, and continues to cooperate with inquiries from other government authorities concerning disclosure of conflicts associated with the Firm’s sale and use of proprietary products. A putative class action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of financial advisory clients from 2007 to the present whose funds were invested in proprietary funds and who were charged investment management fees, was dismissed by the Court. The dismissal has been affirmed on appeal. Referral Hiring Practices Investigations. In November 2016, the Firm entered into settlements with DOJ, the SEC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) to resolve those agencies’ respective investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. Other related investigations are ongoing, and the Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations. Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual’s failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC and amended to include JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a defendant, asserting an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion in damages based upon alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with mortgage securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. In June 2015, the court ruled in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on the question of whether the Firm or the FDIC bears responsibility for Washington Mutual Bank’s repurchase obligations, holding that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. assumed only those liabilities that were reflected on Washington Mutual Bank’s financial accounting records as of September 25, 2008, and only up to the amount of the book value reflected therein. The FDIC has appealed that ruling. JPMorgan Chase has also filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC, in its corporate capacity as well as in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank, asserting multiple claims for indemnification under the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the FDIC relating to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s purchase of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank (the “Purchase & Assumption Agreement”). The Firm, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and the FDIC have signed a settlement agreement to resolve (i) pending litigation brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company against the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as defendants, relating to alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with mortgage securitization agreements and (ii) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s outstanding indemnification claims pursuant to the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement. The settlement is subject to certain judicial approval procedures, and both matters are stayed pending approval of the settlement. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi on November 30, 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. The Firm has been successful in legal challenges made to the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, which have been referred back to and remain pending before the Paris Court of Appeal. In addition, civil proceedings have been commenced against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. by a number of the managers. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 267 defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Firm’s legal expense was a benefit of $(317) million and an expense of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. Notes to consolidated financial statements 268 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Note 32 – International operations The following table presents income statement- and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 33. The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions) Revenue(b) Expense(c) Income before income tax expense Net income Total assets 2016 Europe/Middle East and Africa $ 13,842 $ 8,550 $ 5,292 $ 3,783 $ 394,134 (d) Asia and Pacific 6,112 4,213 1,899 1,212 156,946 Latin America and the Caribbean 1,959 1,632 327 208 42,971 Total international 21,913 14,395 7,518 5,203 594,051 North America(a) 73,755 46,737 27,018 19,530 1,896,921 Total $ 95,668 $ 61,132 $ 34,536 $ 24,733 $ 2,490,972 2015 Europe/Middle East and Africa $ 14,206 $ 8,871 $ 5,335 $ 4,158 $ 347,647 (d) Asia and Pacific 6,151 4,241 1,910 1,285 138,747 Latin America and the Caribbean 1,923 1,508 415 253 48,185 Total international 22,280 14,620 7,660 5,696 534,579 North America(a) 71,263 48,221 23,042 18,746 1,817,119 Total $ 93,543 $ 62,841 $ 30,702 $ 24,442 $ 2,351,698 2014 Europe/Middle East and Africa $ 16,013 $ 10,123 $ 5,890 $ 3,935 $ 481,328 (d) Asia and Pacific 6,083 4,478 1,605 1,051 147,357 Latin America and the Caribbean 2,047 1,626 421 269 44,567 Total international 24,143 16,227 7,916 5,255 673,252 North America(a) 70,969 48,186 22,783 16,490 1,899,022 Total $ 95,112 $ 64,413 $ 30,699 $ 21,745 $ 2,572,274 (a) Substantially reflects the U.S. (b) Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 270 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Segment results The following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments receiving tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/ (benefit).

Distribution of assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity; interest rates and interest differentials 274 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report Consolidated average balance sheet, interest and rates Provided below is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s consolidated average balances, interest rates and interest differentials on a taxable-equivalent basis for the years 2014 through 2016. Income computed on a taxable- equivalent basis is the income reported in the Consolidated statements of income, adjusted to present interest income and average rates earned on assets exempt from income taxes (primarily federal taxes) on a basis comparable with other taxable investments. The incremental tax rate used for calculating the taxable-equivalent adjustment was approximately 38% in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

ISDA: International Swaps and Derivatives Association JPMorgan Chase: JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association JPMorgan Clearing: J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. JPMorgan Securities: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Loan-equivalent: Represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn prior to an event of a default by an obligor. LCR: Liquidity coverage ratio LDA: Loss Distribution Approach LGD: Loss given default LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate LLC: Limited Liability Company LOB: Line of business Loss emergence period: Represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the realization of that loss. LTIP: Long-term incentive plan LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it Glossary of Terms and Acronyms 282 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis MMDA: Money Market Deposit Accounts Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage origination channels: Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties. Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm. Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas MSR: Mortgage servicing rights Multi-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class. NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. NAV: Net Asset Value Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge- offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes the following components: Operating revenue predominantly represents the return on Mortgage Servicing’s MSR asset and includes: – Actual gross income earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, such as contractually specified servicing fees and ancillary income; and – The change in the fair value of the MSR asset due to the collection or realization of expected cash flows. Risk management represents the components of Mortgage Servicing’s MSR asset that are subject to ongoing risk management activities, together with derivatives and other instruments used in those risk management activities. Net production revenue: Includes net gains or losses on originations and sales of mortgage loans, other production- related fees and losses related to the repurchase of previously sold loans.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NM: Not meaningful NOL: Net operating loss Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property. NOW: Negotiable Order of Withdrawal NSFR: Net stable funding ratio OAS: Option-adjusted spread OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss) OEP: One Equity Partners OIS: Overnight index swap OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit ORMF: Operational Risk Management Framework OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairment Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCA: Prompt corrective action PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PD: Probability of default PRA: Prudential Regulatory Authority Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Pretax margin: Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which management evaluates the performance of AWM against the performance of their respective competitors. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized Glossary of Terms and Acronyms 284 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives.

REITs can be publicly or privately held and they also qualify for certain favorable tax considerations. Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. REO: Real estate owned Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.

RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ROA: Return on assets ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced, both of which incorporate the requirements set forth in Basel 2.5. S&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 Index SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights SCCL: single-counterparty credit limits SEC: Securities and Exchange Commission Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment. Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the related mortgage, and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms JPMorgan Chase & Co./2016 Annual Report 285 corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.
