See following slide for reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures Q1 2025 Earnings Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow We provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet. ● Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. ● TTM free cash flow: We define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.
