The RCF Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $5.0 billion (the &#8220; Credit Facility &#8221;), which Tesla may draw upon from time to time. Tesla may increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion, subject to certain conditions, potentially increasing the Credit Facility to $7.0 billion.&#160;&#160;The Credit Facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit.&#160;&#160;The proceeds of the loans may be used for general corporate purposes or for any other purpose not otherwise prohibited by the RCF Credit Agreement.&#160;&#160;The Credit Facility terminates, and all outstanding loans, if any, become due and payable on January 20, 2028. Tesla may request up to two one-year extensions of the facility. No loans were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of January 25, 2023. Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: &#160; &#8226; for dollar-denominated loans, at the Company&#8217;s election, (a)&#160;Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b)&#160;an alternate base rate&#59; &#160; &#8226; for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate)&#59; or &#160; &#8226; for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR rate&#59; in each case, plus an applicable margin.&#160;&#160;The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to Tesla&#8217;s senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness from time to time. Tesla accrues a fee based on the daily unused portion of the Credit Facility.&#160;&#160;Such fee is also based on the rating assigned to Tesla&#8217;s senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness from time to time and is payable quarterly. The Credit Facility contains covenants that are usual for this type of facility. These covenants include, among others, restrictions on liens and the incurrence of debt by Tesla&#8217;s subsidiaries, each subject to exceptions and limitations. The Credit Facility also requires that Tesla maintain $1.0 billion of liquidity (as calculated pursuant to the RCF Credit Agreement). The Credit Facility contains customary events of default.
