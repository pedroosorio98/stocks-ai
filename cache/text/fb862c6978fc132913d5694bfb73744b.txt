The 2030 Notes, 2040 Notes, 2050 Notes and 2060 Notes are collectively referred to as the Notes. The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, conditions and covenants, including an agreement to indemnify the Underwriter against certain liabilities. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $4.97&#160;billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, repayment of indebtedness. The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. &#160;333-237390) and a related prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The above description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, attached as Exhibit 1.1 hereto, and incorporated herein by reference. Indenture The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September&#160;16, 2016, or the Base Indenture, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Trustee, as supplemented by an Officers&#8217; Certificate, dated as of March&#160;31, 2020. The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Officers&#8217; Certificate, is referred to as the Indenture. The 2030 Notes will mature on April&#160;1, 2030, the 2040 Notes will mature on April&#160;1, 2040, the 2050 Notes will mature on April&#160;1, 2050 and the 2060 Notes will mature on April&#160;1, 2060. Interest on the Notes is payable on April&#160;1 and October&#160;1 of each year, beginning on October&#160;1, 2020. Upon 30 days&#8217; notice to holders of the Notes, the Company may redeem the Notes for cash in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of (i)&#160;the 2030 Notes on or after January&#160;1, 2030, (ii) the 2040 Notes on or after October&#160;1, 2039, (iii) the 2050 Notes on or after October&#160;1, 2049, or (iv)&#160;the 2060 Notes on or after October&#160;1, 2059. The Indenture includes covenants limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to create liens on its properties, enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to its properties or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets, subject to a number of important exceptions as specified in the Indenture. The Indenture also contains customary event of default provisions. In the event of the occurrence of both (1)&#160;a change of control of the Company and (2)&#160;a downgrade of a series of Notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. and S&#038;P Global Ratings within a specified period relating to the applicable change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase any outstanding Notes of that series at a price in cash equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be repurchased to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Notes are the Company&#8217;s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company&#8217;s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.
