Dux maps how every vulnerability, asset, and control connects. Separating the merely reachable from the truly breachable. So you waste less time chasing noise, and have more time to secure where youâre actually at risk. Whatâs needed for the exploit? Can it actually be exploited? Where am I already protected?

Lightweight Mitigations Apply mitigations that get you to safety Not every gap needs a patch. Sometimes deploying a missing control or a config change will do. Thatâs why Dux scours your entire security posture, identifying lightweight mitigations you can deploy on your own. This empowers you to close critical gaps instantly, whether as a stopgap while waiting on a patch or a faster route to safety. Can I mitigate this quickly? What can I do with my existing stack? Am I still protected? Lightweight Mitigations Apply mitigations that get you to safety Not every gap needs a patch. Sometimes deploying a missing control or a config change will do.

Backed by Backed by Backed by CISOs will not turn over a rock to find another risk unless they have a solution for it. Dux solves the tale as old as time - too many vulns, not enough resources - allowing Cybersecurity teams to focus their finite resources where it matters most - on those exploits they are actually vulnerable to. Andrew Wilder, CSO at Vetcor, ex-NestlÃ© The biggest gap in exposure management today isnât a lack of data - itâs the inability to determine what actually matters amidst constant change. Dux closes that gap by focusing on exploitability, context, and the fastest path to safety. It transforms exposure management from reactive into a proactive defensive strategy. Rinki Sethi, CSO at Upwind, ex-BILL After nearly a decade in exposure management, determining true exploitability always felt like the holy grail - but out of reach. Dux is the first approach Iâve seen that uses modern AI to actually make it practical in real environments Mille Gandelsman CPO @ Opti, ex-VP at Tenable The reality today is that attackers move faster than traditional security workflows. Dux changes that dynamic by helping teams reason about exposure and respond at the pace modern threats demand.
