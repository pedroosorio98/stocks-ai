On August&nbsp;8, 2019, Broadcom Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Broadcom&#148;), and Symantec Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Symantec&#148;) entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Symantec&#146;s Enterprise Security business (the &#147;Business&#148;) for a purchase price of $10.7&nbsp;billion in cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). The Company and Symantec have made customary representations and warranties and agreed to customary covenants in the Purchase Agreement, including a covenant by Symantec to conduct the Business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice from the signing of the Purchase Agreement until the closing of the Transaction. The closing of the Transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of waiting periods required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of antitrust approvals in the European Union and Japan. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, following the closing of the Transaction, each party will have certain indemnification obligations, including with respect to breaches of covenants and for losses arising from certain assumed or retained liabilities, as applicable. The Purchase Agreement contains customary termination rights, including that either party may terminate the agreement if the closing of the Transaction has not occurred on or before February&nbsp;8, 2020, subject to a three-month extension in certain circumstances. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The Purchase Agreement and the foregoing description have been included to provide investors with information regarding the material terms of the Purchase Agreement. They are not intended to provide any other factual information about Broadcom or Symantec. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement have been made only for the purposes of the Purchase Agreement and solely for the benefit of the parties thereto, and for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Purchase Agreement instead of establishing matters of fact. In addition, they may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to investors as well as qualifications and limitations agreed upon by the parties in connection with the negotiated terms of the Purchase Agreement, including qualifications in confidential disclosure schedules. In addition, such representations and warranties were made only as of the dates specified in the Purchase Agreement and information regarding the subject matter thereof may change after that date. Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding its terms and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding Broadcom, Symantec, or the Business as of the date of the Purchase Agreement or as of any other date. &nbsp; Item&nbsp;7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
