On April&#160;30, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. issued a press release announcing the Company&#8217;s earnings for the first quarter ended March&#160;31, 2022. A copy of this press release is furnished with this report as an exhibit to this Form 8-K. &#160; ITEM&#160;5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year &#160; &#160; (a) On May&#160;1, 2022, the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), amended the Company&#8217;s Bylaws effective immediately to restate Section&#160;12 &#8211; Forum for Adjudication of Disputes. The restatement of Section&#160;12 updates certain provisions regarding the forum to be used for adjudicating derivative claims, in particular, to require adjudication of derivative claims over which the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction in the federal district court for the District of Delaware, and adds a federal forum selection provision requiring the adjudication of claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933 in a U.S. federal district court, unless in each case the Company consents otherwise in writing. The prior version of Section&#160;12 required that all derivative claims, among others, be adjudicated in the Delaware Court of Chancery unless the Company consented otherwise in writing and did not address forum selection for claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, the restatement of Section&#160;12 made certain changes primarily to conform to updates in Delaware law. The foregoing description of the amendment to the Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, attached hereto as Exhibit 3(ii) and incorporated herein by reference. &#160; ITEM&#160;5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders On April&#160;30, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. held an annual meeting of its shareholders.
