This past fiscal year offered another record year for financial performance, and Microsoft delivered strong results for our shareholders, including a return of $30.9&nbsp;billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We celebrate these successes and look forward to more opportunity ahead as we remain committed to the long-term interests of Microsoft shareholders. This year&#146;s Board nominees represent a wide range of backgrounds and expertise. We believe our diversity of experiences, perspectives, and skills contributes to the Board&#146;s effectiveness in managing risk and providing guidance that positions Microsoft for long-term success in a dynamically changing business environment. Of our 13 Board nominees, 11 are independent, which includes our Board Chair and all Committee members. As part of our ongoing commitment to creating a balanced and effective Board with diverse viewpoints and deep industry expertise, we regularly add new directors to infuse new ideas and fresh perspectives in the boardroom. We are pleased to announce the nomination of Emma Walmsley for election to the Board at our December&nbsp;4, 2019 Annual Meeting. Ms.&nbsp;Walmsley is CEO of GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) and member of the GSK board. She is an accomplished business leader who drove major advances in research and development at GSK and will bring significant insights and global experience to Microsoft. Charles H. Noski and Helmut Panke have decided that after almost 16 years of service, they will not seek re-election and will end their Board service in December. They have been critical and insightful directors during multiple key moments for Microsoft for more than a decade and a half, and we are grateful for their many contributions. This Proxy Statement describes Microsoft&#146;s corporate governance policies and practices that foster the Board&#146;s effective oversight of the Company&#146;s business strategies and practices. We encourage you to view our director video series to bring this information to life. The videos provide an opportunity for directors to discuss how we approach our roles and responsibilities and share the unique perspectives we bring to the Board. The series is available at https://aka.ms/DirectorVideoSeries . Beyond communicating our perspectives, we also believe in the value of listening to our shareholders. During fiscal year 2019, our Board Chair and members of management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning over 49% of Microsoft shares. Over the past several years, feedback from shareholders has helped the Board evolve Microsoft&#146;s executive compensation program and further enhance shareholder rights. Shareholder feedback also helps us prioritize our efforts and enhance our transparency on workplace issues and other topics. As we look to the year ahead, we remain excited about the opportunities Microsoft has in terms of its business, shareholder value creation, and positive impacts at a global scale. Thank you for the trust you place in us and the opportunity to serve you and our Company as directors.

We received 96% say-on-pay vote support at our 2018 Annual Meeting. Our Compensation Committee believes the vote indicates support for our program. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay&nbsp;for&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We&nbsp;have executed on our pay for performance philosophy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;55% of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives was performance-based (on average). &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;50% of the annual cash incentive is determined based on pre-established financial targets, and the other 50% is determined qualitatively based on performance in three weighted performance categories. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;The metrics for our performance stock awards are reviewed annually to ensure they reflect key business developments that drive long-term growth. &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Our performance stock awards include a relative total shareholder return (&#147;TSR&#148;) multiplier to reward significant positive outperformance and align executives&#146; and shareholders&#146; long-term interests. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;At&nbsp;least 70% of target compensation for our&nbsp;Named Executives was equity-based, providing incentives to drive long-term business success and direct alignment&nbsp;with returns to shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See Part 2 &#150; Named Executive Officer Compensation for more information. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound&nbsp;Program&nbsp;Design&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We design our executive officer compensation programs to attract, motivate, and retain the key executives who drive our success and industry leadership, while considering individual and Company&nbsp;performance and alignment with the long-term interests of our shareholders. We achieve our objectives through compensation that: &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Provides a competitive total pay opportunity. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Delivers a majority of pay based on performance. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Consists primarily of stock-based compensation. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Enhances long-term focus through multi-year vesting of stock awards. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk&nbsp;taking. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best&nbsp;Practices&nbsp;in&nbsp;Executive&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our leading practices include: &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;No excessive perquisites (no executive-only club memberships or medical benefits) or tax gross-ups. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;No employment contracts or change in control benefits. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;A strong clawback policy. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;A robust executive stock ownership policy. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;A policy prohibiting pledging and hedging ownership of Microsoft stock. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;No executive-only retirement programs. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;3 Table of Contents &nbsp; Business Overview Our Business Performance In fiscal year 2019, we continued to achieve strong business results, focusing on enabling the success and earning the trust of our customers.

Our adoption of leading governance practices fosters our sustained business success over the long term. Strong corporate governance, informed by participation from our shareholders, is essential to achieving our mission. During fiscal year 2019, independent members of our Board and members of management conducted outreach to a cross-section of shareholders owning over 49% of our shares and provided shareholder feedback to the Board. &nbsp; 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Our Board believes that having a diverse mix of directors with complementary qualifications, expertise, and attributes is essential to meeting its oversight responsibility. Of our 13 Board nominees, 11 are independent. Having an independent board is a core element of our governance philosophy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Nominees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent,&nbsp;Effective&nbsp;Board&nbsp;Oversight&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Independent Board Chair. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;11 of 13 director nominees are independent. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;All committee members are independent. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Board-adopted refreshment commitment to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Executive sessions provided for all in-person Board and committee meetings. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Annual Board and committee evaluations. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Director orientation and continuing education programs for directors. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;All current Audit Committee members are audit committee financial experts under the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) rules. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Independent compensation consultant. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholder&nbsp;Rights&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Single class of stock with equal voting rights. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;All directors are elected annually. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Directors are elected by majority vote in uncontested elections. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Confidential voting policy. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;15% of outstanding shares can call a special meeting. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Our bylaws provide for proxy access by shareholders. &nbsp; See Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors for more information. &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;5 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Governance and Our Board of Directors &nbsp; &nbsp; Trust and Governance We believe that earning the trust of our customers, partners, shareholders, and other stakeholders is a foundation of our business success and is fundamental to realizing Microsoft&#146;s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our focus on earning trust positions us well as technology companies face new scrutiny and demands for accountability. The technology sector faces greater expectations than ever from governments and other stakeholders to address the impacts of technology on individual rights, cybersecurity, and environmental sustainability. Customers embrace technology they understand and trust, and we expect they will increasingly turn away from products and companies that fail to uphold that trust. Governments and investors are increasingly focused on the importance of the effective engagement and action on environmental, social, and governance (&#147;ESG&#148;) topics. To meet the expectations of our stakeholders and to earn and maintain their trust, we are committed to conducting our business in ways that are principled, transparent, and accountable. The foundation of these commitments is expressed in Microsoft&#146;s Standards of Business Conduct (&#147;Standards&#148;) at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/sbc/ which apply to our employees, officers, Board of Directors, and our subsidiaries and controlled affiliates across the globe. These Standards require not only legal compliance, but also broader commitments to address accessibility, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and privacy. In support of these Standards, we strive to build a workplace culture that embraces learning and fosters trust&#151;a culture where every employee feels free to ask questions and raise concerns when something doesn&#146;t seem right. We extend our high expectations to suppliers who do business with Microsoft, requiring them to uphold the human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental, and business ethics practices prescribed in our Supplier Code of Conduct at http://aka.ms/scoc . In addition, we have made a broad range of commitments on issues of significant concern to the public, including privacy, security, and environmental sustainability. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right and demonstrate our belief with concrete actions to protect our customer&#146;s privacy and give them control over their data. We take a broad view of cybersecurity and work to protect our customers and the wider community through our own security operations, the security products and services we offer, and our investments in technology, industry, and policy partnerships. As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, we&#146;ve achieved carbon neutrality for our global operations every year since 2012. In 2019, we also set our next milestone on the path to powering our datacenters with 100% renewable energy, aiming to surpass a 70% target by 2023. We also aim to hold ourselves accountable by publicly reporting on our policies, practices, and performance to provide our stakeholders visibility into how we are meeting our commitments and responsibilities. Our Reports Hub available at www.microsoft.com/transparency provides a consolidated, comprehensive view of our ESG reporting and data ranging from our carbon footprint to workforce demographics to political donations. We work to align our ESG reporting to global standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards. In addition, we were among the first companies to align our human rights work with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to adopt the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Our commitment to strong corporate governance and effective board oversight plays a critical role in ensuring accountability and earning trust. Below we describe Microsoft&#146;s corporate governance policies and practices that foster effective Board oversight in service of the long-term interests of our shareholders, explain the process for selecting director candidates, and present the 2019 nominees for election to our Board. &nbsp; &nbsp; Board of Directors Oversight Roles Shareholders elect our Board to serve their long-term interests and to oversee management. Our Board and its committees work closely with management to provide oversight, review, and counsel related to long-term strategy, risks and opportunities, and feedback from shareholders. In particular, the Board oversees business affairs and integrity, works with management to determine our mission and long-term strategy, oversees risk management, performs the annual CEO evaluation, oversees CEO succession planning, and oversees internal control over financial reporting and external audit. The Board looks to the expertise of its &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; committees to provide strategic oversight in their areas of focus. Examples of oversight areas are provided below and further below we describe the Board&#146;s committee structure and each committee&#146;s areas of focus and oversight. Strategy Led by the CEO, the Senior Leadership Team (&#147;SLT&#148;) drives Microsoft&#146;s strategy and operations and works to develop and execute business strategy, foster our desired culture, create innovative products, establish accountability, and control risk. The SLT also aligns our structure, operations, people, policies, and compliance efforts to our mission and strategy. Overseeing management&#146;s development and execution of the Company&#146;s strategy is one of our Board&#146;s primary responsibilities. The Board works closely with the SLT to respond to a dynamically changing business environment. The SLT and other leaders from across the Company provide business and strategy updates to our Board quarterly, and the Board participates in an annual strategy retreat with the SLT and other leaders. At meetings throughout the year, the Board also assesses the strategic alignment of the Company&#146;s budget and capital plan and strategic acquisition and integration process. For large acquisitions such as LinkedIn and GitHub, the Board engages management on a broad range of considerations, such as due diligence findings, valuation, and integration planning. Risk Microsoft&#146;s Corporate Governance Guidelines at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines describe our Board&#146;s risk oversight roles. The Board and the Audit Committee assess whether management has an appropriate framework to manage risks and whether that framework is operating effectively. On a regular basis, the Board and its committees engage with management on risk as part of broad strategic and operational discussions which encompass interrelated risks, as well as on a risk-by-risk basis. The Board executes its oversight responsibility directly and through its committees, who regularly report back to the Board. For information on specific areas of risk oversight, each committee has a charter describing its specific responsibilities which can be found on our website at https://aka.ms/boardcommittees . The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company and other risk areas not delegated to one of its committees. We believe that the Board&#146;s leadership structure, including its independent chair, supermajority of independent directors, and allocation of oversight responsibilities to appropriate committees, provides effective board-level risk oversight. Culture, Workplace, and Succession Planning We focus on creating a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that allows our employees to build meaningful careers. Key to this environment is cultivating a growth mindset, where our workforce is focused on learning, listening, and growing. We have established a set of five &#147;People Priorities&#148; that ground our Human Resource strategy: talent that can change the world, an evolving culture with a growth mindset, an exceptional place to work, transformational leadership, and empowering at scale. Each SLT member serves as a &#147;sponsor&#148; for one or more of the priorities and all are accountable to help achieve them. We consider employee input from our annual anonymous poll and other feedback channels in designing talent programs, rewards, and benefits, and building the overall employee experience. The Board, the Compensation Committee, and the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee engage with the SLT and Human Resources executives across a broad range of human capital management topics including culture, succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, employee recruiting and retention, and diversity and inclusion. Additionally, each year the Compensation and Audit Committees evaluate management&#146;s annual assessment of risk related to our compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee also oversees our sales incentive programs through engagement with management&#146;s Sales Incentive Compensation Governance Committee. The Board and the Compensation Committee work with the CEO and our head of Human Resources to review CEO and senior executive succession plans, considering the qualifications and experience of potential leadership candidates. &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Governance Structure Framework We have developed a corporate governance framework designed to ensure our Board has the authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business operations and to make decisions independent of management. Our goal is to align the interests of directors, management, and shareholders, and comply with or exceed the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) and applicable laws and regulations. This framework establishes the practices our Board follows with respect to, among other things, Board composition and member selection, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, director &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;7 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compensation, CEO performance evaluation, management succession planning, and Board committees. The Board is committed to seeking opportunities for improvements on an ongoing basis. Each spring, the Board updates our corporate governance framework based on shareholder feedback, results from the annual shareholders meeting, the Board and committees&#146; self-assessments, governance best practices, and regulatory developments. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Corporate&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;Documents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation &#149;&#8194;Bylaws &#149;&#8194;Corporate Governance Guidelines &#149;&#8194;Director Independence Guidelines &#149;&#8194;Microsoft Finance Code of Professional Conduct &#149;&#8194;Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct &#149;&#8194;Audit&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;Charter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Responsibilities&nbsp;Calendar &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Compensation Committee Charter &#149;&#8194;Governance and Nominating Committee Charter &#149;&#8194;Regulatory and Public Policy Committee Charter &#149;&#8194;Executive Stock Ownership Policy &#149;&#8194;Executive Compensation Recovery Policy &#149;&#8194;Compensation Consultant Independence Standards These documents are available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Shareholder Rights Microsoft strives to implement best practices in shareholder rights and to ensure the Company and Board align with the long-term interests of shareholders. We have enhanced our corporate governance framework over time based on input from our Board, shareholders, and other governance experts. Shareholder rights provided include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Single class of shares with each share entitled to one vote. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Annual election of all directors (unclassified board). &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Majority voting standard for directors in uncontested elections. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Confidential voting policy. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Shareholders of 15% of outstanding shares have the right to call a special meeting. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Proxy access bylaw allows groups of up to 20 shareholders holding 3% of shares for at least three years to nominate up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater) for inclusion in the proxy statement and ballot for election at an annual shareholders meeting. Other requirements that align Company and long-term interests of shareholders include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Significant stock ownership requirements for directors, executive officers, and other senior leaders. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Strong &#145;no-fault&#146; executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy that applies to executive officers, other senior leaders, and our chief accounting officer. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Strict hedging and pledging prohibitions against our directors and executive officers hedging their ownership of Microsoft stock, including by trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to Company stock or debt. Directors and executive officers are prohibited from purchasing Microsoft stock on margin, borrowing against Microsoft stock held in a margin account, or pledging Microsoft stock as collateral for a loan. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Board tenure policy that seeks to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for the Board&#146;s independent directors. Shareholder Engagement Effective corporate governance includes regular constructive conversations with our shareholders to proactively seek shareholder insights and to answer shareholder inquiries. We maintain an active dialogue with shareholders to ensure a diversity of perspectives is thoughtfully considered on issues including strategy, business performance, risk, culture and workplace topics, compensation practices, and a broad range of ESG issues. Our Office of the Corporate Secretary coordinates engagement with Investor Relations and provides a summary of all relevant feedback to our Board . In fiscal year 2019, our Board Chair and members of management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning over 49% of Microsoft shares. In addition, throughout the year our Investor Relations group engages with our &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shareholders, frequently along with Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, our CEO, or Ms.&nbsp;Hood, our CFO. As noted above, each spring the Board updates our corporate governance framework based on a number of inputs including shareholder feedback. To communicate broadly with our shareholders, we also seek to transparently share ESG information relevant to our shareholders through our Investor Relations website, our Annual Report, this Proxy Statement, our Reports Hub, and in posts about Microsoft On the Issues blog. We are proud to have helped pioneer a director video series that gives shareholders and other stakeholders insight into the thinking of our Board members. We recently released a new installment featuring an interview with Hugh Johnston. The videos provide an opportunity for our directors to discuss how they approach their role and responsibilities and to provide a behind-the-scenes look into the boardroom. The series can be viewed on our website at https://aka.ms/DirectorVideoSeries . Annual Board and Committee Evaluation Process The Board is committed to a rigorous self-evaluation process. The Governance and Nominating Committee annually evaluates the performance of the Board. The evaluation includes feedback from each director, and the results are reported to and discussed with the Board. The report includes an assessment of the Board&#146;s compliance with the principles in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and identifies areas in which the Board could enhance its performance. In addition, each committee annually evaluates its performance and reports the results to the Board. For each committee, the evaluation includes feedback from directors, as well as key members of management and consultants who regularly attend the meetings. Each committee&#146;s report includes an assessment of the committee&#146;s compliance with the principles in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and its charter and identifies areas in which the committee could enhance its performance. Results requiring additional review or consideration are discussed at subsequent Board and committee meetings. Director Attendance Each quarter, our Board holds two-day in-person meetings. Committee meetings occur the first day before the Board meeting. Once a year, committee and Board meetings occur on the same day so that the evening and following day can be devoted to the Board&#146;s annual strategy retreat, which includes presentations and discussions with our SLT and other senior management about our long-term strategy. In addition to the quarterly meetings, typically there are other regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings and several special meetings each year. At each quarterly Board meeting, time is set aside for the independent directors to meet without management present. Our Board met five times during fiscal year 2019. Each director nominee who is a current director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all fiscal year 2019 meetings of the Board and each committee on which he or she served. Directors are expected to attend the annual shareholders meeting, if practicable. All directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. Director Orientation and Continuing Education Our orientation program familiarizes new directors with our businesses, strategies, and policies and assists new directors in developing Company and industry knowledge to optimize their service on the Board. Regular continuing education programs enhance the skills and knowledge directors use to perform their responsibilities. These programs may include internally developed programs, programs presented by third parties, or financial and administrative support to attend qualifying academic or other independent programs. Director Stock Ownership Policy To align the interests of our directors and shareholders, our directors are required to own Microsoft shares equal in value to at least three times the base annual retainer (cash and stock) payable to a director. Each director must retain 50% of all net shares (post-tax) from the retainer until reaching the minimum share ownership requirement. Stock deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors counts toward the minimum ownership requirement. Each of our directors complied with our stock ownership policy in fiscal year 2019. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;9 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivatives Trading, Hedging, and Pledging Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to Microsoft equity or debt securities. They also are prohibited from purchasing Microsoft common stock on margin, borrowing against Microsoft common stock held in a margin account, or pledging Microsoft common stock as collateral for a loan. Employees, other than executive officers, are generally permitted to engage in transactions designed to hedge or offset market risk. Board Independence Having an independent board is a core element of our governance philosophy. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our directors will be independent. The independent members of the Board annually appoint an independent Board Chair to facilitate the Board&#146;s oversight of management, promote communication between management and our Board, engage with shareholders, and lead consideration of key governance matters. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Elements&nbsp;of&nbsp;Board&nbsp;Independence&nbsp;at&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; 11 of 13 director nominees are independent &#150; We are committed to maintaining a substantial majority of directors who are independent of the Company and management. Except for our CEO, Satya Nadella, and our co-founder, Bill Gates, all director nominees are independent. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Board tenure &#150; We are committed to board refreshment. To strike a balance between retaining directors with deep knowledge of the Company and adding directors with a fresh perspective, the Board will seek to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Executive sessions of independent directors &#150; At each quarterly Board meeting, time is set aside for the independent directors to meet in executive session without management present. Additional executive sessions are held as needed. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Committee independence &#150; Only independent directors are members of the Board&#146;s committees. Each committee meets regularly in executive session. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Independent compensation consultant &#150; The compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee is independent of the Company and management as required by the Compensation Consultant Independence Standards. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Independent Board Chair &#150; John Thompson currently serves as independent Chair of the Board. Key responsibilities include: &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Calling meetings of the Board and independent directors. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Setting the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with other directors, the CEO, and the Corporate Secretary. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Chairing executive sessions and coordinating activities of the independent directors. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Leading the Board&#146;s annual CEO performance evaluation. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;When requested, representing the Board with internal and external audiences including shareholders. &nbsp; Board Committees To support effective corporate governance, our Board delegates certain responsibilities to its committees, who report on their activities to the Board. These committees have the authority to engage legal counsel or other advisors or consultants as they deem appropriate to carry out their responsibilities. Our Board has an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee, and Regulatory and Public Policy Committee. In addition, our Regulatory and Public Policy Committee holds joint meetings with both the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee on areas of complementary responsibility. The table below provides summary information about each director nominee followed by a summary of each committee&#146;s responsibilities. Each committee has a charter describing its specific responsibilities which can be found on our website at https://aka.ms/boardcommittees . &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Membership &nbsp; Director &nbsp;&nbsp; Audit &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;and Nominating &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory&nbsp;and Public Policy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; William H.

The Committee may delegate its authority to subcommittees and to one or more designated members of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to one or more executive officers the authority to make grants of equity-based compensation to eligible individuals who are not executive officers and to administer the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation plans. The Committee has delegated to senior management the authority to make stock award grants to employees who are not members of the SLT or Section&nbsp;16 officers and to administer the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation plans. &nbsp; Independent compensation consultant &#150; The Compensation Committee retains Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC (&#147;Semler Brossy&#148;) to advise the Committee on marketplace trends in executive compensation, management proposals for compensation programs, and executive officer compensation decisions. Semler Brossy also evaluates compensation for non-employee directors, the next levels of senior management, and equity compensation programs generally. Semler Brossy consults with the Committee about its recommendations to the Board on CEO compensation. Semler Brossy is directly accountable to the Committee. To maintain the independence of the firm&#146;s advice, Semler Brossy does not provide any services for Microsoft other than those described above. The Committee has adopted Compensation Consultant Independence Standards, which can be viewed on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . These standards require that the Committee annually assess the independence of its compensation consultant. A consultant satisfying the following requirements will be considered independent. The consultant (including each individual employee of the consultant providing services): &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Is retained and terminated by, has its compensation fixed by, and reports solely to, the Compensation Committee. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Is independent of the Company. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Will not perform any work for Company management except at the request of the Compensation Committee chair and in the capacity of the Committee&#146;s agent. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Should not provide any unrelated services or products to the Company and its affiliates or management, except for surveys purchased from the consultant&#146;s firm. &nbsp; In assessing the consultant&#146;s independence, the Compensation Committee considers the nature and amount of work performed for the Committee during the year, the nature of any unrelated services performed for the Company, and the fees paid for those services in relation to the firm&#146;s total revenues. The consultant annually prepares for the Committee an independence letter providing assurances and confirmation of the consultant&#146;s independent status under the standards. The Committee believes that Semler Brossy has been independent during its service for the Committee. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nominating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Determine and recommend the slate of director nominees for election to our Board during the annual meeting. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Identify, recruit, and recommend candidates for the Board. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Review and make recommendations to the Board about the composition of Board committees. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Annually evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Board. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Annually assess the independence of each director. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Monitor adherence to, review, develop, and recommend changes to our corporate governance framework. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Review and provide guidance to the Board and management about the framework for the Board&#146;s oversight of, and involvement in, shareholder engagement. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Annually review the charters of Board committees and, after consultation with the respective committees, make recommendations, if necessary, about changes to the charters. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regulatory&nbsp;and&nbsp;Public&nbsp;Policy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Review and advise the Board and management about legal, regulatory, and compliance matters concerning competition and antitrust, privacy, workforce, and immigration laws and regulations. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;With the Audit Committee, review risks relevant to our information system architecture and controls and cybersecurity.

In making its annual director nominations determination, the Board&#146;s objective is to recommend a group of directors that can best ensure the continuing success of our business and represent shareholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience and perspectives. The Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board director candidates for nomination and election during the annual shareholders meeting or for appointment to fill vacancies. The Committee works with our Board to determine the characteristics, skills, and experience for the Board as a whole and its individual members with the objective of having a board with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experience. In making its recommendations to our Board, the Committee considers the qualifications of individual director candidates applying the Board membership criteria described below. The Committee retains any search firm involved in identifying potential candidates and approves their fees. For all directors, we require independence, integrity, personal and professional ethics, business judgment, and the ability and willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board. Our Board considers many factors in evaluating the suitability of individual director candidates, including their general understanding of global business, sales and marketing, finance, and other disciplines relevant to the success of a large, publicly traded company; understanding of our business and technology; educational and professional background; personal accomplishment; and national, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which new candidates are selected. We work with our search firm to ensure the candidate slate provided to the Committee includes diverse candidates. The Board does not believe that directors should expect to be re-nominated annually. In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, the Committee considers the director&#146;s participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the results of the most recent Board evaluation, and meeting attendance. When the Committee recruits new director candidates, that process typically involves either a search firm or a member of the Committee contacting a prospect to assess interest and availability. A candidate will then meet with members of the Board and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, and then meet with members of management as appropriate. At the same time, the Committee and the search firm will contact references for the candidate. A background check is completed before a final candidate recommendation is made to the Board. Shareholders previously elected all Board nominees, except Ms.&nbsp;Walmsley. In recruiting Ms.&nbsp;Walmsley, the Committee retained the search firm Egon Zehnder to help identify director prospects, perform candidate outreach, assist in reference checks, and provide other related services. The Committee assesses its efforts to maintain an effective and diverse board as part of its regular responsibilities, which include annually: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reporting to our Board on the performance and effectiveness of the Board. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Presenting to our Board individuals recommended for election to the Board during the annual meeting. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Assessing the Committee&#146;s own performance. Shareholder Recommendations and Nominations of Director Candidates Recommendations The Governance and Nominating Committee considers shareholder recommendations for candidates for the Board of Directors using the same criteria described above. The name of any recommended candidate for director, together with a brief biographical sketch, a document indicating the candidate&#146;s willingness to serve if elected, and evidence of the nominating shareholder&#146;s ownership of Company stock must be sent to the attention of MSC 123/9999, Office of the Corporate Secretary, Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052-6399. Nominations Our Bylaws provide for proxy access shareholder nominations of director candidates by eligible shareholders.

Communications relating to other topics, including those that are primarily commercial in nature, will not be forwarded. &nbsp; @ &nbsp; &nbsp; askboard@microsoft.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MSC&nbsp;123/9999 Office&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Corporate&nbsp;Secretary Microsoft Corporation One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052-6399 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerns about accounting or auditing matters or possible violations of our Standards of Business Conduct should be reported under the procedures outlined in the Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct, which is available on our Microsoft integrity website at www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/integrity . Director Independence Guidelines Our Board has adopted director independence guidelines to assist in determining each director&#146;s independence. These guidelines are available on our website at https://aka.ms/directorindependence . The guidelines either meet or are more restrictive than the definition of &#147;independent director&#148; in the listing requirements of NASDAQ and applicable laws and regulations. The guidelines identify categories of relationships the Board has determined would not affect a director&#146;s independence and therefore are not considered by the Board in determining director independence. Following the director independence guidelines, each year and before a new director is appointed, the Board must affirmatively determine a director has no relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. Annually, each director completes a detailed questionnaire that provides information about relationships that might affect the determination of independence. Management provides the Governance and Nominating Committee and Board with relevant known facts and circumstances of any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee that is outside the categories permitted under the director independence guidelines. The Committee then completes an assessment of each director considering all known relevant facts and circumstances concerning any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee. This process includes evaluating whether any identified relationship otherwise adversely affects a director&#146;s independence and affirmatively determining that the director has no material relationship with Microsoft, another director, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company. The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers the tenure of a director, and for longer serving directors, whether the duration of service impacts the director&#146;s independence from management, as demonstrated by the director&#146;s relationship with management and the director&#146;s participation in Board and committee deliberations. The Board seeks to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. Based on the review and recommendation by the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board analyzed the independence of each director and nominee. The Board determined that Mses. List-Stoll, Peterson, Pritzker, Walmsley, and Warrior, Messrs. Hoffman, Johnston, Noski, Scharf, Sorenson, Stanton, and Thompson, and Dr.&nbsp;Panke meet the standards of independence under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the director independence guidelines, and applicable NASDAQ listing standards, including that each member is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions We are a global company with extensive operations in the United States and many foreign countries. Every year, we spend billions of dollars for goods and services purchased from third parties. The authority of our employees to purchase goods and services is widely dispersed. Because of these wide-ranging activities, there may be transactions and business arrangements with businesses and other organizations in which one of our directors, executive officers, or nominees for director, or their immediate families, or an owner of greater than 5% of our stock, may also be a director, executive officer, or investor, or have some other direct or indirect material interest (&#147;related entities&#148;). We will refer to these transactions with related entities as related-party transactions where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a director, executive officer, or immediate family member has a direct or indirect material interest. Related-party transactions have the potential to create actual or perceived conflicts of interest between Microsoft and its directors, executive officers, or their immediate family members. The Audit Committee has established a written policy and procedures for &nbsp; &nbsp; 24 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; review and approval of related-party transactions. If a related-party transaction subject to review involves directly or indirectly a member of the Audit Committee (or an immediate family member or domestic partner), the remaining Committee members will conduct the review. In evaluating a related-party transaction, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The goods or services provided by or to the related party. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The nature of the transaction and the costs to be incurred by Microsoft or payments to Microsoft. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The benefits associated with the transaction and whether comparable or alternative goods or services are available to Microsoft from unrelated parties. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The business advantage Microsoft would gain by engaging in the transaction. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The significance of the transaction to Microsoft and to the related party. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Management&#146;s determination that the transaction is in the best interests of Microsoft. To receive Audit Committee approval, a related-party transaction must have a Microsoft business purpose and be on terms that are fair and reasonable to Microsoft and be as favorable to Microsoft as would be available from non-related entities in comparable transactions. The Audit Committee also requires that the transaction meet the same Microsoft standards that apply to comparable transactions with unaffiliated entities. During fiscal year 2019, there were transactions between Microsoft and certain related entities, for instance the purchase of software licenses by companies of which a director is an executive officer. None of these transactions constituted a related-party transaction that required approval by the Audit Committee. &nbsp; &nbsp; Director Compensation The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the regular annual retainer paid to non-employee directors and makes recommendations for adjustments, as appropriate, to the Board. We have not increased director pay since fiscal year 2015. As our CEO, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella does not receive additional pay for serving as a director. Mr.&nbsp;Gates has waived his cash and stock awards. &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2019 Compensation Structure for Directors &nbsp; Regular Retainers (all directors except Messrs. Gates, Nadella, and Thompson) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Annual Base Retainer (TOTAL) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $325,000 &nbsp; Cash &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $125,000 &nbsp; Stock Award &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $200,000 &nbsp; Annual Committee Chair Retainer &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $15,000 &nbsp; Annual Audit Committee Chair Retainer &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $45,000 &nbsp; Annual Audit Committee Non-Chair Member Retainer &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $15,000 &nbsp; Independent Board Chair Retainer &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Annual Independent Chair Retainer (TOTAL &#150; in lieu of other retainers) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $537,500 &nbsp; Cash &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $125,000 &nbsp; Stock Award &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $412,500 &nbsp; The Company reimburses reasonable expenses incurred for Board-related activities. Directors may participate in our corporate matching gift program for charitable donations. Director retainers are paid quarterly in arrears. Quarterly periods are measured beginning with the annual meeting. At the end of each quarterly period, we pay 25% of the total annual retainer to each director. The number of shares awarded each quarterly period is determined by dividing the dollar value of the stock award by the market price of our common stock as of the last business day of the period. Retainers are pro-rated for directors who join or leave the Board or have a change in Board role during a quarterly period. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;25 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Directors may elect to defer and convert to deferred stock awards all or part of their annual cash retainer, and to defer receipt of all or part of their annual stock awards retainer under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Amounts deferred are maintained in bookkeeping accounts that are deemed invested in Microsoft common stock, and dividends paid on deemed investment are also deemed to be invested in our common stock. We calculate the number of shares credited by dividing the amount deferred by the closing market price of our common stock on the originally scheduled payment date. Accounts in the plan are distributed in shares of Microsoft common stock, with payments either in installments beginning on separation from Board service or in a lump sum paid no later than the fifth anniversary after separation from Board service. Fiscal Year 2019 Director Compensation This table describes the cash and stock award portions of the annual retainer paid to each non-employee director who served in fiscal year 2019.

Our multi-year effort to transform our executive pay program is grounded in a compensation philosophy aimed at achieving strong alignment between our long-term strategic goals and our shareholders&#146; interests. We actively engaged with our shareholders by seeking their input about features they valued as we evolved the program design. Our Compensation Committee and Board recognized it would be premature to move to business metric-based pay before Mr.&nbsp;Nadella established, and the Board concurred with, his vision for the Company and the strategy that would embody that vision. As a result, performance-based pay elements were added in fiscal year 2016 once our new strategy was set. In fiscal year 2017, we implemented significant changes that increased the portion of pay that is performance-based and the portion of incentive pay that is quantitatively determined using pre-established metrics. For fiscal years 2018 and 2019, we continued the program with few changes. We believe our focus on strategic goals, strengthening trust, and driving a strong culture have been critical to Microsoft&#146;s success. Our fiscal year 2019 achievements include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Revenue exceeded $125&nbsp;billion. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Commercial cloud revenue grew 43% to $38.1&nbsp;billion. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Server products and cloud services revenue grew 25%. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Azure revenue grew 72%. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14%. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Gaming revenue grew 10% to $11.4&nbsp;billion. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Surface revenue grew 23% to $5.7&nbsp;billion. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; LinkedIn revenue grew 28% to $6.8&nbsp;billion. Percentages are year-over-year. Commercial cloud revenue includes Office 365 Commercial, Azure, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;27 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;1 &#150; Compensation Governance and Philosophy Executive Compensation Governance Our Compensation Committee establishes the design of our executive compensation program. After considering Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s recommendations, the Compensation Committee also approves the annual target compensation (base salaries, target cash incentives, and equity incentive compensation) for our Named Executives, except Mr.&nbsp;Nadella. After considering the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the independent members of our Board approve Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s base salary, target cash incentive, regular stock awards, and target performance stock award. &nbsp; Our Board and our Compensation Committee deeply value the continued interest of and feedback from our shareholders on our executive compensation program and are committed to maintaining an active dialogue with them to ensure their perspectives are thoughtfully taken into account. We carefully consider both the level of voting support from our shareholders on our say-on-pay vote, as well as comments from shareholders, when evaluating our executive compensation program. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, 96% of the votes cast supported our advisory resolution on the compensation of our Named Executives (&#147;say-on-pay&#148; vote). In fiscal year 2019, our Board Chair and members of management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning over 49% of Microsoft shares, providing regular reports of those discussions to our directors. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholder&nbsp;Engagement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 96% 2018 say-on-pay vote &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Engaged with shareholders owning over 49% of shares &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Compensation Committee also retains, and seeks the advice of, Semler Brossy, an executive compensation consulting firm that is independent of management. See Part&nbsp;1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors &#150; Board Committees for more information on Semler Brossy&#146;s role and independence as an advisor to the Committee. Executive Compensation Philosophy We design our executive officer compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain the key executives who drive our success and industry leadership while considering individual and Company performance and alignment with the long-term interests of our shareholders. We achieve our objectives through a compensation program that: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Provides a competitive total pay opportunity. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Emphasizes pay for performance by delivering a majority of our executives&#146; pay through performance-based incentives. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Provides strong alignment with our shareholders, with at least 70% of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives delivered in the form of equity awards. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Focuses on the long term through equity awards with multi-year vesting or performance requirements. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk-taking, assisted by our stock ownership requirements and executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy. Competitive Pay We compete for senior executive talent with global information technology companies, large market capitalization U.S. companies, and smaller, high-growth technology businesses, depending on the role. The technology labor market is hyper-competitive with demand growing faster than the supply of technical talent, resulting in significant increases in compensation at the companies with whom we compete for this talent. The same conditions exist in the market for executive-level talent that can provide innovative leadership while managing at a global scale across several complex businesses. We expect these trends to continue and will adjust our approach to executive compensation to respond to evolving market conditions. To ensure that our Board and Compensation Committee have current information to set appropriate compensation levels, we conduct an executive compensation market analysis each year that draws from third-party compensation surveys and publicly available data for a group of peer companies. We supplement this analysis with additional market information specific to each executive officer&#146;s role and responsibilities, including information gleaned from our experience recruiting for executive positions at Microsoft. While this market analysis and supplemental data inform the decisions of the independent Board members and our Compensation Committee on the range of compensation opportunities, we do not tie executive officer compensation to specific &nbsp; &nbsp; 28 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; market percentiles. Because other companies actively recruit our executive officers to fill CEO and other senior leadership positions, we supplement market information with data on external opportunities potentially available to our executive officers. We also consider the relationship of annual target compensation among internal peers. In addition, our Committee is provided with an overview of compensation for our non-executive Microsoft employees and how this compensation relates to Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s compensation. In setting our fiscal year 2019 executive compensation design and compensation levels, we considered pay practices at the largest technology and general industry companies that were selected after review of three primary screening criteria: market capitalization, revenue, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;). As of June&nbsp;30, 2019, our market capitalization was at the top of our peer group, our revenue was at the 66 th percentile of our peer group, and our EBITDA was at the 91 st percentile of our peer group. Our Compensation Committee selected this peer group because it believed these companies are led by executives with similarly complex roles and responsibilities. The Committee also screened these companies to ensure they had a significant presence outside the United States and excluded companies in the financial services sector because of the different regulatory environment in which they operate. For fiscal year 2019, this compensation peer group comprised these companies: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer&nbsp;Group&nbsp;Used&nbsp;for&nbsp;Fiscal&nbsp;Year&nbsp;2019&nbsp;Pay&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Technology &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;General&nbsp;Industry &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alphabet &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cisco Systems &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facebook &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;IBM &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oracle &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualcomm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT&amp;T &nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boeing &nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chevron &nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coca-Cola &nbsp;&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comcast &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExxonMobil &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Johnson &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merck &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;PepsiCo &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pfizer &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procter&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Gamble &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verizon &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wal-Mart &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walt Disney &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Performance-Based Pay Our incentive compensation arrangements are tied to specific performance measures that drive long-term performance and value creation. For fiscal year 2019: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 55% of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives was performance-based, on average. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 50% of the annual cash incentive for our Named Executives was tied to achieving pre-established financial targets. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 50% of the annual target equity opportunity for our Named Executives was delivered in the form&nbsp;of a performance-based stock award with payouts based on achievement against pre-established strategic objectives. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Metrics under our performance stock awards were reviewed to ensure they reflect key business developments that drive long-term growth. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Our performance stock awards included a relative total shareholder return (&#147;TSR&#148;) multiplier&nbsp;to reward significant positive outperformance, thereby strengthening the alignment of the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;29 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least 70% of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives is equity-based to incentivize a long-term focus and align their interests with those of our shareholders.

Discouragement of Unnecessary and Excessive Risk-Taking We strive to meet our objectives while maintaining executive compensation leading practices that discourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best&nbsp;Practices&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;A stock ownership policy that reinforces the alignment of executive officer and shareholder interests (including stock ownership of 15x base salary for the CEO). &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;A strong executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy to ensure accountability. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;A policy prohibiting pledging, hedging, and trading in derivatives of Microsoft securities. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No stock option awards. &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No excessive perquisites (no executive-only club memberships, medical benefits) and no tax gross-ups. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No employment agreements. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No change in control benefits. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No executive-only retirement programs. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No guaranteed bonuses. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No dividends paid on unvested stock awards. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;2 &#150; Compensation Program Design Consistent with our philosophy, the compensation program for our Named Executives in fiscal year 2019 consisted of an annual base salary plus annual cash and equity incentives awarded under our Executive Incentive Plan (&#147;Incentive Plan&#148;). Annual cash incentives were performance-based, with 50% determined formulaically based on achievement against pre-established financial targets and 50% determined qualitatively based on performance in three weighted performance categories. Equity incentives under the Incentive Plan were allocated 50% to target performance stock awards (&#147;PSAs&#148;) and 50% to stock awards with four-year vesting (&#147;SAs&#148;). The Compensation Committee and the independent Board members believed the 50/50 balance between PSAs and SAs appropriately supported our long-term business goals and long-term retention incentives for our Named Executives. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal&nbsp;Year&nbsp;2019&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;Structure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft&#146;s pay mix targets a high proportion of equity and performance-based compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Base Salaries Our Named Executives&#146; base salaries align with the scope and complexity of their roles, their capabilities, and with prevailing market conditions. Annual Cash Incentives Cash incentives are determined in two performance categories, as follows. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &#147;Incentive Plan Revenue&#148; and &#147;Incentive Plan Operating Income&#148; are non-GAAP financial measures defined at page 34. For fiscal year 2019, the financial formulaic portion of the annual cash incentives were determined based on meeting pre-established performance targets for Incentive Plan Revenue and Incentive Plan Operating Income. The fiscal year 2019 Incentive Plan Revenue and Incentive Plan Operating Income performance targets were based on meeting the Company&#146;s internal 2019 operating budget and were higher than our fiscal year 2018 actual performance for both metrics, further reflecting appropriately ambitious performance goals. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;31 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The qualitative portion of each Named Executive&#146;s fiscal year 2019 annual cash incentives was determined based on assessment of individual performance against financial, operational, and strategic indicators in three performance categories.

No Other Fiscal Year 2019 Compensation During fiscal year 2019, no other compensation was awarded to our Named Executives. &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;3 &#150; Fiscal Year 2019 Compensation Decisions Our Named Executives were awarded the following compensation in fiscal year 2019: Fiscal Year 2019 Base Salaries As part of the annual review of target compensation opportunities, our Compensation Committee and, for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board, approved increases to several of our Named Executives&#146; base salaries in September 2018. The independent members of our Board approved a base salary of $2.5&nbsp;million for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella (a $1&nbsp;million increase). In approving Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s salary, the independent members of our Board considered his significant contributions to Microsoft&#146;s success during his tenure as CEO, including the results described at page 27 and under the heading &#147;Fiscal Year 2019 Stock Awards&#148; at page 37, as well as the criticality of encouraging Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s continued strong leadership. Our Compensation Committee also approved base salaries of $975,000 for Ms.&nbsp;Hood (a $100,000 increase) and $860,000 for Mr.&nbsp;Smith (a $60,000 increase) based on a competitive market review of their roles and contributions. We believe our Named Executives&#146; salary levels continue to be appropriate and reasonable given their roles, capabilities, and experience. Fiscal Year 2019 Cash Incentive Awards We did not change our target percentages for cash incentive awards, which are measured as a percentage of base salary for fiscal year 2019, which were: Satya Nadella &#150; 300%; Amy Hood &#150; 250%; Jean-Philippe Courtois 225%; Margaret Johnson &#150; 200%; and Bradford Smith &#150; 250%. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;33 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Compensation Committee and, for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board, determined the fiscal year 2019 cash incentive awards. These were based on two performance categories: quantitative financial results and qualitative performance results. Final results under each portion of the cash incentive, and the resulting awards, were as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Nadella &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hood &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courtois &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith &nbsp; &nbsp; Quantitative financial results (50%) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 171.81% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 171.81% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 171.81% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 171.81% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 171.81% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Qualitative performance results (50%) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 136.67% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 150.00% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 150.00% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 120.00% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145.00% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total FY19 cash incentive (% of target) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 154.24% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160.91% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160.91% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 145.91% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 158.41% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total FY19 cash incentive ($) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $10,796,868 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $3,855,040 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $2,889,049 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $2,086,456 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $3,366,148 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quantitative Financial Results We achieved greater than target performance on the fiscal year 2019 financial performance measures shown below, resulting in a weighted payout of 171.81%. &nbsp; Formulaic Financial Results (50% weight) ($ in billions) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Threshold &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Target &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Maximum &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Actual &nbsp; &nbsp; FY19 Incentive Plan Revenue &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $125.06 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $131.50 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $137.30 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $135.25 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FY19 Incentive Plan Operating Income &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $37.43 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $40.46 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $45.31 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $44.29 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#147;Incentive Plan Revenue&#148; and &#147;Incentive Plan Operating Income&#148; are non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate Incentive Plan Revenue by adjusting GAAP Revenue for (1)&nbsp;the net impact of revenue deferrals, (2)&nbsp;credits and incentives, and (3)&nbsp;the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate Incentive Plan Operating Income by adjusting GAAP Operating Income for the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on a &#147;constant dollar&#148; basis by converting current period non-GAAP (i.e., adjusted for the items in the preceding two sentences) results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars into United States dollars using constant exchange rates, which are determined at the outset of the current period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. These Incentive Plan financial metrics differ from the non-GAAP financial results we report in our quarterly earnings release materials. They should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. &nbsp; Qualitative Performance Results &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp; The key results influencing the Compensation Committee and independent Board members&#146; decisions on the qualitative performance portion of Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s cash incentive are set forth below. Results are out of a possible 200% in each category. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 34 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighted&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Categories&nbsp;-&nbsp;Satya&nbsp;Nadella&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 Product &amp; Strategy (33.3% weight) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 130% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under Mr. Nadella&#146;s leadership and ongoing commitment to long-term success, the Company saw a strong finish to a record fiscal year delivering more than $125 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit revenue and net income growth in 2019. &nbsp; The commercial cloud business led the way, surpassing $38 billion in revenue, growing over 40% for the year. The strength in commercial cloud growth was across Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. The commitment to customer success resulted in deeper partnerships and larger, longer-term cloud agreements. Microsoft continued to make investments across the key strategic areas to build new platforms and enhance and differentiate Microsoft&#146;s technology stack, including application infrastructure, data and artificial intelligence (&#147;AI&#148;) business process, productivity, collaboration, and hardware. Microsoft Teams had a very successful year, with more than 13 million daily active users and 19 million weekly active users. &nbsp; Further, the closing of the GitHub acquisition in October 2018 and its successful integration has created new opportunities to build the developer community. With GitHub, Microsoft now has the opportunity to bring all its resources to better serve this very important community of developers around the world. Microsoft also invested in building a developer toolchain independent of language, framework, or cloud. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are now the most popular code-editing tools in the world, and TypeScript is the fastest-growing programming language. &nbsp; Windows 10 momentum was very strong this past year as well, reaching 800 million active devices. While opportunities remain for the Company with consumers, the Company&#146;s Gaming business made new investments to empower the world&#146;s gaming community. However, the Company needs to make progress to strengthen our consumer business and additional work is needed in consumer-facing strategies. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 Customers &amp; Stakeholders (33.3% weight) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 145% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Nadella continued to lead strong efforts to build trust with stakeholders, and his personal engagement with customers, partners, and investors has been exceptional. The fiscal year 2018 reorganization of customer facing organizations into Customer Solutions Areas, which aligned go-to-market activities more closely with customers&#146; desired business outcomes, directly shaped our fiscal year 2019 results. Mr. Nadella&#146;s ongoing efforts to build trust in technology have also helped with government relationships around the world. In addition, an increased focus on customers by industry helped Microsoft prioritize and secure partnerships with beachhead/influential customers and was successful. &nbsp; Under Mr. Nadella&#146;s leadership and direction, the Company expanded upon its core mission that participation in every community and country leads to local economic and social benefits. Also under Mr. Nadella&#146;s leadership, the Company has continued its purpose-driven mission of enabling people and organizations around the world to achieve more, and helped build trust on complex topics of data privacy, cybersecurity, digital safety, accessibility and artificial intelligence. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 Culture&nbsp;&amp; Organizational Leadership (33.3% weight) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 135% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Nadella continued to demonstrate his commitment to evolve Microsoft culture, where his successes include achieving aspirational goals for diversity goals in hiring and retention. In fiscal year 2019, nearly 80% of employees and managers surveyed indicated they understand how to leverage a new core priority for inclusion to contribute towards building a more diverse and inclusive workplace. Moreover, 90% of employees said their managers created an inclusive environment. Work remains to be done to provide additional training and resources for the Company&#146;s mid-level managers and address the needs of the millennial workforce. &nbsp; Surveys of employee sentiment and Senior Leadership Team feedback show strong support for Mr. Nadella&#146;s cultural push for One Microsoft and Growth Mindset initiatives. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;35 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Other Named Executives The key results influencing the Compensation Committee&#146;s decisions on the qualitative performance category portion of the cash incentive for the other Named Executives are summarized below. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Key&nbsp;Results &nbsp; Amy E.

Fiscal Year 2019 Stock Awards In September 2018, the independent members of our Board reviewed Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s annual equity compensation given his significant contributions to Microsoft&#146;s success, and the fact that the long-term performance stock award granted to Mr.&nbsp;Nadella at his appointment to CEO would begin to vest in February 2019 and be fully vested in two and one-half years. In reviewing Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s annual equity compensation, the independent members of our Board recognized the benefit of Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s proficiency as CEO, as demonstrated by Microsoft&#146;s achievements during his tenure including: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Market capitalization that grew from $302&nbsp;billion (upon Mr. Nadella&#146;s February 2014 promotion to CEO) to over $850&nbsp;billion on September&nbsp;4, 2018; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s strategic leadership, including his efforts to strengthen trust with customers, drive for a company-wide culture change, and successful entry and expansion into new technologies and markets; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Strong execution of Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s vision for the Intelligent Cloud; and &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Microsoft&#146;s significantly larger scale relative to most market peers on measures of revenue, operating income, and market capitalization. The independent members of the Board also concluded that it would be desirable to have the same pay structure for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella and other Named Executives; and to ensure that Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s incentives are aligned to shareholder returns by emphasizing equity compensation. In light of these considerations, the independent members of the Board increased Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s annual target equity compensation by $10,000,000, split evenly between PSAs and SAs. The fiscal year 2019 PSAs and SAs granted to our Named Executives under the Incentive Plan are listed below. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; PSAs (Target&nbsp;Number of&nbsp;Shares)&sup1; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; SAs (Number of&nbsp;Shares)&sup2; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Aggregate Target Award&nbsp;Value&sup3; ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 111,280 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 111,280 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 25,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amy E.

Vesting is subject to continued employment except as described at page 40 below. &nbsp; (3) Awarded value (in dollars) was converted to shares using the closing share price on August&nbsp;31, 2018, rounded up to a whole number. The amounts listed in the table above for fiscal year 2019 PSAs will not match the amounts in the Stock Award column in the Summary Compensation Table or the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table. Because the grant date of a PSA occurs when the performance targets are set, and targets under our PSA awards are established annually, SAs listed in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards table include portions of current and prior year PSA awards, as described in more detail in Note (2)&nbsp;to the Summary Compensation Table on page 43. Vesting of Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s Long-Term Performance Stock Award Upon Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s appointment to CEO, he was granted a one-time long-term performance-based stock award (&#147;LTPSA&#148;). LTPSA payouts are tied to Microsoft&#146;s total shareholder return relative to the S&amp;P 500 (&#147;relative TSR&#148;) over three overlapping five-year performance periods. The first of these periods commenced with Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s appointment as CEO and ended February&nbsp;3, 2019. Under the LTPSA, target awards are paid if Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR is at the 60% level, and at the maximum 150% of target level if Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR is at or above the 80% level. For each of the three five-year performance periods, the number of shares earned at threshold is 150,000, at target 600,000, and at maximum 900,000. During the first five-year performance period, Microsoft&#146;s market capitalization increased $509&nbsp;billion (from $302&nbsp;billion to $811 billion), and Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR was in the 97th percentile, resulting in Mr.&nbsp;Nadella earning and vesting in the maximum 900,000 shares. Fiscal Year 2017 PSAs (Completed Performance Period) Our Compensation Committee (and for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board) granted PSAs in fiscal year 2017 (&#147;fiscal year 2017 PSAs&#148;) that pay out based on specific pre-established, performance goals and strategic performance objectives tied to creating long-term shareholder value. Performance was measured over the three-fiscal year performance period ending June&nbsp;30, 2019. The maximum award for the fiscal year 2017 PSAs was 300% of target, reduced from the 400% of target maximum applicable to the fiscal year 2016 PSAs. The actual performance under the fiscal year 2017 PSAs reflected the strong business achievement on core metrics and Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR during this period.

We exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on a &#147;constant dollar&#148; basis by converting current period non-GAAP results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars into United States dollars using constant exchange rates, which are determined at the outset of the fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. These metric results differ from certain non-GAAP financial results we report in our quarterly earnings release materials; they should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Relative TSR Multiplier The core metric results for the fiscal year 2017 PSAs were then subject to adjustment based on the relative TSR performance multiplier, which compares our TSR for the three-fiscal year performance period to the TSR of the S&amp;P 500. Our TSR for the performance period was positive and ranked in the 97th percentile of the S&amp;P 500. Based on this positioning, the total payment percentage for the fiscal 2017 PSAs was increased by 50%, resulting in the payout to our Named Executives of 196.53% of the target fiscal 2017 PSA shares. Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 PSAs (Open Performance Periods) Performance under the fiscal year 2018 and 2019 PSAs will be assessed following the end of the three-year performance periods ending June&nbsp;30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The number of shares of common stock to be earned will be based on an assessment of (1)&nbsp;performance against the metric goals during the applicable performance period, and,&nbsp;if Microsoft&#146;s absolute TSR is positive during the period,&nbsp;and (2) Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR during the period. The metrics and relative weightings under the fiscal year 2018 and 2019 PSAs are as follows: &nbsp; Metrics &nbsp;&nbsp; Weights (%) &nbsp; Commercial Cloud Revenue &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 34 &nbsp; Commercial Cloud Subscribers &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 33 &nbsp; Windows 10 Monthly Active Devices &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; Consumer Post-sales Monetization Gross Margin &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; LinkedIn Sessions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; Surface Gross Margin &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;4 &#150; Other Compensation Policies and Information No Significant Executive Benefits and Perquisites Our Named Executives are eligible for the same benefits available to our other full-time employees. In the U.S., our benefits include our section&nbsp;401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, health care plan, life insurance plans, and other welfare benefit programs. In addition to the standard benefits offered to all U.S. employees, we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our U.S. executive officers and senior managers. This deferred compensation plan is unfunded, and participation is voluntary. The deferred compensation plan allows our Named Executives to defer their base salary, the cash portion of their Incentive Plan awards, and certain on-hire bonuses. We do not contribute to the deferred compensation plan. Named Executives are eligible for matching gifts for charitable donations above the maximum for our other U.S.-based full-time employees. Mr.&nbsp;Courtois participates in the standard benefits for employees in France, including profit sharing and the car allowance program available to senior managers. During fiscal year 2019, we provided no executive-only perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named Executives other than matching gifts made to charitable organizations. Post-Employment Compensation Our Named Executives do not have employment contracts. No Named Executive is entitled to any payments or benefits following a change in control of Microsoft. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;39 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Named Executives may be eligible for additional vesting of their outstanding SAs following termination of employment on the same terms as our other employees. All U.S. employees who retire from Microsoft after (a)&nbsp;age 65 or (b)&nbsp;age 55 with 15 years of service are eligible for the continuation of vesting of outstanding SAs granted at hire or at the time of annual performance review, if the award was granted over one year before the date of retirement. A pro-rata portion of PSA shares will also continue vesting if the retirement occurs more than one year after the beginning of the performance period. As of June&nbsp;30, 2019, only Mr.&nbsp;Smith was retirement eligible, and the value of his SAs and PSAs eligible for continued vesting if he retired on that date was $24,131,956 (assuming PSAs are earned at 100% of target). All employees whose employment with Microsoft terminates due to death or total and permanent disability generally fully vest in their outstanding SAs. Our PSAs, and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s LTPSA that was granted to him in connection with his appointment as CEO, vest for the target number of shares upon death or total and permanent disability. The value of our Named Executives&#146; SAs, PSAs, and LTPSAs that would have vested assuming a June&nbsp;30, 2019 termination of employment due to death or total and permanent disability was: Mr.&nbsp;Nadella,&nbsp;$239,491,545; Ms.&nbsp;Hood,&nbsp;$43,767,545; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois,&nbsp;$37,557,695; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson,&nbsp;$22,217,534; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith,&nbsp;$37,552,069. In addition, our Named Executives are eligible to participate in the Microsoft Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan (&#147;Severance Plan&#148;). The Severance Plan was adopted to help ensure continuity of key leaders by providing designated executives severance payments and benefits if their employment is terminated without cause. For purposes of the Severance Plan, &#147;cause&#148; means (i)&nbsp;a conviction or plea of guilty or no contest to a felony or certain misdemeanors; (ii)&nbsp;engaging in gross misconduct; (iii)&nbsp;repeated failure to substantially perform the duties of the executive&#146;s role; (iv)&nbsp;violation of any securities laws; or (v)&nbsp;violation of Microsoft&#146;s policies designed to prevent violations of law. The Severance Plan payments and benefits have four components &#150; cash, stock vesting, continued health care, and outplacement assistance &#150; all provided by Microsoft. Cash payments consist of (i)&nbsp;a severance payment equal to 12 months&#146; base salary plus target annual cash incentive award, payable in a lump sum within 60 days after termination of employment; and (ii)&nbsp;a pro-rata payment of the executive officer&#146;s target annual cash incentive award for the partial year of work, payable in a lump sum at the same time other Incentive Plan cash awards for the year are paid. Stock vesting applies to SAs and PSAs. SAs that otherwise would vest in the 12-month period after employment terminates continue to vest. After the first year of the PSA performance period is completed, a pro-rata portion of any PSA shares will also vest, and the number of shares subject to pro-ration is the lesser of the target award shares or the shares that are otherwise earned and payable after the end of the performance period. Continued contributions to premiums for COBRA health care continuation coverage and outplacement assistance will be provided on the same terms as are available to other employees whose employment is terminated without cause. There is no change-in-control provision in the Severance Plan. To receive the Severance Plan payments and benefits, the Named Executive must execute a separation agreement that includes a release of claims in favor of Microsoft, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12-month non-compete/non-solicitation restrictions. Mr.&nbsp;Nadella participates in the Severance Plan on the same terms as our other executive officers, except that under his LTPSA award, if Microsoft terminates his employment without cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) during a performance period, he will vest in a pro-rata fraction of the threshold 150,000 shares of Microsoft common stock subject to the award for his actual period of employment during the performance period. This table shows the amounts that would have been payable to our Named Executives upon a termination of employment without cause on June&nbsp;30, 2019. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Amount Payable ($) &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $96,811,443 1 &nbsp; Amy E.

To reinforce this value through our executive compensation program, our executive officers and certain other senior executives are subject to a strong &#145;no fault&#146; executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy. Under this policy, our Compensation Committee may seek to recover payments of incentive compensation if the performance results leading to a payment are later subject to a downward adjustment or restatement of financial or nonfinancial performance. Our Committee may use its judgment in determining the amount to be recovered where the incentive compensation was awarded subjectively. Our Committee may also seek recovery of up to the entire amount of any incentive compensation awarded during a period where a covered executive committed a significant legal or compliance violation. Our executive compensation recovery policy is available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Robust Stock Ownership Policy Our executive officers and certain other senior executives are required to maintain a minimum equity stake in Microsoft. This policy embodies our Compensation Committee&#146;s belief that our most senior executives should maintain a significant personal financial stake in Microsoft to promote a long-term perspective in managing our business. In addition, the policy helps align executive and shareholder interests, which reduces incentive for excessive short-term risk taking. Each covered executive is required to acquire and maintain ownership of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to a specified multiple of his or her base salary, which ranges from 5 to 15 times base salary, as shown in the table below. Each covered executive must retain 50% of all net shares (post-tax) that vest until achieving his or her minimum share ownership requirement. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Share&nbsp;Ownership Requirement&nbsp;as&nbsp;of June&nbsp;30, 2019 &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15x&nbsp;base&nbsp;salary &nbsp; Amy E.

Smith &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8x&nbsp;base&nbsp;salary &nbsp; In fiscal year 2019, each of our Named Executives complied with our stock ownership policy. Our stock ownership policy is available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Hedging Policy Our Named Executives are subject to our Derivatives Trading, Hedging, and Pledging policy described at page 10. Deductibility of Executive Compensation Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (&#147;Section&nbsp;162(m)&#148;) imposes an annual deduction limit of $1&nbsp;million on the amount of compensation paid to each of the CEO, the CFO, and certain other current or former named executive officers (together, &#147;covered employees&#148;). Prior to the effectiveness of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#147;TCJA&#148;), the deduction limit did not apply to &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; satisfying the requirements of Section&nbsp;162(m). Cash and equity awards granted to our Named Executives under the Incentive Plan reported in the summary compensation table for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 were subject to one or more performance goals intended to satisfy the requirements of the exemption to Section&nbsp;162(m) for performance-based compensation, including a requirement of positive operating income for the fiscal year. The performance goal of positive operating income for the first fiscal year following the award also applied to the LTPSA granted to Mr.&nbsp;Nadella in February 2014. For fiscal year 2017 and 2018, the performance goals were approved by our Compensation Committee, following shareholder approval of the material terms of these performance goals under the Incentive Plan. Payment under the awards is conditioned on Committee certification that the goals and any other material terms have been met. Effective with fiscal year 2019, the TCJA eliminated the Section&nbsp;162(m) provisions exempting performance-based compensation and deferred compensation amounts payable after termination from employment from the $1&nbsp;million deduction limit, subject to an exception for remuneration pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November&nbsp;2, 2017. Based on current law, we believe the remuneration under our Incentive Plan reported in the summary compensation table that qualifies for this &#147;written binding contract&#148; exception is: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The portion of fiscal year 2018 cash incentives payable based on formulaic financial results. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Payments under fiscal year 2017 and 2018 SAs. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;41 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Payments under our fiscal year 2017 and 2018 PSAs to the extent attributable to fiscal year 2017 or 2018 performance against metrics established for those years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SAs and PSAs that vest upon a Named Executive&#146;s termination of employment due to death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of the Section&nbsp;162(m) performance goal would not be deductible as performance-based compensation. In structuring compensation for our executive officers, our Compensation Committee considers whether compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes. However, the changes implemented to Section&nbsp;162(m) under the TJCA are expected to significantly limit deductibility of compensation paid under current and future awards to covered employees. Accordingly, our Committee awards compensation that is nondeductible. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;Risk&nbsp;Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We performed an annual assessment for the Compensation and Audit Committees of our Board of Directors to determine whether the risks arising from our fiscal year 2019 compensation policies and practices were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Microsoft. Our assessment reviewed the material elements of executive and non-executive employee compensation. We concluded these policies and practices do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Microsoft. &nbsp; The structure of our compensation program for our executive officers does not incentivize unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. The base salary component of compensation does not encourage risk-taking because it is a fixed amount. The Incentive Plan awards have these risk-limiting characteristics: &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash incentive awards under the Incentive Plan are limited to 200% of a&nbsp;target cash incentive award. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash incentive awards are structured 50% based on pre-established goals (balance of growth and profitability goals) and 50% based on individual performance as assessed across three performance categories, diversifying the risk associated with any single aspect of performance. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Incentive Plan award value is delivered in shares of Microsoft common stock with multi-year vesting schedules or performance periods, which aligns the interests of our executive officers to long-term shareholder interests. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA metrics further diversify the elements of the program to minimize the incentive to produce any particular outcome. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSAs use Company-wide measures that are not specific to any one executive officer&#146;s sphere of responsibility and that apply equally to all participants to encourage a unified and responsible approach to achieving financial and strategic goals. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overlapping performance periods for PSAs limit the impact of short-term business performance or share price fluctuations on final outcomes. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity awards are not made in the form of stock options, which may provide an asymmetrical incentive to take unnecessary or excessive risks to increase the market price of Microsoft common stock. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of our Compensation Committee (or for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board of Directors) approve all Incentive Plan awards to executive officers, including performance achievement levels that determine final payout outcomes. &nbsp; In addition, awards are subject to our Executive Compensation Recovery Policy, described in this Section&nbsp;4 &#150; Other Compensation Policies and Information &#150; Strong Clawback Policy. Executive officers are subject to our executive stock ownership requirements, described in this Section&nbsp;4 &#150; Other Compensation Policies and Information &#150; Robust Stock Ownership Policy. &nbsp; &nbsp; 42 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis provided above.

The value of SAs is reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends because dividends are not paid on SA shares until vesting. The value of PSAs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation performed as of the date of grant by an independent third party. Because the grant date for a PSA occurs when performance targets are approved, and we approved performance targets in each of fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, PSA values in this column include: (i)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2019, 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2019 PSAs, the fiscal year 2018 PSAs, and the fiscal year 2017 PSAs; (ii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2018, 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2018 PSAs and fiscal year 2017 PSAs, and 16.66% of the fiscal year 2016 PSAs; and (iii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2017, 33% of the fiscal year 2017 PSAs and 16.66% of the fiscal year 2016 PSAs. The grant date fair values of included PSAs, assuming at the grant date that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved for each PSA are: (i)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2019, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, $35,050,220; Ms.&nbsp;Hood, $19,823,991; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois, $15,380,642; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, $10,253,798; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $17,211,903; (ii) for fiscal year 2018, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, $21,723,387; Ms.&nbsp;Hood $12,921,957; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois, $7,114,107; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, $7,551,291; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $11,429,189; and (iii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2017, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, $10,639,556; Ms.&nbsp;Hood, $6,274,167; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois, $3,287,828; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, $3,782,271; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $5,556,198. &nbsp; (2) Includes Incentive Plan cash incentives. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;43 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) None of our Named Executives received reimbursements for relocation expenses or tax-gross-up payments in the last three fiscal years.

SAs and PSAs were granted under the 2017 Stock Plan, except that the 2017 and 2018 PSAs were granted under the 2001 Stock Plan. &nbsp; (2) This column represents fiscal year 2019 cash incentives as reported in the &#147;Non-equity Incentive Plan Compensation&#148; column of the Summary Compensation Table. &nbsp; (3) These columns represent the threshold, target, and maximum shares for the PSAs with a grant date in fiscal year 2019. Because the grant date for a PSA occurs when PSA performance targets are approved, the reported number of shares is calculated as the target shares for the portion of the PSAs for which performance targets were set in fiscal year 2019 (33.33% of each of the 2019, 2018, and 2017 PSAs). The threshold is calculated as if the threshold of only the least weighted metric (50% of 5.00% for each of the 2019, 2018, and 2017 PSAs) is met. The maximum is calculated assuming all maximum targets were met and the relative TSR multiplier was fully earned. &nbsp; (4) Includes the grant date fair values for SAs and PSAs calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on the market price of the shares subject to the award on the date of grant. The value of SAs is reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends because dividends are not paid on SA shares until vesting. Values for PSAs in this column are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation performed as of the date of grant by an independent third party. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;45 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding Equity Awards at June&nbsp;30, 2019 Table This table provides information about unvested SAs and PSAs held by the Named Executives on June&nbsp;30, 2019. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Awards &nbsp; Name &nbsp; Award Date &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Number&nbsp;of Shares&nbsp;or&nbsp;Units of Stock that Have Not Vested 1 (#) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Market&nbsp;Value of Shares or Units&nbsp;of&nbsp;Stock that Have Not&nbsp;Vested 2 ($) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Equity&nbsp;Incentive&nbsp;Plan Awards: Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested 1 (#) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Equity&nbsp;Incentive Plan Awards: Market&nbsp;or&nbsp;Payout Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Unearned Shares, Units, or Other Rights That Have Not Vested 2 ($) &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp; &nbsp; 2/4/2014 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 300,000 3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 40,188,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/15/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 22,749 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,047,456 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/20/2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 48,948 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,557,074 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/20/2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 130,526 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 17,485,263 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/19/2017 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 62,693 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,398,354 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/19/2017 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 66,872 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,958,173 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/18/2018 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 111,280 4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 14,907,069 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/18/2018 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 37,093 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,968,978 &nbsp; Amy E.

Microsoft&#146;s Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded and unsecured. It allows participants to defer a specified percentage of their base salary (up to 75%) and/or eligible cash incentives (up to 100%). Participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to U.S. senior managers, including our U.S. Named Executives. Microsoft does not contribute to the Deferred Compensation Plan or guarantee any returns on participant contributions. When an employee elects to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan, the employee must specify the percentage of base salary and/or cash incentive award to be deferred and the timing of distributions. No withdrawals are permitted prior to the previously elected distribution date, other than withdrawals for certain severe financial hardships as permitted by applicable law. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with hypothetical investment earnings based on participant investment elections made from among deemed investment options available under the plan. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;47 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CEO Pay Ratio For fiscal year 2019, the annual total compensation for the median employee of the Company (other than our CEO) was $172,512 and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $42,910,215. Based on this information, for fiscal year 2019 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 249 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We identified our median employee from among our employees as of June&nbsp;30, 2019, the last day of our fiscal year, excluding approximately 1,980 employees who became Microsoft employees in fiscal year 2019 in the following business acquisitions: Bonsai AI, Inc., Cordata, Inc., DataSense business from BrightBytes Inc., Citus Data Inc., Compulsion Games Inc. Dependabot Ltd, Drawbridge Inc., Express Logic Corporation, FSLogix, Inc., GitHawk, GitHub Inc., Glint, Inc., Good Software LLC, inXile Entertainment Inc., Lobe Artificial Intelligence, Inc., Ninja Theory Limited, Obsidian Entertainment, Inc., Spectrum business from Space Program, Inc., and Undead Labs LLC. To identify our median employee, we used a &#147;total direct compensation&#148; measure consisting of: (i)&nbsp;fiscal year 2019 annual base pay (salary or gross wages for hourly employees, excluding paid leave), which we annualized for any permanent employees who commenced work during the year, (ii)&nbsp;bonuses and cash incentives payable for fiscal year 2019 (excluding allowances, relocation payments, and profit-sharing), and (iii)&nbsp;the dollar value of SAs granted in fiscal year 2019. Compensation amounts were determined from our human resources and payroll systems of record. Payments not made in U.S. dollars were converted to U.S. dollars using 12-month average exchange rates for the year. To identify our median employee, we then calculated the total direct compensation for our global employee population and excluded employees at the median who had anomalous compensation characteristics. Our Compensation Committee was provided with information on the fiscal year 2018 CEO pay ratio before recommending Mr. Nadella&#146;s fiscal year 2019 target annual compensation. &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity Compensation Plan Information This table provides information about shares of Microsoft common stock that may be issued under our equity compensation plans approved by shareholders and plans not approved by shareholders (if any) as of June&nbsp;30, 2019. Under the 2017 and 2001 Stock Plans, no option or stock appreciation rights may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, repurchased for cash or other consideration, or modified without shareholder approval (except in connection with a change in our capitalization) if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the share underlying the award. &nbsp; Plan Category &nbsp;&nbsp; Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Securities to&nbsp;be Issued upon Exercise&nbsp;of&nbsp;Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights 1 (a) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighted-Average Exercise price of Outstanding Options,&nbsp;Warrants and Rights 2 ($)(b) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation&nbsp;Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected&nbsp;in&nbsp;Column&nbsp;(a)) 3 (c) &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity compensation plans approved by security&nbsp;holders &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 151,278,668 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $13.86 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 433,201,805 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 151,278,668 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $13.86 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 433,201,805 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Represents shares issuable upon vesting of outstanding SAs granted under the 2017 and 2001 Stock Plans and PSAs for which there is a grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718; includes shares under PSAs and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s LTPSA that will vest if target performance levels are achieved. &nbsp; (2) The weighted average exercise price does not take into account the shares issuable upon vesting of outstanding stock awards, which have no exercise price. &nbsp; (3) Includes 105,467,405 shares remaining available for issuance as of June&nbsp;30, 2019 under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. &nbsp; &nbsp; 48 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation Mses.&nbsp;Warrior and Peterson and Messrs.

Audit Committee Matters &nbsp; &nbsp; Audit Committee Report Charter and Responsibilities The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. It is available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . The charter, which was last amended effective July&nbsp;1, 2019, includes a calendar that outlines the Committee&#146;s duties and responsibilities. The Committee reviews the charter and calendar annually and works with the Board of Directors to amend them as appropriate to reflect the evolving role of the Committee. The Board has the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including oversight of the management of Microsoft. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of Microsoft, the audits of Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the qualifications and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged as Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, and the performance of Microsoft&#146;s internal auditor. The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. Management is also responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of Microsoft&#146;s system of internal control. Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP (&#147;Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#148;), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The independent auditor is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Microsoft&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Fiscal Year 2019 Activity During fiscal year 2019, the Audit Committee fulfilled its duties and responsibilities as outlined in the charter and the accompanying calendar. The Committee meets twice each quarter; once in connection with quarterly Board of Directors meetings and once to review the quarterly Form 10-Q or annual Form 10-K. In addition, the Committee meets as needed to address emerging accounting, compliance, or other matters or for educational training. Specifically, the Committee: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditor Microsoft&#146;s quarterly earnings press releases, consolidated financial statements, and related periodic reports filed with the SEC. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and discussed with management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and the independent auditor&#146;s opinion about the effectiveness of Microsoft&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and discussed with management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor, as appropriate, the audit scopes and plans of both the internal auditor and the independent auditor. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Inquired about significant business and financial reporting risks, reviewed Microsoft&#146;s policies for risk assessment and risk management, and assessed the steps management is taking to control these risks. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Met in periodic executive sessions with each of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor to discuss the results of the examinations by the independent and internal auditors, their evaluations of internal controls, and the&nbsp;overall quality of the Company&#146;s financial reporting, and any other matters as appropriate. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Met with the CEO and CFO to discuss the processes they have undertaken to evaluate the accuracy and fair presentation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed with management and the independent auditor the Company&#146;s critical accounting policies, significant changes in the selection or application of accounting principles, the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, and critical audit matters addressed during the audit. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;51 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed the Company&#146;s related party transactions and Policy for Related Party Transactions. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Received reports about the receipt, retention, and treatment of financial reporting and other compliance concerns. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and assessed the qualitative aspects of the Company&#146;s ethics and compliance programs. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed with the Chief Compliance Officer, legal and regulatory matters that may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting. Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Statements The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditor Microsoft&#146;s audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2019, and the independent auditor&#146;s&nbsp;report on those financial statements. Management represented to the Committee that Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche presented the matters required to be discussed with the Committee by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) standards and Rule 2-07 of SEC Regulation&nbsp;S-X. This review included a discussion with management and the independent auditor of the quality (not&nbsp;merely the&nbsp;acceptability) of Microsoft&#146;s accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. Based on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Microsoft&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2019, for filing with the SEC. Independent Auditor Tenure and Rotation As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche has been Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor since the Company&#146;s initial public offering in 1986. Deloitte rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years; the Audit Committee interviews proposed candidates and selects the lead audit engagement partner. Pursuant to this process, the Committee selected a new Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche lead audit engagement partner beginning with the fiscal year 2020 audit. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having an independent auditor with an extensive history with the Company. These include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Higher quality audit work and accounting advice due to Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s institutional knowledge of our business and operations, accounting policies and financial systems, and internal control framework. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Operational efficiencies and a resulting lower fee structure because of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s history and familiarity with our business. Independence and Performance of Outside Audit Firm The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, both in fact and appearance, and takes a number of measures to ensure independence. The Committee leads the selection of the lead audit engagement partner, working with Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche with input from management. The Committee has established a policy pursuant to which all services, audit and non-audit, provided by the independent auditor must be pre-approved by the Committee or its delegate. This policy prohibits the independent auditor from providing non-audit services such as bookkeeping or financial systems design and implementation. The Company&#146;s pre-approval policy is more fully described below in this Part 3 &#150; Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor. Given the amount and the nature of the non-audit services provided, the Committee has concluded that provision of those services was compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche. In addition, Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche has provided the Committee with the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant&#146;s communications with the audit committee concerning independence. The Committee has reviewed these materials and discussed the firm&#146;s independence with Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche. As provided in its charter, in addition to evaluating Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s independence, the Audit Committee performed its annual assessment of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s performance as independent auditor during fiscal year 2019. This evaluation was consistent with the approach described in &#147;External Auditor Assessment Tool&#148; published by the Center for Audit Quality.

The Committee reviewed a variety of indicators of audit quality including: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The quality and candor of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s communications with the Audit Committee and management. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; How effectively Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche maintained its independence and employed its independent judgment, objectivity, and professional skepticism. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The level of engagement and value provided by the Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche national office. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The depth and expertise of the global Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche audit team. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The quality of insight demonstrated in Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s review of the Company&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and remediation of control deficiencies. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Available external data about quality and performance, including reports of the PCAOB on Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche and its peer firms and Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s response to those reports. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The appropriateness of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s fees, taking into account the size and complexity of the Company and the resources necessary to perform the audit. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s knowledge of our global operations, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s tenure as the Company&#146;s independent auditor and safeguards in place to maintain its independence. Recommendation of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche as Independent Audit Firm for Fiscal Year 2020 As a result of its evaluation, the Audit Committee concluded that the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche as the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2020 is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

These services support the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over revenue recognition and enhance the independent auditor&#146;s understanding of our licensing programs and controls. Tax Fees Tax fees generally consist of tax compliance and return preparation, and tax planning and advice. Tax compliance and return preparation services consist of preparing original and amended tax returns and claims for refunds. Tax planning and advice services consist of support during income tax audits or inquiries. All Other Fees All other fees consist of permitted services other than those that meet the criteria above and include training activities, and subscriptions and surveys on economic, industry, accounting, and human resources topics. The Audit Committee concluded that the provision of the non-audit services listed above is compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche. &nbsp; &nbsp; Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor The Audit Committee has a policy for pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. Each year, the Committee approves the terms on which the independent auditor is engaged for the ensuing fiscal year. At least quarterly, the Committee reviews and, if appropriate, pre-approves services to be performed by the independent auditor, reviews a report summarizing fiscal year-to-date services provided by the independent auditor, and reviews an updated projection of the fiscal year&#146;s estimated fees. The Committee, as permitted by its pre-approval policy, from time to time delegates the approval of certain permitted services or classes of services to a member of the Committee. The Committee then reviews the delegate&#146;s approval decisions each quarter. Microsoft uses a centralized internal system to collect requests from Company personnel for services by the independent auditor to facilitate compliance with this pre-approval policy. &nbsp; &nbsp; 54 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.

We hold our say-on-pay vote every year. &nbsp; Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. Statement in Support Pay for Performance Through our ongoing shareholder engagement, we receive consistent feedback that our investors favor incentive compensation arrangements tied to specific performance measures that drive long-term performance and value creation. We have responded to investor feedback, and our program design has evolved so that it incorporates performance elements directly linked to achievement of our long-term strategic goals. Key features of our fiscal year 2019 executive compensation program were: &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;55%of the annual target compensation opportunity for our named executive officers was performance-based, on average. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%of the annual cash incentive was tied to achieving pre-established financial targets. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%of the annual target equity opportunity for our named executive officers was delivered in the form&nbsp;of performance-based stock awards with payouts based on achievement against pre-established strategic objectives. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metricsunder our performance stock awards are strategic measures that drive long-term growth. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ourperformance stock awards included a relative total shareholder return multiplier,&nbsp;to reward significant positive outperformance, thereby strengthening the alignment of the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our long-term shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay&nbsp;for&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50% annual cash incentive determined formulaically, based on achievement against pre-established financial targets. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50% target equity awards were performance stock awards with strategic metrics. &nbsp; Sound Program Design We design our executive compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain the key executives who drive our success. Pay that reflects performance and alignment of that pay with the interests of long-term shareholders are key principles that underlie our compensation program. We achieve these objectives through compensation that: &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides a competitive total target pay opportunity. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consists primarily of equity compensation, which encourages our executives to act as owners with a significant stake in Microsoft. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivers a majority of pay based on performance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balances long-term and short-term incentives. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhances long-term focus by subjecting a significant percentage of total target compensation to multi-year performance requirements or vesting. &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 56 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Best Practices in Executive Compensation The compensation program for our executive officers demonstrates we follow best practices. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We Do &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Have a stock ownership policy that reinforces alignment between the interests of our shareholders and our executive&nbsp;officers. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Have a strong executive compensation (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy to ensure accountability. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Prohibit pledging, hedging, and trading in derivatives of Microsoft securities. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Have an independent compensation consultant advising the&nbsp;Compensation Committee. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We Do Not &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Offer excessive perquisites (no executive-only club memberships or medical benefits) or tax gross-ups. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Have employment contracts. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Provide change in control benefits. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Have executive-only retirement programs. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Guarantee bonuses. &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Pay dividends on unvested stock awards. &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Board and Compensation Committee reviewed the prior year&#146;s voting results and, through our regular shareholder engagement, sought to understand the factors that influenced voting decisions. The Board and the Compensation Committee will continue to consider feedback obtained through this process in making future decisions about our executive compensation program. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&nbsp;Proposal&nbsp;3:&nbsp;Ratification&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;of&nbsp;Deloitte&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Touche&nbsp; LLP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;Independent&nbsp;Auditor&nbsp;for Fiscal&nbsp;Year 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP as Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor for fiscal year 2020. The Board asks shareholders to ratify that selection. Although current law, rules, and regulations, and the charter of the Audit Committee, require the Audit Committee to engage, retain, and supervise Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, the Board considers the selection of the independent auditor to be an important matter of shareholder concern and is submitting the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche for ratification by shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice. As described in Part 3&nbsp;&#150; Audit Committee Matters, the Board considers the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche as Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor for fiscal year 2020 to be in the best interests of Microsoft and its shareholders. &nbsp; Receipt of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve this proposal. If the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider the result a recommendation to consider selection of a different firm. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the independent auditor. Shareholder Proposal 1: Report on Employee Representation on Board of Directors A shareholder has advised us that it intends to submit the following proposal for consideration at our Annual Meeting. Employee Representation on the Board of Directors WHEREAS: Our company&#146;s employees, including management and top performing engineers, are crucial to our ability to offer shareholders continued return on their investment. A 2018 Forbes article emphasized the need for retaining top employees by &#147;focus[ing] on excellence in engagement&#146;&#146;; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;57 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, in the past two years relations with our Company&#146;s employees have been strained: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Microsoft employees protested the company&#146;s alleged failure to curtail gender discrimination and sexual harassment. They reported sexual harassment and threats, as well as a pattern of women being unfairly passed over for promotions; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; During the recent controversial separation of immigrant children from their families, over 300 employees wrote an open letter denouncing Microsoft&#146;s connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; A group of employees argued that Microsoft &#147;crossed the line into weapons development&#146;&#146; when they publicly dissented against Microsoft&#146;s military contract to develop augmented reality headsets for soldiers; Shareholders fear that these examples illustrate deficient responsiveness to employee concerns and low satisfaction at the company. A news story on the employee letter related to the ICE contract, quoted an employee stating that &#147;in a week they managed to wipe away all the goodwill...&#148;; In 2018, the Accountable Capitalism Act was introduced into the U.S. Congress to combat &#147;America&#146;s fundamental economic problems&#148; such as companies&#146; failure to reinvest proceeds in their operations, including employees; The Act would require that &#147;boards ... include substantial employee participation ... ensur[lng] that no fewer than 40% of [a board&#146;s] directors are selected by the corporation&#146;s employees&#148;; Several European countries require employee representation on boards. Academic analysis of one such policy indicated a positive effect, stating that it &#147;offer[s] advantages for technical efficiency, skill development and knowledge generation through its protection of specific human capital investments&#148;; A recent poll found that a majority of Americans &#147;would support allowing employees at large companies to elect representatives to those companies&#146; boards of directors...&#146;&#146;; Shareholders believe that our company can advance long-term value creation through a diverse board that includes non-management employee representation. RESOLVED: Shareholders of Microsoft urge the Board of Directors to prepare a report to shareholders describing opportunities for the company to encourage the inclusion of non-management employee representation on the Board. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: The report should be prepared within one year, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary and privileged information. The Board is encouraged to assess: &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp; Any legal, technical, practical, or organizational impediments to non-management employees gaining board nomination; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. &nbsp; Benefits and challenges associated with board membership by non-management employees; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. &nbsp; Opportunities or procedures through which non-management employees could gain nomination to the board, such as allocation of board slots for non-management employees, special board nomination processes for non-management employees, potential for building upon the company&#146;s existing proxy access provision, and any needed changes to corporate governance documents to accomplish such changes. Board Recommendation on Shareholder Proposal 1 The Board recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION Our existing director selection process is designed to identify and nominate the strongest director candidates from all available sources, including our employees. We believe an employee candidate for the Board of Directors should be evaluated by the same standards and criteria as any other candidate. This proposal would require us to deviate from our existing rigorous processes and could diminish the effectiveness of our Board. An effective board of directors consists of individuals with a diverse and complementary blend of experiences, skills, and perspectives. As described in Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors &#150; Director Selection and Qualifications, our Governance and Nominating Committee, along with the full Board, evaluates and recommends director nominees. In doing so, they carefully assess the specific qualifications of potential director nominees and determine whether they will contribute to an effective, diverse Board that operates openly and collaboratively to serve the best interests of all of our shareholders. As stated in Director &nbsp; &nbsp; 58 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection and Qualifications, the Board considers many factors, including general understanding of global business, sales and marketing, finance, and other disciplines relevant to the success of a large, publicly traded company; understanding of our business and technology; educational and professional background; personal accomplishment; and national, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. Our Board draws its strength and effectiveness from the broad perspective built into our nomination process. Our directors collectively have senior leadership experience at major domestic and international companies. They have key management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, leadership development, and international business. Many of our directors also have experience on boards of other global public companies, giving them a broad understanding of corporate governance practices and trends, challenges, and strategies. Any shareholder can recommend a prospective director candidate, including a Company employee, for the Board&#146;s consideration. We describe how to do this above in Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors &#150; Director Selection and Qualifications &#150; Shareholder Recommendations and Nominations of Director Candidates. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider and evaluate nominees proposed by shareholders in the same manner as a nominee recommended by a Board member, management, search firm, or any other source. Giving non-management employees a dedicated position on the Board, a different process for board representation, or a different set of qualifications would undercut the role of the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board in one of the most important and strategic elements of corporate governance. Having an independent board is a core element of our governance philosophy. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our directors will be independent. Except for our CEO Satya Nadella and our co-founder Bill Gates, all of our current directors are independent. This proposal suggests we should add another director employed by Microsoft. This would decrease the number of directors who qualify as independent of the Company. We take an active interest in the health of Microsoft&#146;s culture, human resource management, and the employee experience. We have built accountability for these things into our executive compensation. As detailed in Part&nbsp;2 of this Proxy Statement, our Named Executive Officers&#146; annual cash incentives includes consideration of their performance on a variety of qualitative factors, including diversity and inclusion and workplace culture. Employees have numerous ways to be heard and exert influence outside of board representation. Establishing the best work environment we can for our employees is a key element of our continued success. Open and respectful communication is one of Microsoft&#146;s core values, and we have multiple channels for all stakeholders, including employees, to provide feedback to management. For example, our CEO and senior leaders regularly host company- and organization-wide meetings to provide business updates and answer questions posed by employees. Employees can raise questions at any time on the CEO Connection page on Yammer. We poll our entire employee population annually to collect feedback on management, strategy, culture, compensation, and a variety of other areas, and the Company&#146;s Chief Human Resource Officer presents a summary of that information to the Board annually. We encourage employees to raise issues or questions through our Open Door Policy, which states that employees can raise any concerns or questions to any member of management or to Human Resources. As we describe in our company-wide Standards of Business Conduct training, employees have multiple avenues to raise and have addressed, anonymously if they wish, any compliance or other concern. The askboard@microsoft.com email alias is a vehicle for submitting questions directly for the Board&#146;s attention. The Company takes information communicated through these venues very seriously, including feedback about culture, diversity, business practices, and compliance and regularly provides responses and updates on issues that employees raise. The Board, the Compensation Committee, and the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee engage with the Company&#146;s SLT and Human Resources executives across a broad range of human capital management topics including culture, succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, employee recruiting and retention, and diversity and inclusion. For these reasons, the Board believes that changing our board nomination and membership framework with respect to Company employees as outlined by this proposal is unnecessary and will not enhance shareholder value. Receipt of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve this proposal. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;59 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shareholder Proposal 2. Report on Gender Pay Gap Two shareholders have advised us that they intend to submit the following proposal for consideration at our Annual Meeting. Gender Pay Equity Whereas : The World Economic Forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy 1.2 trillion dollars annually. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80&nbsp;percent of that of their male counterparts. This disparity can equal nearly half a million dollars over a career. The gap for African American and Latina women is 60&nbsp;percent and 55&nbsp;percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059. United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs, but mostly ignore median pay gaps. Regulation in the United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. And while Microsoft reported an eight percent median hourly pay gap and 13&nbsp;percent bonus pay gap for its United Kingdom operations, it has not published median information for its global operations. Microsoft reports women earn 99.7&nbsp;percent of the compensation received by men on a statistically adjusted equal pay basis. Yet, that statistically adjusted number alone fails to consider how discrimination affects differences in opportunity. In contrast, median pay gap disclosures address the structural bias that affects the jobs women hold, particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs. Women account for nearly 28&nbsp;percent of Microsoft&#146;s employees, but only 22&nbsp;percent of leadership. Mercer finds actively managing pay equity &#147;is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.&#148; Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey , and Robeco Sam suggests gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, &#147;the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling.&#148; Best practices include &#147;tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.&#148; Public policy risk is of concern, not only in the United Kingdom, but in the United States as well. The Paycheck Fairness Act pends before Senate. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened equal pay legislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee reports 40&nbsp;percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination. Resolved : Shareholders request Microsoft report on the company&#146;s global median gender pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining female talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). Supporting Statement : A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation. Board Recommendation on Shareholder Proposal 2 The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION We share the proponents&#146; commitment to gender pay equity at Microsoft. However, we believe the disclosures and processes the proponents are suggesting focus on data that is not a good measure of our direction or success. Moreover, our current disclosures, programs, and initiatives provide significant transparency and create specific internal accountabilities to address gender pay gap concerns. At Microsoft, we know that if we want to build products and services for everyone on the planet, our employees need to be representative of everyone on the planet. To that end, we&#146;re committed to equal pay for equal work, and to ensuring the representation of women throughout the Company at all levels. To demonstrate our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce, we provide transparency on many aspects of our workforce. Since 2016, we have reported annually on pay equity of both female and minority employees compared with male and &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Caucasian employees, respectively, with the same job title and level. We make this information public in our diversity, representation, and pay equity report at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/default.aspx , so that we can demonstrate not only equal pay for equal work, but our progress in achieving fair representation of women and minorities across numerous Company segments, including the entire workforce, technology positions, non-technology positions, and leadership. In November 2018, we reported that for every $1.000 earned by males, female employees in the U.S. earn $1.000 in the same job title and level. Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. combined earn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their Caucasian counterparts. In our 2019 reporting, we will add equal pay information for the five countries outside the U.S. in which we employ the most people. These six countries will cover nearly 80 percent of our total employee population and we plan to increase that percentage annually. We recognize that beyond equal pay, the hiring and advancement of women and minorities into management and leadership positions is another crucial factor that will close any overall difference in pay between men and women and racial and ethnic minorities. We set aspirational representation goals for ourselves and measure our progress against those goals. Notably, our executives are reviewed on their success driving culture and organizational leadership, which can include performance indicators that focus on diversity and inclusion on their teams. To improve diversity in hiring, we have created or participate in numerous programs designed to augment the pipeline of female and other diverse talent pools. For example, we invest in programs to educate, attract, and inspire girls and young women into an education in STEM subjects. Our DigiGirlz program at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/programs/digigirlz/default.aspx gives high school girls the chance to participate in hands-on computer and technology workshops, learn about careers in technology, and connect with Microsoft employees. We also help girls grow their skills and love for technology through our support of Technolochicas at https://technolochicas.org /, Black Girls Code at http://www.blackgirlscode.com /, and Girls Who Code at https://girlswhocode.com /. Additionally, through our YouthSpark program, we spend time with thousands of girls across the world, providing workshops in coding and encouraging young people to consider careers in technology including interview technique, resume writing, and more. Our Women@Microsoft Employee Resource Group enables girls to participate in STEM role modelling workshops as part of our schools outreach program. Beyond pipelining programs, we also consider ways we can influence the broader Microsoft ecosystem to be more diverse. Examples include our minority supplier programs as well as efforts to ensure our vendors offer programs offer minimum parental leave to support a more diverse workforce. Beginning with our 2019 reporting in November, we will provide even more transparency in representation through additional segmentation of the data to include more reporting into the number of women and racial and ethnic minorities in manager versus individual contributor roles, middle management roles, and leadership roles. In contrast, the single median pay gap metric being proposed doesn&#146;t help us improve our approach or provide the details our managers and leaders need to make hiring, promotion, and retention decisions in a way that drives representation of women in management and leadership roles. We believe that the metrics we use drive both equal pay for equal work and meaningful recruitment and advancement of diverse employees across all levels of our global workforce, including in executive and senior roles. Our Board is highly engaged in our diversity and inclusion efforts. Management reports pay equity, diversity, and representation information to the Compensation Committee on a regular basis. In addition, the Board is committed to its own diversity, by actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which new candidates are selected. We work with our search firm to ensure that candidate slates provided to the Committee include diverse candidates. The slate of directors nominated in this Proxy Statement represents a Board comprising five women (38%), seven members with gender or ethnic diversity (54%), and if the slated is elected, two of our four Board committees will be chaired by women. In addition to focusing on increasing diversity within the pipeline of tech talent, we look outside our traditional recruiting practices to become more expansive in our sources and more inclusive in our processes. We are focused on inclusive job descriptions, diverse slates, inclusive interview practices and, most importantly, taking the time to ensure we find and &#147;screen in&#148; the best talent. At its core, screening in reflects our desire to bring in talented people who aren&#146;t carbon copies of existing employees, because building a homogenous workforce isn&#146;t the best way to innovate and problem solve for the increasingly diverse customers we serve. Screening in involves finding common ground with candidates, instead of ways of ruling them out. We continue to invest significantly in our intern and explorers programs which are highly diverse and yield high conversion to full time hires. Equally important to recruiting more diverse talent is our ability to retain them. We know that people go where they are invited, but they stay where they are welcomed. Our programs are designed to enhance promotion and retention of women in leadership roles. Our managers play an important role in the development of talent. We in turn are investing in managers&#146; development, so they can be better coaches and advocates across the employee&#146;s experience at work. Our senior leadership team is held accountable to achieve progress in this area, as a portion of their bonus is tied to progress on diversity and inclusion within their respective &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;61 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; organizations. As detailed in Part&nbsp;2, our Named Executive Officers&#146; annual cash incentives includes consideration of their performance on a variety of qualitative factors including diversity and inclusion and workplace culture. Our employees play a critical role in helping us create a culture where women and diverse groups can thrive. Our open partnerships with Employee Information and Policy groups (One Voice), Diversity and Inclusion Councils, Employee Resource Groups, and Employee Networks are critical to helping us create a safe, inclusive environment. We continue to invest in our Employee Resource Groups (LGBTQI+, disAbility, families, Asians, Blacks, Hispanic/Latinx, Women and military) and employee networks to build community and create opportunity. We partner closely with them to identify, discuss, and address the unique needs surfaced by each community. We train all employees on unconscious biases that, among other things, can impede the career progress of underrepresented groups. More recently, we made inclusion a &#147;core priority&#148; for all employees at Microsoft, which means that as part of the performance review and growth process, every employee is asked to make inclusion a regular &#150; and personal &#150; part of their job. In summation, we do not believe that the additional data requested in the proposal would improve upon our existing commitment to pay equity and the advancement of women at Microsoft. We believe that our existing reporting of equal pay and other metrics related to women in our workforce demonstrate our efforts to recruit, retain, and promote women, and fulfills the objective of this proposal, making the report requested in the proposal unnecessary. Receipt of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve this proposal. &nbsp; &nbsp; 62 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.

It is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation to be voted during the Annual Meeting for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. Shareholders who execute proxies retain the right to revoke them at any time before the shares are voted by proxy during the meeting.

Proxies may be solicited by officers, directors, and employees of Microsoft, none of whom will receive any additional compensation for their services. D.F. King&nbsp;&amp; Co., Inc. may solicit proxies at a cost we anticipate will not exceed $20,000. These solicitations may be made personally or by mail, facsimile, telephone, messenger, email, or the Internet. Microsoft will pay persons holding shares of common stock in their names or in the names of nominees, but not owning such shares beneficially, such as brokerage houses, banks, and other fiduciaries, for the expense of forwarding solicitation materials to their principals. Microsoft will pay all proxy solicitation costs. Shareholders of record at the close of business on October&nbsp;8, 2019, will be entitled to vote during the meeting on the basis of one vote for each share held. On October&nbsp;8, 2019, there were 7,695,351,675 shares of common stock outstanding, held of record by 92,626 shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; Householding To reduce costs and reduce the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting, a single Proxy Statement and Annual Report, along with individual proxy cards or individual Notices of Internet Availability, will be delivered in one envelope to certain shareholders having the same last name and address and to individuals with more than one account registered at our transfer agent with the same address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected shareholder. Shareholders participating in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. If you are a registered shareholder and would like to enroll in this service or receive individual copies of this year&#146;s and/or future proxy materials, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare, by mail at P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY, 40233-5000; by phone at (800)&nbsp;285-7772, option 1; or by email at web.queries@computershare.com . If you are a beneficial shareholder, you may contact the broker or bank where you hold the account. &nbsp; &nbsp; Election of Directors Thirteen directors are to be elected during the Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, the directors are not elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by our Bylaws. The accompanying proxy will be voted in favor of the nominees presented in Part 1 &#150; Governance and Our Board of Directors to serve as directors unless the shareholder indicates to the contrary on the proxy. All the nominees except Ms.&nbsp;Walmsley are current directors. The Board expects that each of the nominees will be available for election, but if any of them is unable to serve at the time the election occurs, the proxy will be voted for the election of another nominee designated by our Board. &nbsp; &nbsp; Voting Procedures Tabulation of Votes Our independent election inspector, Broadridge Financial Services, will tabulate votes cast by proxy or electronically during the meeting. We expect to publish the final vote tabulation on our website at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/corporate-governance/votingresults.aspx within one business day after the Annual Meeting. We will also report the results in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. Majority Vote Standard for Election of Directors In an uncontested election, each director will be elected by a majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means the number of shares cast &#147;for&#148; a director&#146;s election exceeds the number of votes cast &#147;against&#148; that director. We will not treat as cast any share (a)&nbsp;whose ballot is marked as withheld, (b)&nbsp;that is otherwise present during the meeting but for which there is an abstention, or (c)&nbsp;that is otherwise present during the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In a contested election, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, meaning the directors receiving the largest number of &#147;for&#148; votes will be elected. &nbsp; &nbsp; 64 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A contested election is one in which: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; As of the last day for giving notice of a shareholder nominee, a shareholder has nominated a candidate for director according to the requirements of our Bylaws. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; As of the date that notice of the meeting is given, the Board of Directors considers that a shareholder candidacy has created a bona fide election contest. In an uncontested election, a nominee who does not receive a majority vote will not be elected. Except as explained in the next paragraph, an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote will continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of: (a)&nbsp;90 days after the date on which the election inspector determines the voting results as to that director, (b)&nbsp;the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by that director, or (c)&nbsp;the date of that director&#146;s resignation. The Board of Directors may fill any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director as provided in our Bylaws. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee who fails to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to our Board about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the Governance and Nominating Committee&#146;s recommendation and within 90 days after certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. Additional details about this process are specified in our Bylaws, which are available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Vote Required; Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes The shares of a shareholder whose ballot on any or all proposals is marked as &#147;abstain&#148; will be included in the number of shares present during the Annual Meeting to determine whether a quorum is present. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held by a broker or other custodian, you may instruct your broker how to vote your shares through the voting instruction form included with this Proxy Statement. If you wish to vote the shares you own beneficially during the meeting, you must first request and obtain a &#147;legal proxy&#148; from your broker or other custodian. If you choose not to provide instructions or a legal proxy, your shares are referred to as &#147;uninstructed shares.&#148; Whether your broker or custodian has the discretion to vote these shares on your behalf depends on the ballot item. The following table summarizes the votes required for passage of each proposal and the effect of abstentions and uninstructed shares held by brokers. Brokers and custodians cannot vote uninstructed shares on your behalf in director elections, &#147;say-on-pay&#148;, and shareholder proposals. For your vote to be counted, you must submit your voting instruction form to your broker or custodian. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Votes Required for Approval &nbsp;&nbsp; Abstentions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstructed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shares Management Proposals Election of 13 Directors &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive&nbsp;Office&nbsp;Compensation (&#147;say-on-pay&#148;) &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; Ratification of the Selection of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLC as our Independent Auditor for Fiscal Year 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discretionary&nbsp;vote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Shareholder Proposals Report on Employee Representation on Board of Directors &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; Report on Gender Pay Gap &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted Vote Confidentiality We maintain the confidentiality of the votes of individual shareholders. Ballots, proxy forms, and voting instructions returned to&nbsp;brokerage firms, banks, and other holders of record are kept confidential. Only the proxy solicitor, proxy tabulator, and inspector of election have access to the ballots, proxy forms, and voting instructions. The proxy solicitor and the proxy tabulator will disclose information taken from the ballots, proxy forms, and voting instructions only if there is a proxy contest, if the shareholder authorizes disclosure, to defend legal claims, or as otherwise required by law. If you write comments on your proxy card or ballot, management may learn how you voted in reviewing your comments. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;65 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where to Find More Proxy Voting Information &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The SEC website has a variety of information about the proxy voting process at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters.shtml . &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Contact the Microsoft Investor Relations department through our website at http://www.microsoft.com/investor or by phone at 425-706-4400. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; You may view our Annual Report and vote your shares at http://www.proxyvote.com . &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Contact the broker or bank through which you beneficially own your shares.

We will provide any of the foregoing information to a shareholder without charge upon written request to MSC 123/9999, Office of the Corporate Secretary, Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399 . &nbsp; &nbsp; Proposals by Shareholders for 2020 Annual Meeting Shareholders who, in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8, wish to present proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed for next year&#146;s annual meeting must submit their proposals so they are received by the Corporate Secretary of Microsoft, by one of the means described below, no later than the close of business (5:30 p.m. Pacific Time) on June&nbsp;18, 2020. As the rules of the SEC make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee that it will be included. In order to be properly brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting, a shareholder&#146;s notice of nomination of one or more director candidates to be included in the Company&#146;s proxy statement and ballot pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.14 of our Bylaws (a &#147;proxy access nomination&#148;) must be received by the Corporate Secretary of Microsoft, by one of the means described below, no earlier than May&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2020 and no later than the close of business on June&nbsp;18, 2020 (i.e., not later than the close of business on the 120th day nor earlier than the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date the definitive proxy statement was first released to shareholders in connection with the preceding year&#146;s annual meeting of shareholders). If the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is first made by the Company. In order to be properly brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting, a shareholder&#146;s notice of any matter the shareholder wishes to present (other than a matter brought pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 or a proxy access director nomination), or the person or persons the shareholder wishes to nominate as a director, must be received by the Corporate Secretary of Microsoft, by one of the means described below, no earlier than August&nbsp;6, 2020, and no later than the close of business on September&nbsp;5, 2020 (i.e., not less than 90 nor more than 120 days before the first anniversary of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting). If our annual meeting date occurs more than 30 days before or 60 days after December&nbsp;4, 2020, we must receive proposals not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of the meeting, the 10th day following the day on which we first make a public announcement of the date of the meeting. To be in proper form, a shareholder&#146;s notice must include the information about the proposal or nominee specified in our Bylaws. A shareholder who wishes to submit a proposal or nomination is encouraged to seek independent counsel about our Bylaw and SEC requirements. Microsoft will not consider any proposal or nomination that is not timely or otherwise does not meet the Bylaw and SEC requirements for submitting a proposal or nomination. Notices of intent to present proposals or nominate directors at the 2020 Annual Meeting, and all supporting materials required by our Bylaws, must be submitted by one of the following means: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Electronically: askboard@microsoft.com . &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; By Mail: MSC 123/9999, Office of the Corporate Secretary, Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399. &nbsp; &nbsp; 66 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements. &nbsp; &nbsp; Other Business The Board of Directors does not intend to bring any other business before the Annual Meeting, and so far as is known to our Board, no matters are to be brought before the meeting other than as specified in the notice of meeting. In addition to the scheduled items of business, the meeting may consider shareholder proposals and matters relating to the conduct of the meeting. As to any other business that may properly come before the meeting, proxies will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the persons voting such proxies. Representatives of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche, independent auditor for Microsoft for fiscal year 2019 and the current fiscal year, will be present during the Annual Meeting, have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and be available to respond to appropriate questions. DATED: Redmond, Washington, October&nbsp;16, 2019. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;67 Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &#150; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table reconciles financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures have been provided to aid investors in better understanding the Company&#146;s performance. The GAAP financial results included the net tax impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#147;TCJA&#148;) and the net tax impact of the transfer of intangible properties. Non-GAAP Definition Transfer of Intangible Properties . In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6&nbsp;billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. The TCJA Impact . During the twelve months ended June&nbsp;30, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a net tax charge of $157&nbsp;million and $13.7&nbsp;billion, respectively, related to the enactment of the TCJA. We have provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties and the TCJA to aid investors in better understanding our performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures assist investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business.
