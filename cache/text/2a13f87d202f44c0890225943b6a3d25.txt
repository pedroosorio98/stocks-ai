In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $111.29, $106.81 and $98.11 at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Second-quarter 2024 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Significant items collectively refer to the net gain related to Visa shares of $7.9B, a donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation of $1.0B and net investment securities losses of $546mm. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $5.0B (after tax) to reported net income from $18.1B to $13.1B; a decrease of $1.72 per share to reported EPS from $6.12 to $4.40; and a decrease of 8ppts to reported ROTCE from 28% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results 5. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense of $317mm, ($72mm) and $420mm for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 9 Additional notes 1. Reflects the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") capital transition provisions. As of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, CET1 capital and Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity reflected the remaining CECL benefit of $720mm; as of June 30, 2023, CET1 capital reflected the benefit of $1.4B. Refer to Note 21 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 and Note 27 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable securities, includes end-of-period HQLA, excluding regulatory prescribed haircuts under the LCR rule where applicable, for both the Firm and the excess HQLA-eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR. Also includes other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 44-51 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 and pages 102-109 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional information 3. The First Republic acquisition closed on May 1, 2023, therefore, the current period included approximately one additional month of results associated with First Republic compared with the prior-year period. Additionally, certain noninterest expense and deposits associated with First Republic were allocated among segments commencing in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in increases or decreases to the YoY change in certain lines. The prior-year quarter also included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7B in Corporate as well as the $1.2B credit reserve established for the First Republic portfolio across LOBs 4. On April 8, 2024, Visa Inc. announced the commencement of an exchange offer for Visa Class B-1 common stock. On May 6, 2024, the Firm announced that Visa accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2mm shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C common stock. Visa’s acceptance resulted in a gain for the Firm relating to the Visa Class C common stock, which is held at fair value.

Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business segments to form one segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank ("CIB") 4. Actual numbers for all periods, not over/(under) 5. Client deposits and other third-party liabilities (“client deposits”) pertain to the Payments and Securities Services businesses 6. Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate 7. As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As of June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured using the Firm’s modeled approach. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 78-80 and Note 26 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 for additional information 8.
