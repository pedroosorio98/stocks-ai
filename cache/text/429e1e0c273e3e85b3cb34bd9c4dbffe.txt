The Company has also removed all references to the &#147; next three largest digital banking platforms in the United States, Europe and Latin America .&#148; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company further respectfully advises the Staff that, based on management&#146;s knowledge of the Company&#146;s industry, the Company believes that the largest digital banking platforms around the world are Ant Group, Tencent, PayTM, PayPal, Square, KakaoBank, Revolut, Tinkoff and Chime, based on the number of customers using banking products. The above-referenced statements are supported by the Company&#146;s comparison of the number of customers of each of Ant Group, Tencent, PayTM, PayPal, Square, KakaoBank, Revolut, Tinkoff and Chime against the number of customers on the Company&#146;s platform, in each case according to the public statements of each of these digital banking platforms and data from WallStreet Research, an independent research firm, and has disclosed these sources on page 98 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1. &nbsp; 4.

Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our Nu Journey, page 99 &nbsp; 9. Please expand your discussion to present your Nu Journey/growth by financial season and product so that investors can evaluate the impact on trends between underwriting, product and cost of risk. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company respectfully acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and advises the Staff that the discussion of the five financial seasons of our customers&#146; journey described on pages 2, 4, 114-115, 203 and 225 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 are intended to facilitate investors&#146; understanding of different phases of our customers&#146; financial trajectories, each of which presents different challenges and opportunities, and that collectively have led to what the Company&#146;s product offering is today. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use the concept of the five financial seasons to enable readers to understand the purpose behind each of our products, which are designed to meet the needs of our customers across different stages of their financial lives, and each financial season, or a combination of seasons, drives our product solutions. However, any given customer does not necessarily progress in a specific sequential order of financial seasons in its adoption of our products. For example, our discussion of the number of products per monthly active customer by quarterly cohort on page 136 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 shows that our earliest cohorts started with a single product and adopted multiple new products as they were introduced (without reference to a particular financial season) and our latest cohorts are starting out with close to three products in the first few months alone, and adoption of each of our products impacts our business differently. Therefore, we use the concept of five financial seasons to organize our description of our product offering in different conceptual stages, but do not use this concept as a managerial, accounting or performance metric to analyze or evaluate our business&#146; operating or financial performance, and accordingly this concept does not enable us to evaluate any impact on trends between underwriting, product and cost of risk. &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; Our Self-Reinforcing Model, page 100 &nbsp; 10. You disclose the four dimensions of your self-reinforcing model; low cost to acquire, low cost to serve, low cost of risk and low cost of funding that fundamentally differentiate you from traditional incumbent institutions. Please expand your Low Cost of Risk discussion to address the following: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Disclose customers risk ratings/behavior scores for the periods presented that contributed to the 45% decline in credit card 90-day delinquency rates from roughly 4.9% at 4Q19 to 2.7% at 1Q21. To the extent such changes were driven by change in product mix and or credit limits, please also provide supporting metrics; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Please disclose how credit limits are utilized in managing credit risk; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Disclose the impact of the reduction in credit limits during the Covid-19 pandemic on the decline on delinquency rate from roughly 4.9% pre-pandemic to 2.7% post pandemic as disclosed on page 107. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company respectfully acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and has revised the disclosure on page 119 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1. The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has not meaningfully changed its product mix or reduced credit limits for any of its existing customers. The Company further advises the Staff that it optimizes credit limits at a consumer level using its credit underwriting engine that balances the expected marginal revenue and expected marginal loss associated with incremental credit limits using an NPV (&#147;Net Present Value&#148;) framework. Credit limit assignment considers the losses coming from potential future draws on an undrawn portion of a credit line under a worsening economic scenario. In addition, the Company pursues a &#147;low and grow&#148; strategy with credit limits, in that it grants lower limits to new customers who the Company assesses as higher risk and then increases those limits selectively based on positive usage and repayment track record. As the Company has clarified on pages 127 and 128 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1, during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company lowered the initial credit limits for new customers, but respectfully advises the Staff that such reductions in initial credit limits for new customers did not significantly contribute to the decline in 90-day delinquency rates. Such declines in delinquency levels were not specific to the Company, but rather were observed across the full credit card industry in Brazil, primarily driven by COVID-19-related government assistance to consumers and increased consumer saving rates. Results of Operations, page 119 &nbsp; 11. Please disaggregate the following consistent with the presentation in Notes 6 and 8 to your consolidated financial statements for the year ended December &nbsp;31, 2020 and provide explanations for period over period changes, including reference to related metrics: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Fee and commission income; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Interest and other financial expenses &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Transactional expenses; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Operating expenses &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company respectfully acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and has revised the disclosure on pages 146-159 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to provide tabular and narrative disclosure of the above-referenced sub-line items where such sub-line items were a principal driver of period-over-period change. &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, page 131 &nbsp; 12.

Please revise your business section disclosure to provide a more complete description, including quantification on a percentage basis if possible, of the relative contributions to your business and revenues from each of the three countries of operations, and each of the five &#147;financial seasons&#148; products. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and respectfully advises the Staff that the Company does not track revenue across the &#147;financial seasons&#148; or attribute a particular revenue stream to any one &#147;financial season.&#148; While the Company believes the &#147;financial seasons&#148; provide a beneficial framework to educate its customers and potential customers on the products and services that the Company offers, the Company does not use the &#147;financial seasons&#148; framework in its evaluation of its financial results or in its financial reporting, and does not segment its revenue across the &#147;financial seasons.&#148; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the portion of the Staff&#146;s comment relating to revenue from the countries in which the Company operates, the Company has revised the disclosure on page 259 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to provide a breakdown of revenue by country. &nbsp; 15.

General &nbsp; 29. We note that throughout the prospectus you often describe the industry and your performance using compound annual growth rate (&#147;CAGR&#148;). Because CAGR only represents two discrete snapshots in time, but does not show trends or events during the period represented, please balance your disclosure by also including the annual rates for the periods represented. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company respectfully acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and has revised the disclosure on pages 3, 204 and 208-209 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 in response. &nbsp; 30. Please provide us with supplemental copies of all written communications, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, that you, or anyone authorized to do so on your behalf, have presented or expect to present to potential investors in reliance on Section &nbsp;5(d) of the Securities Act, whether or not you retained, or intend to retain, copies of those communications. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and respectfully advises the Staff that to date no written communications as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) have been presented to potential investors by the Company or anyone authorized to do so on the Company&#146;s behalf in reliance on Section&nbsp;5(d) of the Securities Act. If in the future any such materials are presented to potential investors by the Company or anyone authorized to do so on the Company&#146;s behalf, the Company will supplementally provide copies to the Staff. &nbsp; 31. Prior to printing and distribution of the preliminary prospectus, please provide us with mock-ups of any pages that include pictures or graphics to be presented. Accompanying captions, if any, should also be provided. We may have comments after reviewing the materials. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company respectfully acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and has included the intended pictures and graphics in Amendment No.&nbsp;1 for the Staff&#146;s review. &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 32. We note that your forum selection provision identifies the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands as the exclusive forum for certain litigation, including any &#147;derivative action.&#148; Please revise your prospectus to state that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In this regard, we note that Section &nbsp;22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Because this exclusive forum provision applies to actions arising under the Securities Act, but does not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act, please also ensure the governing documents state this clearly or tell us how you will inform investors in future filings that the provision does not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response: The Company respectfully acknowledges the Staff&#146;s comment and has revised the disclosure on pages 90 and 298 of Amendment No.&nbsp;1 to clarify that investors cannot waive the Company&#146;s compliance with U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company respectfully advises the Staff that the form of its Memorandum and Articles of Association that will be in effect upon the closing of the proposed initial public offering, which form will be filed as an exhibit to a subsequent amendment to the Registration Statement, provides: &#147;Unless the Company (through approval of the Board of Directors) consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.&#148; The Company intends to retain disclosure in its future filings with the Commission that nothing in the Company&#146;s Memorandum and Articles of Association will preclude shareholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in any court, subject to applicable law. * * * Please do not hesitate to contact me at 212-450-4658 or byron.rooney@davispolk.com or Manuel Garciadiaz at 212-450-6095 or manuel.garciadiaz@davispolk.com if you have any questions regarding the foregoing or if I can provide any additional information.
