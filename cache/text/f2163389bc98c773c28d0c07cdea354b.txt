We are so excited about all the ways we are sharing our products, pushing the limits of what&#8217;s possible, and making technology that empowers people and enriches their lives. &#160; This is an ideal moment to reflect on where we are today, and in that spirit, I&#8217;d invite you to join us for the 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February 24, 2026, where we&#8217;ll celebrate all we&#8217;ve accomplished over the past year. &#160; Our latest iPhone lineup features the most powerful iPhone we&#8217;ve ever made with iPhone 17 Pro, and the thinnest iPhone we&#8217;ve ever made with iPhone Air. Along with iPhone 17, our entire lineup features incredibly advanced camera systems, powerful performance, and all-day battery life our users love. &#160; Our technology has never done more to help our users stay productive, connected, and healthy. With the M5-powered iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, and across our product lineups, Apple silicon continues to deliver unmatched power and performance to help our users get more done. This year, we also introduced a beautiful new design called Liquid Glass, which creates a unified experience across our platforms for the very first time. And I hear from Apple users every day who credit our health and safety features with improving their lives, or even saving them. &#160; AirPods Pro 3 have been another huge hit, delivering remarkable sound quality and the world&#8217;s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And with Live Translation powered by Apple Intelligence, AirPods unlock a whole new way to connect and communicate with people across languages and around the world. &#160; It&#8217;s a powerful example of the incredible possibilities we&#8217;re unlocking with AI, which we see as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. That&#8217;s why, from the silicon to the software, we&#8217;re building our products from the ground up to enable powerful AI experiences. With Apple Intelligence, we&#8217;re delivering on a hallmark of Apple products by making complex technologies easy and accessible for our customers. And we now have dozens of Apple Intelligence features &#8212; like Writing Tools and Visual Intelligence &#8212; that are empowering our users in remarkable ways. &#160; We&#8217;ve also continued to deliver world-class Services &#8212; including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and the App Store &#8212; that give our users even more ways to learn, create, and connect. For instance, Apple TV originals continue to earn praise from fans and critics alike &#8212; including clever comedies like &#8220;The Studio,&#8221; riveting dramas like &#8220;Severance&#8221; and &#8220;Pluribus,&#8221; and thrilling, cinematic hits like &#8220;F1.&#8221; &#160; As always, we&#8217;ve continued to build our values into everything we do &#8212; from our commitment to protecting people&#8217;s privacy and security, to designing our products to be accessible to all. Around the world, we&#8217;re giving students and teachers the tools to learn new skills and harness their creativity. &#160; And we&#8217;re continuously inspired by the imaginative ways people are using our technology to build new businesses, create beautiful art, and serve their communities. &#160; On behalf of everyone at Apple, thank you for your engagement, your confidence, and your belief in our mission. We&#8217;ve accomplished so much together &#8212; and I&#8217;ve never been more optimistic about the future. &#160; Tim Cook Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Proxy Statement Summary &#160; 2025 Business Highlights 8 Executive Compensation 9 Shareholder Engagement 9 Nominees to Apple&#8217;s Board of Directors 10 Progress Across our Values 11 Items of Business and Board Voting Recommendations 12 &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 7 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; 2025 Business Highlights &#160; At Apple, we work to push the limits of what&#8217;s possible, and make technology that empowers people and enriches their lives. 2025 was an exceptional year, with record results, including an all-time revenue record of $416.2 billion for the fiscal year.

That&#8217;s led to many profound innovations helping our users navigate, communicate, and engage with the world around them. And we&#8217;ve continued to drive innovations that help our users live healthier lives, including new features like sleep score and hypertension notifications. &#160; We also believe privacy is a fundamental human right, and we continue to design our products to protect it from the start. That includes Private Cloud Compute for Apple Intelligence, which extends our on-device security model into the cloud. And it includes tools and resources that empower parents and help kids stay safe online without compromising their privacy. &#160; Our values also shape our impact on the communities we&#8217;re a part of. We work to expand access to education and opportunity with programs like the Apple Developer Academies, which help learners build new skills and prepare for promising careers. We continue to innovate to reduce the environmental impact of our devices &#8212; including a new 3D-printing process for the titanium cases of Apple Watch that uses 100 percent recycled materials. And we work to foster a culture of collaboration and belonging, where teams come together to innovate and do the best work of their lives. &#160; From the technology we make, to the communities we serve, teams at Apple are dedicated to leaving the world better than we found it and making a positive difference in people&#8217;s lives. &#160; &#160; 40 years of accessibility innovation at Apple &#160; For 40 years, accessibility has been built into the foundation of everything we make. That commitment began in 1985, when Apple established its first office dedicated to accessibility &#8212; and it continues today across every product we make. &#160; This year, we introduced new features that build on that legacy in meaningful ways.

The Board considers oversight of executive succession planning to be one of its most critical duties, and it is on the agenda for every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. &#160; With respect to Board succession planning, the Board regularly evaluates its composition in the context of Apple&#8217;s long-term strategic goals and monitors the Board&#8217;s mix of skills, backgrounds, and experiences to help ensure that the Board is well-equipped to perform its oversight function effectively. &#160; The Nominating Committee is responsible for coordinating and overseeing the annual Board evaluation process, which includes reviewing the skills and qualifications of individual directors, as well as reviewing the Board&#8217;s structure as a whole to determine if the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. People and Teams &#160; The Board oversees matters related to our people and teams, including with respect to inclusion and diversity, culture and employee engagement, talent recruitment, development, and retention, and has allocated direct responsibilities for this area of oversight to the People and Compensation Committee. &#160; Additionally, Apple&#8217;s People and Compensation Committee oversees risks related to Apple&#8217;s compensation programs. Each year, the People and Compensation Committee evaluates whether the design and operation of Apple&#8217;s compensation programs or policies encourage our executive officers or our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks. In establishing and reviewing Apple&#8217;s compensation programs for risk, the People and Compensation Committee considers program features that mitigate potential risks for our executive officers, such as fixed base salaries; goals that are tied to specific company financial measures and payout caps for the annual cash incentive program; clawbacks for our cash and equity incentives; the quantity and mix of long-term performance-based and time-based equity incentives; and stock ownership requirements. &#160; The People and Compensation Committee also generally considers the program features that mitigate potential risks for our non-executive officer employees. In its annual review, the People and Compensation Committee concluded that Apple&#8217;s executive compensation programs and policies continue to provide an effective and appropriate mix of incentives to help ensure performance is focused on long-term shareholder value creation, and do not encourage short-term risk taking at the expense of long-term results or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Apple.

A copy of this policy is available at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . The policy provides that the Audit Committee must review transactions subject to the policy and determine whether to approve or ratify those transactions. Certain types of transactions are deemed pre-approved pursuant to standing pre-approval guidelines established by the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to its Chair to pre-approve or ratify transactions under certain circumstances. A summary of new transactions covered by standing pre-approvals or transactions approved or ratified by the Chair of the Audit Committee, if any, is provided to the Audit Committee for its review. &#160; In reviewing transactions subject to the policy, the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable, considers (as it deems appropriate for the circumstances): &#160; &#9679; The nature and extent of the related person&#8217;s interest in the transaction; &#9679; The approximate dollar value involved in the transaction; &#9679; The approximate dollar value of the related person&#8217;s interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of any profit or loss; &#9679; Whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of Apple&#8217;s business; &#9679; The material terms of the transaction, including whether the transaction with the related person is proposed to be, or was entered into, on terms no less favorable to Apple than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; &#160; 20 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; &#9679; The business purpose of, and the potential benefits to Apple of, the transaction; &#9679; Whether the transaction would impair the independence of a non-employee director; &#9679; Required public disclosure, if any; and &#9679; Any other information regarding the transaction or the related person in the context of the proposed transaction that would be material to the Audit Committee&#8217;s decision, in its business judgment, in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction. &#160; Several of Apple&#8217;s Board members and executive officers serve as directors or executive officers of other organizations, including organizations with which Apple has commercial and charitable relationships. Apple does not believe that any director had a direct or indirect material interest in any such relationships during 2025 and through the date of this Proxy Statement. &#160; A family member of our former Chief Operating Officer is employed by Apple and received total compensation in excess of $120,000 for the period from the beginning of fiscal year 2025 through the date of the filing of this Proxy Statement. The family member&#8217;s compensation was established by Apple in accordance with our compensation practices applicable to employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions. &#160; Business Conduct Policy &#160; Apple seeks to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws. Apple&#8217;s code of ethics, entitled &#8220;Business Conduct: The way we do business,&#8221; sets out the principles that guide Apple&#8217;s business practices &#8212; honesty, respect, confidentiality, and compliance. The code applies to all employees, including Apple&#8217;s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. Relevant sections of the code also apply to the Board. Apple expects its suppliers, contractors, consultants, and other business partners to follow the principles set forth in the code when providing goods and services to Apple or acting on its behalf. The code is available at apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Business-Conduct-Policy.pdf . Apple intends to disclose any changes to or waivers from this code by posting to our website if disclosure is required by SEC or Nasdaq rules. &#160; Apple&#8217;s code is managed by the Business Conduct organization, under the oversight of Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer. Employees are required to complete training on the code upon joining Apple and annually thereafter. With input from relevant stakeholders and executive leadership, we regularly review and update Apple&#8217;s code and related policies to ensure they provide clear, actionable guidance to our employees, executive officers, and directors. &#160; Additionally, Apple has an insider trading policy governing the purchase, sale, and other dispositions of Apple&#8217;s securities that applies to all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, and other covered persons. Apple also follows procedures for the repurchase of its securities. We believe our insider trading policy and repurchase procedures are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and listing standards applicable to Apple. A copy of Apple&#8217;s insider trading policy was filed as Exhibit 19.1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2024. &#160; Communications with the Board &#160; Any matter intended for the Board, or for any individual member of the Board, should be directed to Apple&#8217;s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA, with a request to forward the communication to the intended recipient.

All of our directors have senior leadership experience at large domestic or multinational companies. In these positions, they have gained significant and varied management experience, including in the areas of strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development. They also have in-depth experience serving at public companies as executive officers, or on boards of directors and board committees, and a robust understanding of corporate governance practices and trends. In addition, many of our directors have experience as directors or trustees of significant public policy, academic, research, non-profit, and philanthropic institutions, and bring the benefit of these perspectives to the Board. &#160; The Board and the Nominating Committee believe the skills and experiences of our directors provide Apple with business acumen and a broad range of perspectives to effectively address Apple&#8217;s evolving needs, oversee senior management in the competent and ethical operation of Apple, and represent the best interests of Apple&#8217;s shareholders. &#160; Evaluation of Candidates &#160; The Board regularly evaluates its composition in the context of Apple&#8217;s long-term strategic goals. When considering candidates for election, the Board assesses each nominee&#8217;s skills, backgrounds, experiences, and contributions in light of the Board&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s evolving needs. Over the past four years, the Board has added three new members, representing over one-third of its membership, and two other, long-serving members retired. In the context of this year&#8217;s Annual Meeting nominations, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders to ask Art Levinson, the Chair of the Board, and Ron Sugar, the Chair of the Audit Committee, to stand for re-election, and to waive for each of them its guideline under which directors generally may not stand for re-election after attaining age 75. In making this determination, the Board considered several factors, including the significant experience and expertise that each of Dr. Levinson and Dr. Sugar brings to the Board, their deep insight into the Company&#8217;s business and operations, and their individual contributions as highly engaged members of the Board. The Board also considered the benefits of continuity among the Board&#8217;s leadership positions. &#160; Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require an annual review by the Nominating Committee of each director&#8217;s various time commitments, including their primary occupation, service on other public company boards and board committees, leadership positions on other boards, as well as service with private company boards and non-profit organizations. Following its review in November 2025, the Nominating Committee determined that, in its view, no director currently has time commitments that would prevent them from properly discharging their duties as directors. &#160; The Nominating Committee has evaluated and recommended to the full Board each of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement for election to the Board. &#160; 24 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Nominee Selection Process &#160; The Nominating Committee oversees board succession planning and recruitment of potential candidates. The Nominating Committee considers candidates who are recommended by the Committee&#8217;s members, other Board members, shareholders, and management, as well as those identified by third-party search firms retained to assist in identifying and evaluating possible candidates. In evaluating potential nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee considers, among other things: independence, character, ability to exercise sound judgment, demonstrated leadership, ability and willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board, and relevant skills, backgrounds, and experiences in the context of the evolving needs and overall composition of the Board. The Nominating Committee is committed to including individuals with a broad range of skills, backgrounds, and experiences in the pool of candidates from which nominees to the Board are selected.&#160; &#160; The Nominating Committee evaluates candidates recommended by shareholders using the same criteria it applies to evaluate other candidates. Shareholders who wish to recommend a director candidate should submit the candidate&#8217;s name and background information in writing to our Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA. In addition, the proxy access provisions in our bylaws provide that a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares continuously for at least three years, may nominate director nominees constituting up to 20% of Apple&#8217;s Board for inclusion in our proxy statement. Nominating shareholders and nominees must satisfy the requirements set forth in our bylaws, which can be found at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . Any notice of director nomination submitted to Apple other than through proxy access must include the additional information required by Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act. &#160; Nominees for Election &#160; The matrix on the following page highlights the mix of key skills and experiences of the nominees that, among other factors, led the Board and the Nominating Committee to recommend these nominees for election to the Board. The matrix is intended to depict notable areas of focus for each director based on the current composition of the Board, and not having a mark does not mean that a particular director does not possess that qualification or skill. Nominees have developed competencies in these skills through education, direct experience, and oversight responsibilities. The Nominating Committee assesses the directors&#8217; mix of skills on an annual basis.

As an Apple employee, Mr. Cook, our CEO, does not receive compensation for his service on the Board. The People and Compensation Committee annually reviews the total compensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. As part of this process, the People and Compensation Committee evaluates market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC (&#8220;Pay Governance&#8221;), and makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee Director compensation after reviewing the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s recommendation. The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the &#8220;Director Plan&#8221;) has an annual limit of $1.5 million for all compensation paid or granted to a Non-Employee Director for service on the Board. &#160; Cash Retainers &#160; Our Non-Employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $100,000. In 2025, the Chair of the Board, Dr. Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $175,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr. Sugar, received an additional cash retainer of $45,000; the Chair of the People and Compensation Committee, Ms. Jung, received an additional cash retainer of $40,000; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms. Wagner, received an additional cash retainer of $35,000. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments. &#160; Equity-Based Awards &#160; A substantial portion of each Non-Employee Director&#8217;s annual retainer is in the form of equity awards. Under the Director Plan, Non-Employee Directors are granted restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders (each, an &#8220;Annual Director Award&#8221;). All Annual Director Awards vest on February 1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. In 2025, the Director Plan was amended to increase the Annual Director Award value to $310,000. At Dr. Levinson&#8217;s request, the Board maintained his Annual Director Award at $275,000.&#160;With the exception of Dr. Levinson, the number of RSUs underlying each Annual Director Award for each Non-Employee Director in 2025 was 1,255, which was determined by dividing $310,000 by the per share closing price of Apple&#8217;s common stock on the grant date, rounded to the nearest whole share. Dr. Levinson&#8217;s Annual Director Award was determined by dividing $275,000 by the per share closing price of Apple&#8217;s common stock on the grant date, rounded to the nearest whole share. &#160; A Non-Employee Director who is newly appointed to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders will receive a grant of RSUs upon appointment (an &#8220;Initial Director Award&#8221;), except that a Non-Employee Director who first joins the Board on or after February 1 of a particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year, or a director who was an employee of Apple immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, will not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based on the portion of the vesting period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest on the next February 1 following the grant of the award, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. &#160; Each RSU award granted under the Director Plan is credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject to the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for the dividend. The amounts credited to each RSU are referred to as &#8220;dividend equivalents.&#8221; Any dividend equivalents credited to RSUs granted under the Director Plan are subject to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. The dividend equivalents are meant to treat the RSU award holders consistently with shareholders. &#160; Equipment and Other Business-Related Programs &#160; Apple has an equipment program for the Board under which each Non-Employee Director is eligible to receive, upon request and free of charge, one of each new product introduced by Apple, and is eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Each Non-Employee Director is also eligible to participate in Apple&#8217;s matching gifts program to the same extent as Apple employees. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 31 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Deferred Compensation Plan &#160; We maintain the Apple Inc.

The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded and unsecured. We do not provide any matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan or allow for deferral of RSUs. Ms. Lozano deferred a portion of her fees earned into the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2025. &#160; Stock Ownership Guidelines &#160; Apple has stock ownership guidelines for our CEO, executive officers, and Non-Employee Directors. Under the guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected, within five years after joining the Board, to own shares of Apple&#8217;s common stock that have a value equal to five times their annual cash retainer for serving as a director. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual&#8217;s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual&#8217;s spouse, or the individual&#8217;s children.

For our part, the People and Compensation Committee remains focused on supporting Apple&#8217;s world class leadership team in guiding the Company&#8217;s success. &#160; In addition, the People and Compensation Committee maintains its oversight of Apple&#8217;s executive compensation program, built to reward leaders for their strong performance and acumen navigating an ever-changing business environment. That includes Apple&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook, whose remarkable leadership has been instrumental in Apple&#8217;s track record of success and unmatched innovation on behalf of its users. &#160; As a committee, we&#8217;re charged with ensuring that the compensation of Apple&#8217;s CEO reflects this exceptional record. As we&#8217;ve previously communicated, we intend to set Tim&#8217;s compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at Apple&#8217;s peer companies relative to the company&#8217;s size, scope, and success, and his 2025 compensation once again falls within this targeted range. Our shareholders have overwhelmingly approved of this approach, as demonstrated by the support for Apple&#8217;s Say on Pay proposal at the 2025 Annual Meeting. &#160; As always, we value shareholder feedback, and we appreciate the continued shareholder support of Apple and its vital work of empowering people through technology and, in doing so, enriching their lives. &#160; Sincerely, &#160; Andrea Jung&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alex Gorsky&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Art Levinson &#160; &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 37 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Compensation Discussion and Analysis &#160; This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (&#8220;CD&amp;A&#8221;) explains the guiding principles,&#160;policies, and practices upon which our executive compensation program is based and the 2025 compensation paid to our named executive officers. &#160; Summary of Named Executive Officer Compensation &#160; 2025 was an extraordinary year with an all-time revenue record of $416.2 billion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. Guided by our exceptional leadership team, we strive to give the best to our users, and we&#8217;re continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will transform our future. &#160; Motivating and retaining an exceptional leadership team is a key factor in enabling Apple&#8217;s long-term success. Our executive compensation program is designed to retain strong, values-driven leaders. We have clear guiding principles and sound compensation policies and practices that align the pay of our named executive officers with the Company&#8217;s financial performance and shareholder returns, taking into consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple&#8217;s business.&#160; &#160; Our 2025 named executive officers include Kevan Parekh and Sabih Khan for the first time. Mr. Parekh and Mr. Khan transitioned into the roles of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, during 2025 as part of planned transitions for these roles. Mr. Parekh previously served as Apple&#8217;s Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and joined the executive team in January 2025. Mr. Khan previously served as Apple&#8217;s Senior Vice President of Operations, and joined the executive team in 2019. &#160; Our 2025 Named Executive Officers &#160; Tim Cook Chief Executive Officer &#160; Kevan Parekh Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &#160; Kate Adams Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary &#160; Sabih Khan Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer &#160; Luca Maestri Former Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &#160; Deirdre O&#8217;Brien Senior Vice President, Retail&#160;+&#160;People &#160; The compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2025 reflects their contributions to Apple&#8217;s success and continues to demonstrate alignment with Apple&#8217;s strong financial results and the interests of our shareholders. The vast majority of our named executive officers&#8217; compensation is at-risk and delivered through short-term cash incentives and long-term equity awards. The performance-based RSU awards that vested in 2025 reflect Apple&#8217;s strong stock price performance for the period from the start of 2022 through the end of 2024. Apple&#8217;s total shareholder return relative to other companies in the S&amp;P 500 (&#8220;Relative TSR&#8221;) was at the 81.20th percentile for this performance period. As a result, in 2025, our named executive officers with performance-based RSUs granted in 2022 vested in 187% of the target performance-based RSUs. We also reported net sales of $416.2 billion and operating income results of $133.1 billion for 2025, resulting in a maximum payout for each of our named executive officers under the Apple Inc. Executive Cash Incentive Plan (the &#8220;Cash Incentive Plan&#8221;).&#160; &#160; Say on Pay Advisory Vote Results &#160; At the 2025 Annual Meeting, 92% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal were in favor of our executive compensation program, demonstrating significant shareholder support for the overall structure of our executive compensation program and the compensation paid to our named executive officers for 2024. The People and Compensation Committee considered this strong shareholder support and did not make any changes to the overall structure of our executive compensation program and maintained Mr. Cook&#8217;s total target compensation between the 80th to 90th percentile range of target CEO pay at our 2025 primary peer companies given our relative size, scope, and success. &#160; 38 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Executive Compensation Policies and Practices &#160; We are committed to sound executive compensation policies and practices, as highlighted in the following table. &#160; Prohibition on hedging, pledging, and short sales &#160; We prohibit short sales, transactions in derivatives, hedging, and pledging of Apple securities by our named executive officers. Stock ownership guidelines &#160; We have robust stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers, including a ten times annual base salary requirement for our CEO. Compensation recoupment policies &#160; We have a policy for the recovery of any erroneously awarded performance-based incentive compensation, as required under Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq listing standards.&#160;In addition, we maintain a discretionary recoupment policy applicable to our named executive officers and our broader executive team that allows for recovery of annual cash incentives, time and performance-based equity awards, or other amounts that may be paid with respect to awards in certain events, including for certain acts of misconduct by our named executive officers. No repricing &#160; We do not allow repricing of stock options without shareholder approval. Limited perquisites &#160; We provide limited perquisites to our named executive officers. For example, for security and efficiency purposes, Mr. Cook is provided personal security protection and is required by the Board to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. No tax gross-ups on perquisites &#160; We do not provide tax gross-ups for the limited perquisites provided to our named executive officers. No change of control payments &#160; We do not provide change of control payments or gross-ups of related excise taxes. Vesting requirements for dividend equivalents &#160; Dividend equivalents will not be paid unless and until the vesting and performance conditions for the underlying equity award are met. At-will employment &#160; Our named executive officers do not have employment contracts and are employed at will. No pension or other supplemental benefits &#160; We do not provide pension, supplemental executive health, or insurance benefits. Annual compensation risk assessment &#160; The People and Compensation Committee oversees an annual risk assessment of our compensation program. Independent compensation consultant &#160; The People and Compensation Committee directly retains an independent compensation consultant that performs no services for Apple other than services for the People and Compensation Committee. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 39 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Guiding Compensation Principles &#160; Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward outstanding financial performance, retain talented, values-driven leaders, and promote teamwork in a straightforward and effective way. Our clear guiding principles and sound compensation policies and practices align the pay of our named executive officers with Company performance, taking into consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple&#8217;s business. &#160; Team-Based Approach &#160; We apply a unique team-based approach to the compensation of our named executive officers to emphasize their shared responsibility for Apple&#8217;s overall success. This approach recognizes the exceptional experience, leadership, and value each of our named executive officers contributes to Apple&#8217;s leadership team, with CEO compensation awarded at a higher level to reflect the additional scope and complexity of that role. &#160; Performance Expectations &#160; The vast majority of our executive pay is tied to Apple&#8217;s&#160;financial performance to ensure alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders. Each year, we establish clear, quantitative financial goals for our named executive officers that are intended to drive Apple&#8217;s overall success. &#160; Emphasis on Long-Term Equity Awards &#160; We emphasize long-term performance, retention, and alignment between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders by allocating a significant portion of our named executive officers&#8217; compensation to long-term equity awards. Performance-based RSUs reward long-term TSR out-performance relative to other companies. Time-based RSUs are also an important component of long-term equity awards because they promote stability and retention of our exceptional leadership team while vesting over a longer time frame of approximately 4.5 years. &#160; People and Compensation Committee Considerations When Setting Executive Compensation &#160; &#9679; Managing Apple for the long term &#9679; Aligning pay with performance &#9679; Retaining exceptional, values-driven leaders &#9679; Considering shareholder interests and feedback &#9679; Maintaining Apple&#8217;s unique team-based approach &#160; Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process &#160; Establishing appropriate compensation and incentive opportunities for our named executive officers is a core responsibility of the People and Compensation Committee.&#160;The People and Compensation Committee consists entirely of independent directors who review and approve the compensation and incentives of Apple&#8217;s named executive officers each year. It also administers Apple&#8217;s employee stock plans. The People and Compensation Committee may delegate its authority under its charter to Apple&#8217;s officers or employees, or any of its individual members, except to the extent otherwise prohibited by SEC or Nasdaq rules, or other applicable laws. The People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s authority to grant discretionary equity awards under our employee stock plans or to take any other action with respect to equity awards (other than the performance of ministerial duties) may not be delegated to Apple&#8217;s management or others. &#160; 40 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; The Role of the Compensation Consultant &#160; The People and Compensation Committee selects and retains the services of its own independent compensation consultant and annually reviews the consultant&#8217;s performance. As part of the review process, the People and Compensation Committee considers the independence of the consultant in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. &#160; During 2025, the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, provided no services to Apple other than services for the People and Compensation Committee and worked with Apple&#8217;s management, as directed by the People and Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the People and Compensation Committee is responsible. At the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s request, Pay Governance regularly attends the People and Compensation Committee meetings. Pay Governance also communicates with the members of the People and Compensation Committee outside committee meetings regarding matters related to the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s responsibilities. &#160; In 2025, the People and Compensation Committee generally sought input from Pay Governance on Apple&#8217;s compensation programs, including: external market factors; shareholder engagement; overall compensation program design; evolving compensation trends; appropriate market reference points; and market compensation data. Pay Governance also consulted with the People and Compensation Committee regarding the amount and form of compensation for our CEO and other named executive officers. &#160; Role of Peer Groups &#160; The People and Compensation Committee reviews and approves the composition of a primary peer group each year to serve as the market reference point for compensation opportunity comparison purposes, to inform its decision-making process, and to set total target compensation levels that it believes are competitive and commensurate with Apple&#8217;s relative size, scope, and success. &#160; Apple remains significantly larger than most other companies with $416.2 billion in revenue for 2025 and market capitalization of $3.8 trillion, as of the last trading day of 2025. This was approximately seven times the market capitalization and five times the revenue of the median peer companies in our 2025 peer group, which were $512.7 billion for market capitalization and $77.2 billion for revenue, respectively.&#160; &#160; Market Capitalization &#160; Revenue &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Market capitalization for our primary peers is the amount reported by Bloomberg L.P. as of September 26, 2025, the last trading day of 2025. Revenue is based on the trailing 12&#160;months&#8217; revenue for Apple and each of our primary peers ending closest to our 2025 fiscal year-end.&#160; &#160; Our primary peer group consists of large U.S.-based, stand-alone, publicly traded companies in the technology, media, and internet services industries that, in the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s view, compete with Apple for executive talent. Commensurate with Apple&#8217;s size and scope, the People and Compensation Committee reviews Mr. Cook&#8217;s total target compensation against the annualized total target CEO pay of our primary peer group, focusing on the 80th to 90th percentiles of peer CEO pay when setting Mr. Cook&#8217;s pay. Other than for Mr. Cook, the People and Compensation Committee does not set compensation components for our named executive officers to meet specific benchmarks as compared to our peer companies. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 41 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; The threshold revenue and market capitalization requirements for a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2025 were $20 billion and $100 billion, respectively. The chart below lists the companies in our 2025 primary peer group. &#160; &#160; &#160; 2025 Primary Peer Group &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Alphabet Cisco Mastercard NVIDIA Verizon Amazon Comcast Meta Oracle Visa AT&amp;T Disney Microsoft Qualcomm Warner Bros. Discovery Broadcom Intel Netflix Salesforce &#160; &#160; For many years, a secondary peer group of companies was developed as an additional reference set to assess pay practices but not to benchmark pay levels or structure. This secondary peer group was composed of companies that: have iconic brands or are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development and innovation for growth, and require highly skilled employees. For 2025, this group included AbbVie, Coca-Cola, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nike, Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Starbucks, and UnitedHealth Group. While other points of reference may be considered from time to time, in 2025 the People and Compensation Committee determined to eliminate consideration of a formal secondary peer group for 2026. The People and Compensation Committee also determined a primary peer group solely focused on the technology and media sectors would provide a more tailored source of competitive pay data and removed AT&amp;T, Mastercard, Verizon, and Visa from the 2026 primary peer group. &#160; CEO Peer Pay Positioning &#160; The People and Compensation Committee reviewed Mr. Cook&#8217;s performance and the annualized total target compensation of CEOs in our primary peer group, and consulted with its independent compensation consultant, prior to setting Mr. Cook&#8217;s 2025 total target compensation, which remains within the 80th to 90th percentile range relative to the annualized target CEO pay of our primary peer group companies. Mr. Cook&#8217;s consistently exceptional performance, Apple&#8217;s size and scope, and shareholder feedback support the positioning of Mr. Cook&#8217;s total target compensation within this targeted range. &#160; &#160; To determine Mr. Cook&#8217;s total target compensation relative to other CEOs in our primary peer group, the People and Compensation Committee considered the annualized total target compensation opportunity (which includes base salary, target cash incentive opportunities, and target value of equity awards) for CEOs at each of the primary peer companies using publicly available filings. Any primary peer companies with CEOs that did not receive direct incentive compensation were excluded from the analysis. In addition, long-term equity awards were annualized to account for variability in granting practices. As a result, the values for total target compensation used in the analysis may differ from proxy reported summary compensation table values, which reflect base salary, earned cash incentives, and the accounting grant date value of equity awards as calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 718. &#160; 42 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; The Role of the Chief Executive Officer &#160; At the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s request, Mr. Cook provides input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers. The People and Compensation Committee considers Mr. Cook&#8217;s evaluation and his direct knowledge of each named executive officer&#8217;s performance and contributions when setting compensation. Mr. Cook is not present during People and Compensation Committee deliberations or voting regarding his own compensation. &#160; The Role of Shareholders &#160; Shareholders are provided the opportunity to cast an annual Say on Pay advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Shareholder feedback is an important part of the compensation-setting process. Apple has a long history of proactively engaging with shareholders throughout the year to understand their perspectives on significant issues, including Company performance, strategy, and executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee values the views of our shareholders as expressed both through annual Say on Pay advisory votes and our ongoing outreach and engagement process. &#160; At the 2025 Annual Meeting, 92% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal supported our executive compensation program. The People and Compensation Committee regularly considers shareholder feedback and the results of Say on Pay votes when setting compensation for our named executive officers. &#160; Components of Named Executive Officer Total Target Compensation &#160; The total target compensation of our named executive officers has three basic components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards. &#160; Annual Base Salary &#160; Base salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation intended to attract and retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers, the People and Compensation Committee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant and Apple&#8217;s financial performance and size relative to peer companies. &#160; Annual Cash Incentive &#160; Our annual cash incentive program is a performance-based, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#8217; compensation. Short-term cash incentive awards are granted under the Cash Incentive Plan. Variable payouts are designed to motivate our named executive officers to deliver strong annual financial results. Additional details regarding the Cash Incentive Plan for 2025 can be found below in the section entitled &#8220;Cash Incentive Plan &#8211; 2025 Financial Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities.&#8221; &#160; Long-Term Equity Awards &#160; We pay for performance and manage Apple for the long term. Consistent with this approach and our guiding compensation principles, the vast majority of our named executive officers&#8217; total target compensation is granted in the form of long-term equity incentives that emphasize long-term shareholder value creation and the retention of a strong executive leadership team through a mix of performance-based and time-based RSU awards. Additional details regarding these awards can be found below in the section entitled &#8220;2025 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results.&#8221; &#160; RSU awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive team over the longer term. Vesting schedules for the time-based awards granted to our named executive officers are generally longer than nearly all of those at our peer companies and in the broader industry. &#160; RSU awards with performance-based vesting are a substantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#8217; compensation tied to Apple&#8217;s long-term performance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest depends entirely on Apple&#8217;s Relative TSR for the performance period. The People and Compensation Committee chose Relative TSR as it continues to be an objective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and to align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 43 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Summary of CEO Total Target Compensation &#160; The People and Compensation Committee evaluates our executive compensation program and the total target value of Mr. Cook&#8217;s compensation prior to the start of each fiscal year. In determining the appropriate amount of each compensation component for 2025, the People and Compensation Committee considered numerous factors with the Board and its independent compensation consultant, including Mr. Cook&#8217;s consistently outstanding leadership, the immense scope and complexity of his role as Apple&#8217;s CEO, the Board&#8217;s confidence in his long-term strategic decisions, the Company&#8217;s 2024 financial results, and shareholder feedback. Balancing the size, scope, and success of Apple relative to our primary peer group, Mr. Cook&#8217;s own pay positioning relative to the CEOs in our primary peer group, and a desire to continue creating&#160;meaningful performance and retention incentives, the People and Compensation Committee set Mr. Cook&#8217;s total target compensation for 2025 within the desired pay positioning range and at the same level as his 2024 total target compensation as shown below. &#160; 2025 Total Target CEO Compensation: $59&#160;million Base Salary: &#160;$3&#160;million Mr. Cook&#8217;s base salary has remained the same since 2016 &#160; &#160; Target Cash Incentive Plan Opportunity: &#160;$6&#160;million Mr. Cook&#8217;s target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity for 2025 remained at 200% of his base salary &#160; &#160; Target Equity Award Value: &#160;$50&#160;million Award Mix:&#160; 25/75 Mr. Cook was granted an equity award with 25% subject to time-based vesting and 75% subject to performance-based vesting &#160; &#160; No changes were made to the amount of Mr. Cook&#8217;s base salary or annual cash incentive payout opportunity for 2025. The People and Compensation Committee also maintained the total target value of Mr. Cook&#8217;s equity award for 2025 at $50 million (&#8220;2025 Equity Award&#8221;). The 2025 Equity Award value and structure is unchanged from the equity award he received for 2024, with 75% of the award granted in the form of performance-based RSUs. This structure continues to emphasize long-term shareholder growth and alignment while recognizing the growth and success Mr. Cook has continually delivered to shareholders during his tenure and the ongoing impact of his leadership on Apple&#8217;s short- and long-term success. &#160; Equity awards granted to Mr. Cook are designed to focus on Apple&#8217;s long-term strategy and performance while creating meaningful incentives aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. During his tenure, the vast majority of Mr. Cook&#8217;s compensation has been delivered through long-term equity awards. The size of the equity awards Mr. Cook has been granted aligns with Apple&#8217;s growth, success, and the tremendous value delivered to our shareholders under his leadership. Since Mr. Cook was promoted to CEO in 2011 and through the end of 2025, Apple&#8217;s cumulative TSR increased approximately 2,162%, significantly outpacing the S&amp;P 500, and Apple&#8217;s market capitalization grew by more than $3.4 trillion. &#160; &#160; Cumulative TSR, includes reinvestment of dividends &#160; The People and Compensation Committee reviewed the primary peer CEO benchmark data and considered Mr. Cook&#8217;s continued exceptional performance when evaluating Mr. Cook&#8217;s total target compensation and our executive compensation program for 2026 and made no changes to the amount or structure of Mr. Cook&#8217;s 2026 total target compensation. &#160; 44 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Summary of Other Named Executive Officer Total Target Compensation &#160; The total target compensation of our five other named executive officers, Kevan Parekh, Kate Adams, Sabih Khan, Luca Maestri, and Deirdre O&#8217;Brien consists of the three basic components of our executive compensation program &#8212; base salary, a Cash Incentive Plan opportunity, and long-term equity awards &#8212; in a straightforward and effective way. &#160; Taking into account individual and Company performance, as well as shareholder feedback, which has consistently&#160; confirmed support for the amount and structure of our other named executive officers&#8217; compensation, the People and Compensation Committee determined that the target compensation of our named executive officers remains competitive, continues to be commensurate with Apple&#8217;s performance and significantly larger size and scope compared to other companies, and is appropriately aligned with our guiding principles and the scope of each named executive officer&#8217;s role. Since 2014, the total target compensation for our named executive officers has generally comprised an annual base salary of $1,000,000, a target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity of 200% of base salary, and a target equity award of $20,000,000. Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan and Ms. O&#8217;Brien each received total target compensation at this level for 2025, with their equity awards granted in the form of RSUs balanced with 50% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 50% subject to time-based vesting, to encourage long-term performance, retention, and alignment with shareholders&#8217; interests. &#160; In August 2024, as part of a planned succession, Apple announced that Luca Maestri would transition from the CFO role, and Kevan Parekh, who previously served as Apple&#8217;s Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis, would become Apple&#8217;s CFO and join the executive team on January 1, 2025. Mr. Maestri&#8217;s and Mr. Parekh&#8217;s 2025 total target compensation has the same structure as our other named executive officers&#8217; 2025 compensation, including base salary, Cash Incentive Plan opportunity, and long-term equity awards, with their amounts pro-rated based on their time in their respective roles during fiscal 2025.&#160; &#160; The total target compensation for Mr. Maestri for 2025 comprised an annual base salary of $1,000,000 that was reduced to $750,000 as of January 1, 2025, a target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity of 100% of paid base salary, and a target equity award for his previous role as CFO of $5,000,000 with 50% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 50% subject to time-based vesting. Mr. Maestri continues to report to Mr. Cook and lead Apple&#8217;s Corporate Services teams, and his 2025 annual time-based RSU award for this role had a target value of $7,500,000 with the same four-year vesting schedule generally applicable to our non-executive team employees.&#160; &#160; The total target compensation for Mr. Parekh for 2025 comprised an annual base salary of $610,000 increased to $1,000,000 as of January 1, 2025, a target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity of 175% of paid base salary, and a target equity award of $16,750,000 with 50% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 50% subject to time-based vesting. &#160; Additional details regarding our named executive officers&#8217; 2025 compensation can be found below in the sections entitled &#8220;Cash Incentive Plan &#8212; 2025 Financial Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities&#8221; and &#8220;2025 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results.&#8221; &#160; Cash Incentive Plan &#8211; 2025 Financial Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities &#160; Our Cash Incentive Plan awards are designed to motivate and reward our named executive officers for delivering strong performance against annual financial goals. As in prior years, the People and Compensation Committee chose net sales and operating income, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as the financial performance measures for the 2025 Cash Incentive Plan awards. Net sales and operating income continue to reflect commonly recognized key measures of overall Company performance and profitability and are drivers of shareholder value creation. &#160; Payouts for our named executive officers under the Cash Incentive Plan are first determined quantitatively based on an equal weighting of the net sales and operating income performance measures. The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures was 100% of annual base salary for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Maestri and Mr. Parekh due to the transition in their respective roles. Threshold performance would result in a payout equal to 50% of target and maximum performance would result in a payout equal to 200% of target for each of the performance measures. If the threshold goal is not achieved for a financial performance measure, there is no payout for that measure. The total payout opportunity for each financial performance measure is capped at 200%. Payouts for our named executive officers are linearly interpolated for achievement between goal levels. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 45 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; 2025 Financial Performance Goals &#160; The People and Compensation Committee considers factors relevant to the current fiscal year when it sets the net sales and operating income goals for the annual Cash Incentive Plan awards because each year presents a unique set of challenges and business conditions for our executives to navigate. Financial results from prior years are used as a reference point, but the annual goals are set to align pay with performance that would reflect strong financial results commensurate with the projected business and economic conditions for the current fiscal year. The goal-setting process for 2025 presented a unique set of challenges due to an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, including trade policies and impacts and foreign currency fluctuations. &#160; As part of its goal-setting process for 2025, the People and Compensation Committee assessed a range of business scenarios that could impact net sales and operating income results for the year, considering multiple factors and operational risks, and once again focusing on the underlying business performance rather than the absolute growth rates. Acknowledging the risks, challenges, and uncertainties in the 2025 projections, as well as the exceptional efforts that would be required of our executive team to continue to deliver results at a sustained level year-over-year, the People and Compensation Committee set net sales and operating income goals at appropriately rigorous levels for the year. For net sales, the threshold, target, and maximum goals were $380 billion, $391 billion, and $402 billion, respectively. For operating income, the threshold, target, and maximum goals were $113 billion, $118.5&#160;billion, and $124 billion, respectively. The threshold goals represented the minimum level of achievement for a named executive officer to receive an annual cash incentive payout. The target goals represented an underlying growth rate that, while challenging to achieve based on the considerations noted above, would also represent strong financial performance on an underlying basis commensurate with the target payout opportunity. The maximum goals represented exceptional financial performance for the year, based on the business scenarios considered. &#160; 2025 Financial Performance Results &#160; &#160; Net Sales ($B) &#160; &#160; Operating Income ($B) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For 2025, we reported net sales of $416.2 billion and operating income of $133.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of six percent ($25.2 billion) and eight percent ($9.9 billion), respectively. These achievements far exceeded expectations for the year and resulted in a maximum payout opportunity.&#160;In evaluating the performance of the Company and the named executive officers in retrospect at the end of the year, the People and Compensation Committee evaluated the results in the context of the approved goals, as well as alternate scenarios considered at the time the goals were set.&#160;2025 was an extraordinary year with an all-time revenue record of $416.2 billion, with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. These results reflect the tremendous customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services, as well as our deep commitment to innovation.&#160;The net sales and operating income results delivered for the year exceeded the maximum financial goals considered, resulting in a maximum payout opportunity for each named executive officer. Accordingly, the People and Compensation Committee awarded maximum Cash Incentive Plan payouts to each of our named executive officers. &#160; 46 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; 2025 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results &#160; When setting the value of equity awards for our named executive officers, the People and Compensation Committee considers the size and performance of Apple relative to peer companies and the scope of our named executive officers&#8217; roles. Each named executive officer, other than Mr. Cook, was granted a long-term equity award on September 29, 2024 of 50% performance-based and 50% time-based RSUs. Mr.&#160;Maestri was also granted a time-based RSU award for his current role of Vice President, Corporate Services. Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September 29, 2024 of 75% performance-based and 25% time-based RSUs. The equity awards granted in 2025 were granted under, and subject to, the terms of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (&#8220;2022 Plan&#8221;). &#160; 2025 Performance-Based RSUs &#160; The People and Compensation Committee continued to use Relative TSR as the metric for performance-based RSUs granted during 2025, with the S&amp;P 500 as the comparative group because it continues to be an objective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and aligns the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value. &#160; Performance-based RSUs are a substantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#8217; compensation tied to Apple&#8217;s long-term performance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest, if any, depends entirely on Relative TSR for the applicable performance period. To earn the target number of performance-based RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the 55th percentile of the S&amp;P 500.&#160; &#160; We measure Relative TSR based on the change in each company&#8217;s stock price during the applicable performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. A 20-day trading averaging period is used to determine the beginning and ending stock price values used to calculate the total shareholder return of Apple and the other companies in the S&amp;P 500. The 20-day trading averaging period mitigates the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period. The change in stock price value from the beginning to the end of the period is divided by the beginning stock price value to determine TSR.&#160; &#160; The performance-based RSUs granted on September 29, 2024, have a three-year performance period from the beginning of 2025 through the end of 2027. Subject to the terms of the award agreements, between zero and 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs will vest on October 1, 2027, depending on Apple&#8217;s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the performance period, as follows: &#160; Relative TSR Percentile v. S&amp;P&#160;500 Companies Performance-Based RSUs Vesting as a Percentage of Target 85th&#160;Percentile or Above 200% 55th&#160;Percentile 100% 25th&#160;Percentile 25% Below 25th 0% &#160; If Apple&#8217;s TSR for the performance period is negative, the number of performance-based RSUs that vest will be capped at 100% of the target, regardless of our Relative TSR percentile ranking. If Apple&#8217;s Relative TSR percentile ranking is above the 25th percentile and between the other levels shown in the table above, the portion of the performance-based RSUs that vest will be linearly interpolated between the two nearest vesting percentages. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 47 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; The target number of performance-based RSUs granted to our named executive officers was determined by dividing the target performance-based RSU value by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The target value of the performance-based RSUs for each of our named executive officers is as follows: &#160; Named Executive Officer Target Performance-Based RSU Value Tim Cook $37,500,000 Kevan Parekh $8,375,000 Kate Adams $10,000,000 Sabih Khan $10,000,000 Luca Maestri $2,500,000 Deirdre O&#8217;Brien $10,000,000 &#160; The grant date fair values of these RSUs are reported in the &#8220;Summary Compensation Table&#8212;2025, 2024, and 2023.&#8221; &#160; Performance-Based RSU 2025 Results &#160; On October 1, 2024, Mr. Cook, Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan, Mr. Maestri, and Ms. O&#8217;Brien each vested in performance-based RSUs that were granted on September 26, 2021. Between zero and 200% of the target number of these performance-based RSUs were scheduled to vest based on Apple&#8217;s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the applicable performance period, with a maximum 200% vesting for performance at or above the 85th percentile. &#160; For the three-year performance period from September 26, 2021 through September 28, 2024, Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan, Mr. Maestri, and Ms. O&#8217;Brien each vested in 127,282 performance-based RSUs, and Mr. Cook vested in 477,301 performance-based RSUs, in each case representing 187% of the target number of performance-based RSUs granted. &#160; &#160; Relative TSR Percentile Ranking for Three-Year Performance Period TSR Results for Three-Year Performance Period Apple 81.20th&#160;Percentile 57.88% S&amp;P&#160;500 Companies 85th&#160;Percentile 65.57% 55th&#160;Percentile 20.99% 25th&#160;Percentile -9.41% Below 25th &lt; -9.41% &#160; 2025 Time-Based RSUs &#160; Equity awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive team over the longer term. Based on analysis from the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s independent compensation consultant, we set the vesting schedules for time-based RSUs granted to our named executive officers longer than the vast majority of those at our peer companies and companies in the broader market. &#160; Time-based RSUs granted under the long-term equity award to our named executive officers on September 29, 2024 generally vest in three equal annual installments over approximately four and one-half years, with the first installment vesting on April 1, 2027 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date), subject to the terms of the award agreements. &#160; The separate time-based RSU award granted to Mr. Maestri on September 29, 2024 will vest semi-annually in eight equal installments over four years. The first installment vested on April 15, 2025 and the remaining installments vest every six months thereafter, subject to the terms of the award agreement. &#160; 48 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; The number of time-based RSUs granted to our named executive officers was determined by dividing the target time-based RSU value by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The target value of the time-based RSUs for each of our named executive officers is as follows: &#160; Named Executive Officer Target Time-Based RSU Value Tim Cook $12,500,000 Kevan Parekh $8,375,000 Kate Adams $10,000,000 Sabih Khan $10,000,000 Luca Maestri&#160; $2,500,000 $7,500,000 Deirdre O&#8217;Brien $10,000,000 &#160; The grant date fair value for these RSUs is reported in the &#8220;Summary Compensation Table&#8212;2025, 2024, and 2023.&#8221; &#160; Dividend Equivalents &#160; All equity awards granted to our employees in 2025 have dividend equivalent rights. The dividend equivalents will only pay out if and to the extent that the time-based vesting and performance-based vesting conditions have been met for the underlying RSUs. &#160; Other Compensation and Benefits &#160; Our named executive officers are also eligible to participate in our Apple Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;), health and welfare programs, 401(k) plan, tenure-based service awards, matching gifts, vacation cash-out, product discount, and other compensation and benefit programs on the same basis as other employees. Items or services provided to our named executive officers that may be considered perquisites are limited,&#160;as discussed below and reported in &#8220;Summary Compensation Table&#8212;2025, 2024, and 2023.&#8221; &#160; Deferred Compensation Plan &#160; Our named executive officers are eligible to defer a portion of their base salary and their annual Cash Incentive Plan payout under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, as discussed below in &#8220;Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation&#8212;2025.&#8221; &#160; Other Personal Benefits &#160; We provide risk-based security services for our employees, including our named executive officers, as determined to be necessary by our security team. We consider the security measures provided to our named executive officers to be reasonable and necessary expenses for the benefit of Apple and not a personal benefit. In the interests of security and efficiency based on our global profile and the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook&#8217;s role as CEO, the Board also requires that Mr. Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr. Cook recognizes imputed taxable income and is not provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of private aircraft. On occasion, our named executive officers, and personal guests, may attend company-sponsored or business-related entertainment events. Although their attendance serves a business purpose, it may not be directly related to their role and responsibilities. As a result, our named executive officers may recognize imputed taxable income related to their attendance at such events depending on their respective roles and responsibilities, and we do not provide an associated tax reimbursement or gross-up. In accordance with SEC disclosure rules, the aggregate incremental costs associated with these activities, if any, is reported in the &#8220;Summary Compensation Table&#8212;2025, 2024, and 2023.&#8221; &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 49 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Compensation Upon Termination of Employment &#160; Our named executive officers do not have employment contracts or guaranteed cash severance arrangements and are not entitled to acceleration of their equity awards or any other payments upon a change in control. &#160; The time-based RSU agreements for all our employees, including Mr. Cook, generally provide for full accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death unless otherwise necessary or required to address certain foreign laws. The time-based RSU agreements for all our employees, other than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to disability. The performance-based RSU award agreements for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death or disability. &#160; The time-based and performance-based RSU agreements for Mr. Cook provide for continued full vesting upon a termination due to disability, with settlement occurring on the originally scheduled vesting dates. Mr. Cook&#8217;s outstanding equity awards include a retirement vesting provision approved by the People and Compensation Committee in recognition of the unique impact of his leadership decisions on the long-term growth and success of Apple and to facilitate thoughtful succession planning when appropriate. Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and completing at least 10 years of service with Apple. Mr. Cook has met these requirements.&#160; &#160; In the event of Mr. Cook&#8217;s termination due to retirement on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, his 2025 time-based RSUs are structured to vest on a pro rata basis based on the length of his employment between the grant date and his termination date. Unless otherwise determined by the People and Compensation Committee, Mr. Cook&#8217;s outstanding performance-based RSU agreements provide for a continued right to receive the full number of earned shares underlying the performance-based RSUs on the original vesting dates upon a termination due to death, disability, or termination of employment due to retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook retires on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, the shares underlying his time-based and performance-based RSU awards will be released on the originally scheduled vesting date, subject to the attainment of the performance goals for the performance-based RSUs. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook&#8217;s equity awards and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such awards are not accelerated upon retirement. &#160; Governance and Other Considerations &#160; Recoupment of Compensation &#160; The terms of all outstanding time-based and performance-based RSU awards held by our named executive officers in 2025 allow us to recoup any shares or other amounts that may be paid in respect of RSUs if a named executive officer engages in certain acts of misconduct. The compensation recoupment policy also applies to the awards and payouts granted under the Cash Incentive Plan to our named executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in the event a named executive officer commits a felony while employed by Apple or if Apple is required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of the named executive officer&#8217;s misconduct. Apple may also recover compensation in the event a named executive officer, while employed by Apple or at any time thereafter, engages in a breach of confidentiality; materially breaches any agreement with Apple; or commits an act of theft, embezzlement, or fraud. Apple also adopted a recovery policy in accordance with Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq listing standards, which mandates the recovery of certain erroneously paid performance-based incentive compensation that may be received by our Section 16 officers on or after October 2, 2023 and during the three completed fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which a financial restatement determination is made if Apple has a qualifying financial restatement, subject to limited exceptions. &#160; Prohibition on Hedging, Pledging, and Short Sales &#160; We prohibit short sales, hedging, and transactions in derivatives of Apple securities for all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, and consultants. In addition, we prohibit pledging of Apple stock as collateral by directors and executive officers of Apple. We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange funds. &#160; 50 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Stock Ownership Guidelines &#160; Under our stock ownership guidelines, Mr. Cook is expected to own shares of Apple stock that have a value equal to 10 times his annual base salary. All other executive officers are expected to own shares that have a value equal to three times their annual base salary within five years of first becoming subject to the guidelines. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with or separately by the individual&#8217;s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual&#8217;s spouse, or the individual&#8217;s children. Currently, each 2025 named executive officer holds shares in excess of these guidelines. &#160; Equity Award Grant Practices &#160; Equity awards are discretionary and are generally granted to our named executive officers on the first day of the applicable fiscal year . In certain circumstances, including the hiring or promotion of an officer, the People and Compensation Committee may approve grants to be effective at other times. Apple does not currently grant stock options to its employees. Eligible employees, including our named executive officers, may voluntarily enroll in the ESPP and receive an option to purchase shares at a discount using payroll deductions accumulated during the prior six-month period. Purchase dates under the ESPP are generally the last trading days in July and January. The People and Compensation Committee did not take material non-public information into account when determining the timing and terms of equity awards in 2025 , and Apple does not time the disclosure of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. &#160; Risk Considerations &#160; In establishing and reviewing Apple&#8217;s executive compensation program, the People and Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and has concluded that it does not. See the section entitled &#8220;Corporate Governance&#8211;Board Oversight&#8221; above for an additional discussion of risk considerations. &#160; People and Compensation Committee Report &#160; The People and Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the disclosures contained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based on this review and discussion, the People and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the section entitled &#8220;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8221; be included in this Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting. &#160; Members&#160;of&#160;the&#160;People and Compensation&#160;Committee &#160; Andrea&#160;Jung&#160;(Chair)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alex Gorsky&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Art&#160;Levinson &#160; &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 51 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Executive Compensation Tables &#160; Summary Compensation Table&#8212;2025, 2024, and 2023 &#160; The following table, footnotes, and related narrative show information regarding the total compensation of each named executive officer for 2025, 2024, and 2023. &#160; &#160; Name and Principal Position &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Year &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Salary ($) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Stock Awards (1) ($) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation (2) ($) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; All Other Compensation ($) &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Total ($) Tim&#160;Cook Chief Executive Officer &#160; 2025 &#160; 3,000,000 &#160; 57,535,293 &#160; 12,000,000 &#160; 1,759,518 (3)(4) &#160; &#160; 74,294,811 &#160; 2024 &#160; 3,000,000 &#160; 58,088,946 &#160; 12,000,000 &#160; 1,520,856 &#160; &#160; 74,609,802 &#160; 2023 &#160; 3,000,000 &#160; 46,970,283 &#160; 10,713,450 &#160; 2,526,112 &#160; &#160; 63,209,845 Kevan&#160;Parekh Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &#160; 2025 &#160; 891,519 &#160; 18,433,135 &#160; 3,120,317 &#160; 22,338 (4)(5) &#160; &#160; 22,467,309 Kate&#160;Adams Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary &#160; 2025 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,009,766 &#160; 4,000,000 &#160; 22,482 (4)(6) &#160; &#160; 27,032,248 &#160; 2024 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,157,075 &#160; 4,000,000 &#160; 22,182 &#160; &#160; 27,179,257 &#160; 2023 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,323,641 &#160; 3,571,150 &#160; 46,914 &#160; &#160; 26,941,705 Sabih Khan Senior Vice President, Chief Operating Officer &#160; 2025 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,009,766 &#160; 4,000,000 &#160; 21,905 (4)(7) &#160; &#160; 27,031,671 Luca Maestri Former Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &#160; 2025 &#160; 819,231 &#160; 13,003,031 &#160; 1,638,462 &#160; 22,204 (4)(8) &#160; &#160; 15,482,928 &#160; 2024 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,157,075 &#160; 4,000,000 &#160; 22,182 &#160; &#160; 27,179,257 &#160; 2023 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,323,641 &#160; 3,571,150 &#160; 41,092 &#160; &#160; 26,935,883 Deirdre O&#8217;Brien Senior Vice President, Retail + People &#160; 2025 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,009,766 &#160; 4,000,000 &#160; 37,867 (4)(9) &#160; &#160; 27,047,633 &#160; 2024 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,157,075 &#160; 4,000,000 &#160; 22,182 &#160; &#160; 27,179,257 &#160; 2023 &#160; 1,000,000 &#160; 22,323,641 &#160; 3,571,150 &#160; 42,219 &#160; &#160; 26,937,010 (1) The target grant value of Mr. Cook&#8217;s long-term equity award was $50 million for 2025 and 2024, and $40 million for 2023. The target grant value of the long-term equity awards for Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan, and Ms. O&#8217;Brien was $20 million for each of 2025, 2024, and 2023. The target grant value of Mr. Parekh&#8217;s long-term equity awards was $16.75 million and the target grant value of Mr. Maestri&#8217;s long-term equity awards was $12.5 million for 2025. This column shows the grant date fair value for accounting purposes of the long-term equity awards granted to our named executive officers. The grant date fair value for time-based RSUs is measured in accordance with FASB ASC 718 and based on the closing price of Apple&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for performance-based RSUs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo model for each award on the date of grant, as determined under FASB ASC 718, based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The grant date fair value for each award may differ based on the applicable data, assumptions, and estimates used in the model. See footnote 1 to the table entitled &#8220;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&#8212;2025.&#8221; (2) As described under &#8220;Executive Compensation&#8212;Compensation Discussion and Analysis,&#8221; the named executive officers&#8217; Cash Incentive Plan awards are based on the performance of Apple relative to predetermined financial goals for the year. The threshold, target, and maximum payout amounts for each named executive officer&#8217;s Cash Incentive Plan payout opportunity for 2025 are shown in the table entitled &#8220;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&#8212;2025.&#8221; In 2025, Apple&#8217;s performance exceeded the maximum performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a maximum payout for each named executive officer. &#160; 52 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; (3) This amount represents: (i) Apple&#8217;s contributions to Mr. Cook&#8217;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $21,000; (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $2,964; (iii) vacation cash-out in the amount of $57,692; (iv) security expenses in the amount of $887,870 which represents the incremental cost to Apple for personal security services provided to Mr. Cook as determined by allocating both direct costs and a percentage of fixed costs incurred by Apple and used to provide such personal security services; and (v) personal air travel expenses in the amount of $789,991, which represent the incremental cost to Apple for Mr. Cook&#8217;s personal use of private aircraft based on hourly flight charges and other variable costs incurred by Apple for such use, including variable fuel charges, departure fees, and landing fees. For security and efficiency reasons, the Board requires Mr. Cook to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel.

Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan, as adjusted for applicable earnings gains and losses and fees, are credited to an account in the participant&#8217;s name and remain fully vested at all times. Participants may select at any time from a diversified menu of notional investment options that generally mirror the investment options of Apple&#8217;s 401(k) plan, and the value of their Deferred Compensation Plan account balance may increase or decrease based on the performance of their selected investment options. In 2025, annual returns on the investment options available for the Deferred Compensation Plan generally ranged from -0.52% to 23.20%. &#160; Deferred Compensation Plan participants may elect to receive distributions of their deferred amounts either upon separation from service or as of a specified in-service distribution date. Distributions will be made in a lump sum payment unless the participant elects installment payments over a period between two and 10&#160;years. A Deferred Compensation Plan participant also may request to receive a hardship distribution on account of an eligible unforeseeable emergency. If a Deferred Compensation Plan participant dies before receiving a complete distribution of their account, the remaining account will be paid to their beneficiaries in a lump sum by December&#160;31 of the year following the participant&#8217;s death. &#160; Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control &#160; We do not have any cash severance arrangements with our named executive officers and none of our named executive officers&#8217; equity awards outstanding as of 2025 fiscal year-end provide for acceleration or a right to receive shares in connection with a change of control or termination of employment for reasons other than death, disability, and, for Mr. Cook, retirement.

The pro-rata vesting is determined based on Mr. Cook&#8217;s period of employment during the vesting period. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook&#8217;s time-based RSUs and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such RSUs is not accelerated upon disability or retirement and will continue to be delivered on the originally scheduled vesting dates. If Mr. Cook terminates employment due to retirement before the first anniversary of the grant date of an outstanding time-based award, he will not have a right to any unvested time-based RSUs under that award. &#160; Mr. Cook&#8217;s outstanding performance-based RSUs provide for a continued right to receive shares that are earned based upon full or partial attainment of the award&#8217;s performance conditions upon a termination of employment due to death, disability, or retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date.

Any changes to the time-based RSU and performance-based RSU grant date fair values (for 2025 grants) and from prior year-end values (for 2021-2024 grants) are based on an updated stock price valuation on the measurement dates and for the performance-based RSUs, include updated input variables for the Monte-Carlo model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance objectives established for the applicable award.

For 2025, the other NEOs were Kevan Parekh , Kate Adams , Sabih Khan , Luca Maestri , and Deirdre O&#8217;Brien . (4) Apple&#8217;s TSR in column (f) was determined based on the value of an initial fixed investment of $100, as of September 26, 2020, including the reinvestment of any dividends. (5) The peer group used to calculate Peer Group TSR in column (g) is our 2025 primary peer group as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. TSR is based on the value of an initial fixed investment of $100 as of September 26, 2020 and is weighted for the market capitalization of each peer company in each applicable year. If the primary peer group from the 2025 Proxy Statement were used, the Peer Group TSR would be $139.22, $97.30, $131.99, $198.69, and $266.58 for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. (6) In addition to Relative TSR and Operating Income, Net Sales in column (i) represents the most important financial performance measure used to link Compensation Actually Paid to Company performance (the &#8220;Company Selected Measure&#8221; as defined in the Pay Versus Performance rules). &#160; 60 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and our Total Shareholder Return &#160; Long-term equity incentives represent a vast majority of our named executive officers&#8217; total target compensation and our stock price performance, measured by TSR, is the key driver of Compensation Actually Paid. We also use Relative TSR as the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs. Over 2025, Apple&#8217;s TSR on an absolute basis was 12.66%, while the TSR of our primary peer group was 35.48%. Apple&#8217;s Relative TSR (the peer group for performance-based RSUs) was strong, resulting in above-target payout for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in 2025. Further, the outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2024 and 2025) continue to trend towards target or above-target payouts due to strong TSR relative to the members of the S&amp;P 500. Compensation Actually Paid to our named executive officers and TSR are tightly linked. &#160; Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income &#160; Net Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability and, for Apple, can contribute to changes in our stock price, which, in turn, drives Compensation Actually Paid. There is no direct correlation between Net Income and Compensation Actually Paid from 2021 to 2025 as we do not use Net Income as a financial measure in our executive compensation program. Operating Income and Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan. &#160; Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales &#160; Net Sales is the financial measure, in addition to Operating Income, that the People and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan. Net Sales and Operating Income are equally the most important financial metrics in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Similar to Operating Income, Net Sales were consistently strong from 2021 to 2025, and this sustained performance led to above target or maximum bonus payouts in each of 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, which increased Compensation Actually Paid to our named executive officers. &#160; Other Relevant Financial Performance Measures &#160; For&#160;2025, the following list represented the most important financial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance: &#160; Net Sales &#160; Operating Income &#160; Relative TSR &#160; &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 61 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; CEO Pay Ratio&#8212;2025 &#160; We offer a wide range of benefits to our global employee population, and we are committed to paying our employees competitively and equitably based on their role. &#160; We identified a new median employee for 2025. We determined our median compensated employee by using base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2025 as our consistently applied compensation measure. We applied this measure to our global employee population as of September 27, 2025, the last day of our 2025 fiscal year, and annualized base salaries for permanent full-time and part-time employees who did not work the full year. &#160; We calculated the median compensated employee&#8217;s 2025 annual total compensation using the same methodology that is used to calculate our CEO&#8217;s annual total compensation in the table entitled &#8220;Summary Compensation Table&#8211;2025, 2024, and 2023.&#8221; The 2025 annual total compensation of our CEO was $74,294,811, the 2025 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $139,483, and the ratio of these amounts is 533 to 1. The compensation included in the pay ratio reflects a reasonable estimate consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology we described above. Because SEC rules for identifying a median compensated employee allow companies to apply certain exclusions, include estimates, and adopt different methodologies that reflect their employee population and compensation practices, the ratio above may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other companies. &#160; 62 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Management Proposals &#160; Proposal No. 1&#160;-&#160; Election of Directors &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 64 Proposal No. 2&#160;-&#160; Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm &#160; 65 Proposal No. 3&#160;-&#160; Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation &#160; 67 Proposal No. 4&#160;-&#160; Approval of the Apple Inc.

The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm annually. In making the determination to re-appoint Ernst&#160;&amp; Young for&#160;2026, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors, the independence and performance of Ernst&#160;&amp; Young, and the quality and candor of Ernst&#160;&amp;&#160;Young&#8217;s communications with the Audit Committee and management. Ernst&#160;&amp; Young has served as Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm since 2009. &#160; At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst&#160;&amp; Young as Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for&#160;2026. Although ratification of the Audit Committee&#8217;s appointment of Ernst&#160;&amp; Young is not required, we value the opinions of our shareholders and believe that shareholder ratification of the appointment is a good corporate governance practice. In the event of a negative vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Representatives of Ernst&#160;&amp; Young are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to questions. &#160; Fees Paid to Auditors &#160; The following table shows the fees billed by Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended&#160;September 27, 2025, and&#160;September 28, 2024&#160;(in thousands). &#160; Ernst&#160;&amp; Young &#160; 2025 ($) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2024 ($) Audit Fees (1) &#160; 24,703 &#160; 22,381 Audit-Related Fees (2) &#160; 2,274 &#160; 2,418 Tax Fees (3) &#160; 4,533 &#160; 3,435 All Other Fees (4) &#160; 2,767 &#160; 2,037 Total &#160; 34,277 &#160; 30,271 (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audits of Apple&#8217;s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings.

This policy mandates that the Audit Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services expected to be performed each year by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for other permissible non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit Committee. In accordance with this policy, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm in&#160;2025. &#160; &#160; &#160; The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal&#160;No.&#160;2 &#160; Vote Required Approval of Proposal No.&#160;2 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&#160;a&#160;majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&#160;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 66 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Proposal No. 3 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation &#160; In accordance with the requirements of Section&#160;14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, our shareholders have the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC&#8217;s compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the executive compensation tables.&#160; &#160; Motivating and retaining an exceptional leadership team is a key factor in enabling Apple&#8217;s long-term success. Our executive compensation program is designed to retain strong, values-driven leaders. We have clear guiding principles and sound compensation policies and practices that align the pay of our named executive officers with the Company&#8217;s financial performance and shareholder returns, taking into consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple&#8217;s business. The compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2025 reflects their contributions to Apple&#8217;s success and continues to demonstrate alignment with Apple&#8217;s strong financial results and the interests of our shareholders. The vast majority of our named executive officers&#8217; compensation is at-risk and delivered through short-term cash incentives and long-term equity awards. We encourage shareholders to read the section entitled &#8220;Compensation Discussion and Analysis,&#8221; beginning on&#160;page&#160;38, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and the People and Compensation Committee&#8217;s decision-making process with respect to our executive compensation program. &#160; 92% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal at the 2025 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. This result reflects the positive shareholder response to the overall structure of our executive compensation program.&#160; &#160; Shareholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: &#160; RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC&#8217;s executive compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the executive compensation tables, is hereby approved. &#160; As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on Apple, the Board, or the People and Compensation Committee. However, the People and Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding named executive officers. &#160; We expect the next advisory Say on Pay vote will occur at the 2027 annual meeting of shareholders. &#160; &#160; &#160; The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal&#160;No.&#160;3 &#160; Vote Required Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 67 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Proposal No. 4 Approval of the Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, as Amended and Restated &#160; At the Annual Meeting, shareholders are being asked to approve the Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the &#8220;Director Plan&#8221;), which was approved by the Board on November 4, 2025, subject to shareholder approval. The material features of the Director Plan are summarized below. The Director Plan is included in its entirety as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. &#160; The Director Plan was last approved by shareholders at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. We are asking shareholders to approve the amendment to the Director Plan to extend the term to February 23, 2036, as the Director Plan is currently set to expire on November 13, 2027.&#160; &#160; The Director Plan is the only active equity incentive plan for Non-Employee Directors. As of September 27, 2025, the last day of our 2025 fiscal year, unvested full-value awards covering 8,643 shares remained outstanding under the Director Plan. &#160; The shares subject to the Director Plan, as set out in this proposal, are restated to reflect our 4-for-1 stock split on August 28, 2020. We are not requesting that shareholders approve an increase in the maximum number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the Director Plan. Based on a review of our historical grant practices, we estimate that the shares currently reserved for grant under the Director Plan should meet Apple&#8217;s equity grant needs to its Non-Employee Directors for approximately 10 years. The shares reserved may, however, last for more or less than 10 years depending on currently unknown factors, such as the number of grant recipients, future grant practices, and Apple&#8217;s stock price. &#160; Description of Non-Employee Director Stock Plan &#160; The following is a summary of the principal features of the Director Plan. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the Director Plan. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Director Plan, which is included in its entirety as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. &#160; Purpose The purposes of the Director Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased common stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals awards in respect of Apple shares. &#160; Eligibility Only directors who are not employees of Apple or any of its subsidiaries may participate in the Director Plan. All seven of Apple&#8217;s Non-Employee Directors currently participate in the Director Plan. &#160; Shares Reserve Authorized and unissued shares of Apple&#8217;s common stock will be issued under the Director Plan. &#160; Maximum Share Reserve. A cumulative total of 44,800,000 shares of Apple&#8217;s common stock may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the Director Plan. As of September 27, 2025, 4,092,836 shares remained available for future award grants under the Director Plan and 8,643 shares were subject to awards then outstanding under the Director Plan. &#160; 68 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Other Share Counting Rules. Shares issued pursuant to restricted stock unit awards shall count against the share limit as two shares for every one share issued in connection with the award. Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of options shall count against the share limit as one share for every one share to which such exercise relates. If awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the share limit.&#160;If awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the shares underlying such awards shall again become available for awards under the Director Plan, provided that any one share subject to a restricted stock unit award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two shares when determining the number of shares that shall again become available for awards under the Director Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a director or withheld by Apple to pay the exercise price of an option granted under the plan, as well as any shares exchanged or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award, will not be available for subsequent awards under the Director Plan. &#160; Limit on Compensation In no event shall the compensation payable by the Company to a Non-Employee Director for services performed as a Non-Employee Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1.5 million in the aggregate in any fiscal year. &#160; Administration The Administrator of the Plan is the Board. The Board has full authority to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Director Plan in its sole discretion. The Board may delegate ministerial, non-discretionary functions to individuals who are officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to third parties. &#160; Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units may be granted under the Director Plan. A restricted stock unit or &#8220;RSU&#8221; is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent of one share, subject to the terms and conditions of the award, and represents an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. Unless earlier forfeited under the terms of the Director Plan, granted restricted stock units generally settle on or as soon as administratively practical after vesting. Restricted stock units granted under the Director Plan do not carry any shareholder rights, including voting or dividend rights, but do have dividend equivalent rights, which are credited to a Non-Employee Director and subject to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the underlying restricted stock units, except they are paid in cash. &#160; The Director Plan provides that each Non-Employee Director serving on the Board immediately following Apple&#8217;s annual meeting of shareholders each year automatically receives a grant of RSUs on the date of the annual meeting (each, an &#8220;Annual Director Award&#8221;). The number of RSUs subject to each Annual Director Award is determined by dividing $310,000 (or such other amount, as determined by the Board prior to the date of such annual meeting) by the per-share fair market value of Apple&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant, rounded to the nearest whole share. All Annual Director Awards are scheduled to vest on the February 1 that occurs in the year following the year in which the award is granted. &#160; A Non-Employee Director who is newly elected or appointed to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders generally also would receive a grant of RSUs upon his or her election or appointment (each, an &#8220;Initial Director Award&#8221;), except that a Non-Employee Director who either (i) joined the Board after February 1 of a particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year or (ii) was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to becoming a Non-Employee Director, would not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the grant date value of the award is pro-rated based on the portion of the year that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards vest on the vesting date established for the Annual Director Awards made at the last annual meeting prior to the date on which the Non-Employee Director joined the Board. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 69 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Stock Options The Director Plan permits the grant of stock options if the Board determines that the grant of stock options is in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. If stock options are granted, the options would be required to have a per share exercise price not less than the fair market value of a share of Apple&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant, would be immediately vested unless otherwise specified at the time of grant, and would expire ten years from the date of grant. There are currently no stock options outstanding under the Director Plan. &#160; Restrictions on Transfer Except as described below, awards under the Director Plan generally are not transferable by the recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and stock options are generally exercisable, during the recipient&#8217;s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director. The Board has discretion, however, to allow for an award to be transferred to a Non-Employee Director&#8217;s family members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.&#160; &#160; No Repricing No adjustment may be made to the plan or any stock option under the Director Plan (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange, or other means) that would constitute a repricing of the per-share exercise price of the option except for an adjustment to reflect a stock split or similar event provided in the Director Plan or any repricing that might be approved by shareholders. &#160; Termination of Service If a Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than death, that director&#8217;s outstanding and unvested awards generally would terminate on the date the director ceased to be a member of the Board. Upon the death of a Non-Employee Director, all unvested awards would become fully vested. Any options that are exercisable at the time of the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s termination other than for death may be exercised at any time within 90 days after the date of such termination, provided that if the termination is as a result of such Non-Employee Director&#8217;s death, the options may be exercised by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three years after the date of such death. At the end of the applicable 90-day or three-year period, any unexercised options shall expire. &#160; Adjustments; Corporate Transactions; Change of Control The share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the Director Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise prices of awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events. Upon a change of control, the Director Plan provides for vesting of outstanding awards, pro-rated based on the portion of the vesting period that has elapsed as of the date of the change of control. &#160; Amendment and Termination The Board has the authority to amend or terminate the Director Plan at any time, including the authority to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants to Non-Employee Directors subject to the compensation limit described above, the methodology for determining the number of shares of Apple&#8217;s common stock subject to these grants, and the vesting and other terms and conditions of these grants without shareholder approval. However, the Board may not increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Director Plan without shareholder approval. &#160; Term The amended and restated Director Plan will become effective upon shareholder approval. If shareholders approve this proposal, unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Director Plan will expire on February 23, 2036. No further awards would be granted under the Director Plan after that date. &#160; 70 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Federal Income Tax Consequences &#160; The following is a brief summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to awards granted under the Director Plan based on the federal income tax laws in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters relevant to a particular participant based on their specific circumstances. The summary expressly does not discuss the income tax laws of any state, municipality, or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction, or the gift, estate, excise (including the rules applicable to deferred compensation under Section&#160;409A of the Internal Revenue Code), or other tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax law. The following is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties. Because individual circumstances may vary, we advise all participants to consult their own tax advisor concerning the tax implications of awards granted under the Director Plan. &#160; A recipient of a stock option will not have taxable income upon the grant of the stock option. A participant will recognize ordinary income upon exercise of a stock option in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the exercise price on the date of exercise. Any gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares generally will be a capital gain or loss.&#160; &#160; A participant is not deemed to receive any taxable income at the time an award of restricted stock unit is granted. When vested RSUs (and dividend equivalent rights, if any) are settled and distributed, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of shares received less the amount paid for such restricted stock units, if any. &#160; Apple will be allowed a tax deduction for the amount recognized as ordinary income by a Non-Employee Director upon vesting or exercise. &#160; Future Plan Benefits &#160; None of Apple&#8217;s employees, including its executive officers and the named executive officers, are eligible to participate in the Director Plan. Outstanding RSU awards under the Director Plan are reported on page 32 in the table entitled &#8220;Director Compensation&#8212;2025.&#8221; As of the date of this Proxy Statement, no new grants were made to our current Non-Employee Directors, any nominee for the Board for the Annual Meeting, or any associate of any of our directors or executive officers. On the date of the Annual Meeting, Non-Employee Directors duly elected to the Board will be granted an Annual Director Award as described in the &#8220;Restricted Stock Units&#8221; section on page 69 of this Proposal.

Our teams around the world work to infuse Apple&#8217;s deeply held values into everything we make. Apple engages with stakeholders as part of our commitment to advance meaningful change and find novel solutions to pressing challenges. We welcome dialogue, including regarding the issues presented in the proposal below, and contacted the proponent to discuss their concerns and provide information about Apple&#8217;s policies and practices. Apple continues to build effective programs designed to tackle challenges and to communicate our progress through transparent reporting. &#160; The proposal below was submitted by a shareholder under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. This proposal, and the supporting statement, is included as submitted to us by the proponent. Apple&#8217;s opposition statement, as well as the Board&#8217;s voting recommendation, immediately follow the shareholder proposal. &#160; Proposal &#160; Board Voting Recommendation 5 &#160; China Entanglement Audit &#9679;&#160;&#160;The requested report is unnecessary given we already provide extensive information on our international operations. &#9679;&#160;&#160;The proposal is highly prescriptive and attempts to inappropriately restrict Apple&#8217;s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations and business strategies. &#160; AGAINST &#160; In October 2025, the Company submitted no-action requests to the Staff of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Corporation Finance asking the Staff to concur with the Company&#8217;s view that certain proposals submitted to the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement could be properly excluded under SEC Rule 14a-8. The Staff subsequently announced that they would not respond to most requests for exclusion of shareholder proposals under SEC Rule 14a-8. &#160; Following that announcement, and based on the Company&#8217;s review of the provisions of Rule 14a-8, prior Staff guidance on the application of Rule 14a-8, and judicial decisions, we determined that it was appropriate to exclude a shareholder proposal because the proponent failed to provide required documentation to show that they had continuously owned the requisite amount of Company securities consistent with SEC Rule 14a-8 and related Staff interpretations. Prior to submitting our notice of exclusion to the Staff and the proponent, we reached out again to the shareholder to explain our reason for exclusion and to offer to discuss their proposal. &#160; Identification of Proponents &#160; Proposal No. 5 was submitted for the Annual Meeting by a shareholder who has represented to Apple that they have continuously been the beneficial owner of a sufficient amount of the Company&#8217;s securities for a sufficient time period as required by Rule 14a-8. We will promptly provide you with the address and, to our knowledge, the number of voting securities held by the proponent of the shareholder proposal upon receiving a written or oral request directed to Apple&#8217;s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA, or by phone at: (408) 974-3123. &#160; Vote Required &#160; Approval of Proposal No. 5 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &#160; 74 2026 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Proposal No. 5 Shareholder Proposal &#160; Apple has been advised that the National Center for Public Policy Research intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. &#160; China Entanglement Audit &#160; Whereas: &#160; &#9679; With escalating U.S.&#8211;China trade tensions, Apple could face steep tariff increases. Analysts warn tariffs on Chinese imports could hit as high as 145%, severely inflating production costs. One article projects this could add $10 billion annually to iPhone expenses. (1) &#9679; While Apple is apparently shifting some production to India and Vietnam, these regions still depend heavily on Chinese parts, and manufacturing costs are 5&#8211;10% higher. (2) &#9679; China may restrict support from Chinese engineers or suppliers to Apple&#8217;s new operations in India&#8212;potentially delaying diversification plans. (3) &#9679; Greater China &#8212; encompassing Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan &#8212; accounted for nearly 20% of Apple&#8217;s revenues&#8212;about $74 billion annually. A regional conflict (e.g., over Taiwan) could abruptly eliminate this, much like Russia-related disruptions did for others. (4) &#9679; The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act further complicates matters. Chinese suppliers linked to Xinjiang&#8217;s labor practices face U.S. bans, risking supply chain disruptions. Meanwhile, China&#8217;s control over rare earth minerals&#8212;essential for semiconductors and sensors&#8212;gives it leverage to weaponize shortages. (5) &#9679; Apple has previously been the target of Chinese Espionage actions; the company&#8217;s proprietary data pertaining to its autonomous vehicles program was stolen in 2018 and 2019. (6) Since then, Chinese firms have become a global leader in autonomous vehicles, (7) potentially off the back of Apple&#8217;s investment. &#9679; &#8220;As Patrick McGee makes devastatingly clear in &#8230; Apple in China , the American company&#8217;s decision &#8230; to manufacture about 90 percent of its products in China has created an existential vulnerability not just for Apple, but for the United States&#8212;nurturing the conditions for Chinese technology to outpace American innovation.&#8221; (8) &#9679; Apple&#8217;s disclosures regarding the foregoing issues have fallen short of adequately informing shareholders. (9) &#9679; Insufficient disclosures can expose Apple to additional litigation risk.

The financial exposure under high-tariff scenarios and mitigation strategies. 2. The dollar value of revenues and profits at risk from regulatory or geopolitical actions in China. 3. The danger and risks associated with intellectual property theft from Chinese firms. 4. The timeline and cost implications of supply chain diversification away from China. &#160; A transparent, scenario-based analysis will help shareholders assess whether current strategies are sufficient to protect Apple&#8217;s profitability and long-term growth. Without such disclosure, investors cannot adequately evaluate the Company&#8217;s resilience in the face of mounting geopolitical and economic risks. &#160; For these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal. &#160; 76 2026 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Apple&#8217;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&#160;5 &#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; AGAINST &#160;&#160;&#160; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 5 because: &#160; Proposal No. 5 &#160; &#9679; the requested report is unnecessary given we already provide extensive information on our international operations; and &#9679; the proposal is highly prescriptive and attempts to inappropriately restrict Apple&#8217;s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations and business strategies. &#160; Apple products are designed in California and made all over the world, with manufacturing, sales, and operations extending to over 50 countries and regions. We work with millions of people and thousands of innovative businesses to build the best products and services and to effectively serve our customers around the globe. &#160; The requested report is unnecessary given we already provide extensive information on our international operations. As a public company with international operations in over 50 countries and regions, we already regularly update our shareholders as to the nature and extent of our global presence and any material risks that we face in our business. For example, in our various periodic reports that are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we discuss our results of operations by segment, including our Greater China segment, and provide disclosures covering material risks to our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. Such disclosures cover, among other things, risks from our international customer base and operations, international trade restrictions and tariffs, potential exposures due to the geographic concentration of certain of our operations, challenges in diversifying, and threats to our competitive position if we fail to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. &#160; We also voluntarily provide additional information relating to our global supply chain and operations. For example, we have announced significant investments in our operations in the United States, such as the August 2025 announcement bringing our total U.S. investment to $600 billion over the next four years and announcing the launch of our new American Manufacturing Program. (1) We also publish annually our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain progress report (2) where we discuss in detail our programs and expectations across our global supply chain. Given our extensive disclosures relating to our worldwide operations, including potential risks, as well as updates on recent investments, we believe the requested report would not provide any additional material information to shareholders. &#160; The proposal is highly prescriptive and attempts to inappropriately restrict Apple&#8217;s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations and business strategies. Apple operates and sells products and services in numerous countries around the world to best serve its worldwide customer base. Apple&#8217;s decisions regarding where to locate operations involve complex considerations and analysis of many factors, such as understanding geopolitical conditions, trade policies, regulatory environments, manufacturing capabilities, consumer preferences, operational considerations, and the ability to serve Apple&#8217;s global customer base, along with financial, legal, tax, and reputational factors. Although the requested report presents its inquiry as neutral fact-finding, we believe the level of detail and direction in the proposal&#8217;s supporting statement suggests a preferred method of action and would inappropriately infringe on Apple&#8217;s ability to manage this complex strategic work by attempting to dictate Apple&#8217;s decisions with respect to our operations and global footprint. &#160; Our Board and management maintain active oversight of our global operations. The Board oversees this important work, and reviews and discusses with management updates regarding Apple&#8217;s international operations and supply chain management. &#160; Apple&#8217;s Board is also responsible for the oversight of significant risks affecting our business and Apple&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Program. The Board actively exercises this oversight through regular reviews and discussion with Apple management handling key risks, and is supported by the Audit and Finance Committee, which has the primary responsibility for assisting the full Board with its risk oversight duties. &#160; Apple&#8217;s Enterprise Risk Management Program is designed to identify, assess, and monitor our significant business risks, including risks related to our international operations and supply chain. The program is supported by a Risk Oversight Committee, consisting of our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Head of Business Assurance, and other senior business leaders, that assists the Audit and Finance Committee with its general responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management. Through these robust risk management and reporting systems, Apple is able to continually evaluate and seek to mitigate the risks confronting our business. &#160; (1) apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-increases-us-commitment-to-600-billion-usd-announces-ambitious-program/ (2) supplychainreports.apple &#160; 2026 Proxy Statement 77 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Other Matters &#160; Apple knows of no other matters to be submitted to shareholders at the Annual Meeting, other than the proposals identified in this Proxy Statement.

Each member is an independent director under Nasdaq and SEC rules and meets the standards for committee independence as set forth in Apple&#8217;s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Audit and Finance Committee has the duties and powers described in its written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the charter is available on Apple&#8217;s website at&#160; investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board&#8217;s oversight and monitoring of: &#160; &#9679;&#160;&#160;Apple&#8217;s financial statements and other financial information provided by Apple to its shareholders and&#160;others; &#9679;&#160;&#160;compliance with legal, regulatory, and public disclosure requirements; &#160; &#9679;&#160;&#160;the independent auditors, including&#160;their qualifications and independence; &#9679;&#160;&#160;Apple&#8217;s system of internal controls, including the internal audit function; &#160; &#9679;&#160;&#160;treasury and finance matters; &#9679;&#160;&#160;enterprise risk management, privacy, and data security; and &#9679;&#160;&#160;the auditing, accounting, and financial reporting process generally. &#160; The Audit and Finance Committee does not itself prepare financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of Apple&#8217;s financial statements. &#160; The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work performed by Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee carefully reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services. &#160; Ernst&#160;&amp; Young has served as Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm since 2009 and rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the oversight of the selection of the lead engagement partner. &#160; Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit and Finance Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit and Finance Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm for non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit and Finance Committee. &#160; The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended&#160;September 27, 2025,&#160;with Apple&#8217;s management and Ernst &amp; Young. The Audit and Finance Committee has also discussed with Ernst&#160;&amp; Young the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) and the SEC. &#160; The Audit and Finance Committee has also received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst&#160;&amp; Young required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst &amp; Young&#8217;s communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst&#160;&amp; Young its independence. &#160; Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements referred to above be included in Apple&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2025,&#160;for filing with the SEC. &#160; Members of the Audit and Finance Committee &#160; Ron Sugar (Chair) Wanda Austin Monica Lozano Sue Wagner &#160; 80 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management &#160; The following table shows information as of January 2, 2026 (the &#8220;Table Date&#8221;), unless otherwise indicated, regarding the beneficial ownership of Apple&#8217;s common stock by: (i) each person known to Apple to beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Apple&#8217;s common stock based solely on Apple&#8217;s review of filings with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act; (ii) each director and nominee; (iii) each named executive officer listed in the table entitled &#8220;Summary Compensation Table&#8212; 2025, 2024, and 2023&#8221; under the section entitled &#8220;Executive Compensation&#8221;; and (iv) all current directors and executive officers as a group.

Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, as amended and restated (Proposal No. 4); and &#9679; Shareholder proposal (Proposal No. 5).&#160; &#160; If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a &#8220;broker non-vote.&#8221; Therefore, broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposal No.&#160;1 and Proposals No.&#160;3 through No.&#160;5. &#160; 88 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Vote Required to Approve a Proposal &#160; With respect to the election of directors (Proposal No.&#160;1), Apple&#8217;s bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, the affirmative vote of (i)&#160;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii)&#160;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum is required to elect a director. An &#8220;uncontested election of directors&#8221; means an election of directors in which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election. &#160; Approval of Proposals No.&#160;2 through No.&#160;5 requires, in each case, the affirmative vote of (i)&#160;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii)&#160;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &#160; Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions &#160; Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Only &#8220;FOR&#8221; and &#8220;AGAINST&#8221; votes are counted for purposes of determining the votes received in connection with each proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on determining whether the affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting. &#160; In addition, for each proposal, the affirmative vote equal to a majority of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum is also required for approval. Therefore, broker non-votes and abstentions could prevent the election of a director or the approval of a proposal because they do not count as affirmative votes. &#160; Confidentiality of Votes &#160; Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Apple will not disclose the proxy instructions or ballots of individual shareholders, except: &#160; &#9679; To allow for the tabulation and certification of votes; &#9679; To facilitate a successful proxy solicitation; &#9679; To assert claims for Apple; &#9679; To defend claims against Apple; and &#9679; As necessary to meet applicable legal requirements. &#160; If you write comments on your proxy card or ballot, the proxy card or ballot may be forwarded to Apple&#8217;s management and the Board to review your comments. &#160; Tabulation and Reporting of Voting Results &#160; Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election after the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. Apple will publish the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting. &#160; Director Nominations and Other Matters for the 2027 Annual Meeting of Shareholders &#160; Proposals and director nominations must be sent either by mail to Apple&#8217;s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA, or by email to&#160; shareholderproposal@apple.com . &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement 89 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; Matters for Inclusion in the Proxy Materials for the 2027 Annual Meeting of Shareholders &#160; Matters for inclusion in the proxy materials for the&#160;2027&#160;annual meeting of shareholders, other than nominations of directors, must be received on or before the close of business on September 10, 2026.

Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (c) LIMIT ON COMPENSATION .

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS . Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, each Non-Employee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator: &#160; &#160; (a) ANNUAL GRANTS . On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board prior to the date of such Annual Meeting and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an &#8220; Annual RSU Award &#8221;). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (b) INITIAL GRANTS . Each Non-Employee Director who first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the dollar amount applied under Section 4(a) with respect to Awards granted at the immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B) the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an &#8220; Initial RSU Award &#8221;); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement A-3 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; &#160; (c) VESTING; TERMINATION OF SERVICE . Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted. Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award. If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s death, the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units. If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s death. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (d) SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS . On or as soon as administratively practical following the applicable Vesting Date (and in all events not later than two and one-half months after the applicable Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units that vested on the applicable Vesting Date. Upon settlement of any Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the foregoing provision of this Section 4(d) and settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (e) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS .

Except for any Dividend Equivalent Rights awarded pursuant to Section 4(f) or as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (f) DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS . As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a &#8220; Dividend Equivalent Right &#8221;). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c). &#160; A-4 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; 5.

Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (d) TERM OF OPTIONS . &#160; &#160; i.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator. &#160; 2026&#160;Proxy&#160;Statement A-5 Table of Contents Summary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information &#160; &#160; iii. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS . A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof. &#160; &#160; (f) ISSUANCE OF SHARES . Subject to the foregoing conditions, as soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such Beneficiary), the appropriate number of Shares to be issued in connection with such exercise. Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such other manner that the Administrator shall specify from time to time.

An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director&#8217;s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous sentence. No assignment or transfer of an Award, or of the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect. &#160; &#160; 7.
