Profitability $8.9B GAAP operating income in 2023; $2.1B in Q4 $15.0B GAAP net income in 2023; $7.9B in Q4 $10.9B non-GAAP net income 1 in 2023; $2.5B in Q4 One-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.9B recorded in Q4 for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets In 2023, we delivered over 1.2 million Model Ys, making it the best -selling vehicle, of any kind, globally. For a long time, many doubted the viability of EVs. Today, the best-selling vehicle on the planet is an EV. Free cash flow remained strong in 2023 at $4.4B, even as we focused on future growth projects with our highest capital expenditures and R&D expenses in company history. Energy storage deployments reached 14.7 GWh in 2023, more than double compared to the previous year, while Energy Generation and Storage business profits nearly quadrupled in 2023. Gross profit of our Services & Other business increased from a ~$500M loss in 2019 to a ~$500M profit in 2023. Cost of goods sold per vehicle 5 declined sequentially in Q4. Our team remains focused on growing our output, investing in our future growth and finding additional cost efficiencies in 2024. In late December, we started rolling out V12 of FSD Beta 6. Trained on data from a fleet of over a million vehicles, this system uses AI to influence vehicle controls (steering wheel, pedals, indicators, etc.) instead of hard -coding every driving behavior. V12 marks a new era in the path to full autonomy. We are focused on bringing the next generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas. This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.

YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: + growth in vehicle deliveries + growth in other parts of the business + positive FX impact of $0.1B 1 - reduced vehicle average selling price (ASP) YoY (excl. FX impact), including unfavorable impact of mix - lower FSD revenue recognition YoY due to FSD Beta wide release in North America in Q4`22 Profitability Our operating income decreased YoY to $2.1B in Q4, resulting in an 8.2% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items: - reduced vehicle ASP due to pricing and mix - increase in operating expenses partly driven by AI and other R&D projects - lower FSD revenue recognition YoY due to FSD Beta wide release in North America in Q4`22 - cost of Cybertruck production ramp + lower cost per vehicle, including lower raw material costs, logistics costs and IRA credit benefit + growth in vehicle deliveries + gross profit growth in Energy Generation and Storage While it did not impact Operating Income, we did record a one -time non-cash tax benefit of $5.9B in Q4 for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. Cash Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments increased sequentially by $3.0B to $29.1B in Q4, driven by free cash flow of $2.1B and financing activities of $0.9B.

Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM) Source: Tesla estimates based on latest available data from ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM – light- duty vehicles only; TTM = Trailing twelve months9 After our scheduled global factory shutdown in Q3, our global production reached a record annualized run rate of nearly 2.0 million vehicles in Q4. The refreshed Model 3 - with a significantly quieter cabin, ventilated seats, a screen for rear seats, longer range and many other improvements - is now available globally. US: California, Nevada and Texas Before Tesla purchased the Fremont factory, the record output of the previous owner was nearly 430,000 vehicles made in a single year. In 2023, the Tesla Fremont factory produced nearly 560,000 vehicles thanks to our ~20,000 Fremont - based employees. At Gigafactory Texas, we began production of the Cybertruck and delivered the first units to customers. We expect the ramp of Cybertruck to be longer than other models given its manufacturing complexity. China: Shanghai Shanghai resumed normal rate production in Q4, rebounding from the scheduled downtime in Q3. Production of the updated Model 3 ramped to full speed in less than two months. Europe: Berlin -Brandenburg Model Y production in Berlin continued to grow in Q4, achieving both a record weekly production rate and a sequential increase in total production volume for the seventh consecutive quarter. 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% US/Canada Europe China Cost of goods sold per vehicle C O R E T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD Beta (millions) 10 Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware In Q4, we released our latest FSD Beta software (V12) to select Tesla employees, and more recently, to customers. V12 utilizes end -to-end training, enhancing the driving experience. We also introduced the 2 nd generation of the Optimus robot, which uses Tesla-designed actuators and sensors and improved AI capabilities. Both FSD Beta and Optimus are trained with similar technology pillars: real -world data, neural net training and cutting -edge hardware and software. Vehicle and Other Software We delivered the Cybertruck with an all -new user interface and new communication bus, Etherloop, that efficiently moves data while significantly reducing wiring. As part of our holiday update, when parking, Tesla vehicles without ultrasonic sensors display a high-fidelity 3D rendering of the vehicle's surroundings, including nearby barriers, vehicles and painted markings. Wireless Bluetooth headphones can also now be paired with the rear screen when watching shows or playing games. FleetAPI now enables third -party solutions that enhance integration and management of Tesla devices. Battery, Powertrain & Manufacturing Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially to slightly above $36,000. Even as we approach the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup, our team continues to focus on further cost reductions across all points of production, from raw materials to final delivery. $34,000 $35,000 $36,000 $37,000 $38,000 $39,000 $40,000 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 O T H E R H I G H L I G H T S 11 Services & Other gross profit ($M) Energy Storage Energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q4 to 3.2 GWh, for a total deployment of 14.7 GWh in 2023, a 125% increase compared to 2022. While we expect deployments will continue to be volatile on a sequential basis, impacted by logistics and the global distribution of projects at any given time, we expect continued growth on a trailing twelve -month basis going forward. We continue to ramp our 40 GWh Megafactory in Lathrop, CA toward full capacity. Solar Solar deployments declined on a sequential and YoY basis to 41 MW. Downward pressure on solar demand continued into Q4 as interest rates have remained high. Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by lower deployments and seasonal weakness in solar energy generation. Services and Other business The Services and Other business continued to grow alongside our fleet in 2023, achieving record revenue and gross profit generation. The biggest drivers of profit generation in 2023 were part sales, used vehicle sales, merchandise sales and pay - per-use supercharging. As our fleet continues to expand in the coming years, there is an opportunity for fleet -related services to become a more meaningful driver of profit generation.

In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next -generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas. In 2024, the growth rate of deployments and revenue in our Energy Storage business should outpace the Automotive business. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits. Product Cybertruck production and deliveries will ramp throughout this year. In addition, we continue to make progress on our next generation platform.

will provide a live webcast of its fourth quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on January 24, 2024 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery. "Adjusted EBITDA" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. "Free cash flow" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 31
