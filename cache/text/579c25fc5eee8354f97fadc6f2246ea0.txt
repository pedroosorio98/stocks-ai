JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 – $552 billion of capital raised for clients – $35 billion of credit1 provided and capital raised for nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities • Hired more than 5,600 U.S. veterans and service members since the beginning of 2011 New York, July 12, 2013 – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net income of $6.5 billion for the second quarter of 2013, compared with net income of $5.0 billion in the second quarter of 2012. Earnings per share were $1.60, compared with $1.21 in the second quarter of 2012. Revenue1 for the quarter was $26.0 billion, compared with $22.9 billion in the prior year. The Firm's return on tangible common equity1 for the second quarter of 2013 was 17%, compared with 15% in the prior year. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial results: “Our earnings reflected strong performance across our businesses. We maintained our #1 ranking in global Investment Banking fees. Consumer deposits were up 10% compared with the prior year and Credit Card sales volumes were a record $105.2 billion, up 10%. And notably, Asset Management had $25 billion of net long-term client flows, the seventeenth consecutive quarter of positive net long-term client flows. Net charge-offs remain near historical lows in our Credit Card business, have dropped to less than half of what they were a year ago for our Real Estate Portfolios and remained very low in our wholesale portfolios. In light of these trends, we reduced the allowance for loan losses in Consumer & Community Banking in the second quarter by a total of $1.5 billion. Loan growth across the industry continued to be soft, reflecting a cautious stance by consumers, many small businesses and corporations. However, we continue to see broad-based signs that the U.S. economy is improving and we are hopeful that, as jobs are added and confidence builds, the U.S. economy will strengthen over time.” Dimon continued: “This quarter, we exceeded the proposed Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirement – as of the end of the second quarter, our estimated ratio was 118% – and we are committed to achieving a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1 of 9.5% by the end of this year. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio1, reflecting the final rules approved by the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013, was approximately 9.3% at the end of the second quarter, including the reduction of the value of our investment securities that are available for sale because of higher long-term interest rates. ” Dimon added: “While we have put extensive focus on our control agenda, we have continued to serve our clients and communities around the world. During the first six months of the year we raised capital and provided credit2 totaling $1.0 trillion for our clients, from individuals to large multinational corporations. Regarding our control agenda, we have taken some of our best people, given them enormous resources and tasked them with ensuring that our systems, practices, controls and technology meet the highest standards. We are confident that these investments will pay off and we will be a better company for it.” Dimon concluded: “I am proud of this Company and what our employees do every day to serve our clients, customers and communities in over a hundred countries.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Private Equity reported net income of $212 million, compared with net income of $197 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $410 million, same as prior year. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $429 million, compared with a net loss of $2.1 billion in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $648 million, compared with a loss of $3.4 billion in the prior year. The prior- year loss reflected $4.4 billion of principal transactions losses from the synthetic credit portfolio that had been held by CIO, partially offset by securities gains of $1.0 billion. Net revenue in the current quarter included net securities gains of $123 million from sales of available-for-sale investment securities and a modest loss related to the redemption of trust preferred securities. Current-quarter net interest income was a loss of $558 million due to low interest rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. Other Corporate reported a net loss of $335 million, compared with net income of $119 million in the prior year. Noninterest revenue included $545 million in the prior year related to the gain on the recovery of a Bear Stearns-related subordinated loan. The current quarter included approximately $600 million of expense for additional litigation reserves, compared with $335 million of expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year.

See notes on page 12 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $25,211 million, $25,122 million, and $22,180 million for the second quarter of 2013, first quarter of 2013, and second quarter of 2012, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.5 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 31%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $26.0 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 13%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up $3.5 billion, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter revenue included a $355 million gain from DVA on certain structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the widening of the Firm's credit spreads; the prior year included a gain from DVA of $755 million. Net interest income was $10.9 billion, down $472 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates on investment securities yield and on reinvestment opportunities, lower loan yields and portfolio run-off, partially offset by lower long-term debt costs. The provision for credit losses was $47 million, down $167 million from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was a benefit of $29 million, compared with an expense of $171 million in the prior year. The consumer provision reflected a $1.5 billion release of allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting continued home price improvement, favorable delinquency trends and lower estimated losses in mortgage and credit card portfolios. The prior year consumer provision reflected a $2.1 billion reduction in the related allowance for loan losses predominantly related to the mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.5 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.66% and 2.51%, respectively. The decrease in consumer net charge- offs was primarily due to improved delinquency trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $76 million, compared with $43 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $67 million, compared with net charge-offs of $9 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rate of 0.09% and a net charge- off rate of 0.01%, respectively. The Firm's allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 was 2.06%, compared 2.74% in the prior year. The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $10.9 billion at June 30, 2013, down from the prior-quarter level of $11.6 billion and down compared with the prior-year level of $11.4 billion. Noninterest expense was $15.9 billion, up $900 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher compensation expense on higher revenue and higher litigation reserves, partially offset by lower mortgage servicing expense. The current-quarter noninterest expense included $678 million of expense for additional litigation reserves, compared with $323 million of expense for additional litigation reserves in the prior year. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) Basel I Tier 1 common ratio1 was 10.4% at June 30, 2013, including the impact of the final Basel 2.5 rules that became effective on January 1, 2013. Headcount was 254,063, a decrease of 6,335, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion at June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, and June 30, 2012. In Corporate & Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represents common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firm's earnings as a percentage of average TCE. In management's view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as to analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm's use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. d. The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are both non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other financial services companies. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred securities. In July 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve approved the final rule for implementing Basel III in the United States. For further information on Basel I and Basel III, see Regulatory capital on pages 117-119 and 42-45 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, respectively. e. In Consumer & Community Banking, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented include loans held-for-sale. f. Corporate & Investment Bank provides several measures which exclude the impact of debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”) on: net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Consumer & Community Banking deposit rankings are based on the Firm's and peer disclosures for the first quarter of 2013. Accounts include checking accounts and Chase LiquidSM cards. c. Mortgage Banking provision for credit losses is included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense of Mortgage Production. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the first quarter of 2013. e. In Commercial Banking, effective January 1, 2013, whole loan financing agreements, previously reported as other assets, were reclassified as loans. For the three months ended June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, the impact on period-end loans was $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and the impact on average loans was $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, for the same periods, respectively. f. Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of Asset Management against the performance of its respective peers. g. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.
