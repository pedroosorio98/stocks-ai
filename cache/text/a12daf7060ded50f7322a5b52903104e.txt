New Director Appointment Effective June&nbsp;11, 2019, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) appointed Justine F. Page as an independent director of the Company. Ms.&nbsp;Page served as the Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance, Treasurer, and Secretary of Integrated Circuit Systems, Inc., from May 1999 to September 2005 when ICS merged with Integrated Device Technologies, Inc., following which Ms.&nbsp;Page retired. She joined ICS in 1993, holding titles including Director of Finance and Administration and Assistant Treasurer. From June 2008 until April 2017, Ms.&nbsp;Page served on the board of our predecessors, including Avago Technologies and Broadcom Limited, and served as chairperson of its Audit Committee and a member of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Ms. Page&#146;s qualifications to serve on our Board include her career in senior financial management positions with, and on the board of directors of, semiconductor companies, and her education and training as an accounting professional. Ms.&nbsp;Page will participate in the non-employee director compensation arrangements generally applicable to all of the Company&#146;s non-employee directors. Under the terms of those arrangements, as currently in effect, Ms.&nbsp;Page received an initial restricted stock unit award with a value of $183,333 on June&nbsp;11, 2019, her first date of service as a director, which will vest in full on the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the first anniversary of the grant date and (ii)&nbsp;the date on which the Company&#146;s annual meeting of stockholders immediately following the grant date is held, subject to her continuing service on the vesting date. The number of shares subject to this award was determined by dividing the value of the award by the average of the Company&#146;s per share closing market prices, as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, over the 30 calendar days immediately preceding June&nbsp;11, 2019. In addition, Ms.&nbsp;Page will be entitled to receive the annual cash and equity compensation payable to other non-employee directors of the Company. Details regarding the Company&#146;s non-employee director compensation program are set forth in the Company&#146;s Proxy Statement related to its 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February&nbsp;19, 2019.
