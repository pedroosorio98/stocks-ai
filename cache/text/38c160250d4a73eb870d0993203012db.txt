Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 5 Apple Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”). The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 34,630 $ 28,755 Denominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 16,391,724 16,935,119 Effect of dilutive securities 127,567 178,569 Weighted-average diluted shares 16,519,291 17,113,688 Basic earnings per share $ 2.11 $ 1.70 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.10 $ 1.68 Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 6 Note 2 – Revenue Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 iPhone® (1) $ 71,628 $ 65,597 Mac® (1) 10,852 8,675 iPad® (1) 7,248 8,435 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 14,701 12,971 Services (3) 19,516 15,761 Total net sales (4) $ 123,945 $ 111,439 (1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 8 The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of December 25, 2021 (in millions): Due after 1 year through 5 years $ 93,206 Due after 5 years through 10 years 25,183 Due after 10 years 20,294 Total fair value $ 138,683 Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 25, 2021 , the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 21 years. The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): December 25, 2021 September 25, 2021 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 77,009 $ 76,475 Interest rate contracts $ 16,875 $ 16,875 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 176,268 $ 126,918 The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities were not material as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021. The gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income for the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not material in the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 9 The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions): December 25, 2021 September 25, 2021 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ 15,322 $ 15,954 Current and non-current term debt $ (17,444) $ (17,857) The gains and losses on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item adjustments were not material in the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit- financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 45% and 42% of total trade receivables as of December 25, 2021 and September 25, 2021, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54%, 13% and 12%. As of September 25, 2021 , the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.

Note 6 – Shareholders’ Equity Share Repurchase Program As of December 25, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program (the “Program”). During the three months ended December 25, 2021, the Company repurchased 124 million shares of its common stock for $20.4 billion , including 30 million shares initially delivered under accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”) entered into in November 2021, bringing the total utilization under the Program to $274.5 billion as of December 25, 2021 . The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 11 Under the terms of the Company’s ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payment s totaling $6.0 billion . The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume- weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the second quarter of 2022. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity in the period the payments are made.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Available Information The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Quarterly Highlights Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. COVID-19 Update The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock. During the first quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and certain of the Company’s retail stores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. The Company has reopened substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. At times, certain of the Company’s component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar impacts or other disruptions could occur in the future. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 14 The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information. First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Highlights Total net sales increased 11% or $12.5 billion during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by growth in iPhone, Services and Mac.

Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.” The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Change Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 51,496 $ 46,310 11 % Europe 29,749 27,306 9 % Greater China 25,783 21,313 21 % Japan 7,107 8,285 (14) % Rest of Asia Pacific 9,810 8,225 19 % Total net sales $ 123,945 $ 111,439 11 % Americas Americas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of Services, iPhone, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Europe Europe net sales increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of Services, Mac and iPhone. The movement of foreign currencies in Europe relative to the U.S. dollar had a net favorable impact on Europe net sales during the first quarter of 2022. Greater China Greater China net sales increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The strength of the Chinese renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Greater China net sales during the first quarter of 2022. Japan Japan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and iPad, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. The weakness of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on Japan net sales during the first quarter of 2022. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 16 Rest of Asia Pacific Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. Gross Margin Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Gross margin: Products $ 40,120 $ 33,548 Services 14,123 10,780 Total gross margin $ 54,243 $ 44,328 Gross margin percentage: Products 38.4% 35.1% Services 72.4% 68.4% Total gross margin percentage 43.8% 39.8% Products Gross Margin Products gross margin and Products gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Services Gross Margin Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 due primarily to a different Services mix and leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Research and development $ 6,306 $ 5,163 Percentage of total net sales 5% 5% Selling, general and administrative $ 6,449 $ 5,631 Percentage of total net sales 5% 5% Total operating expenses $ 12,755 $ 10,794 Percentage of total net sales 10% 10% Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 17 Research and Development The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services.

Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three months ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Provision for income taxes $ 6,611 $ 4,824 Effective tax rate 16.0% 14.4% Statutory federal income tax rate 21% 21% The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the same quarte r in 2021 due primarily to lower tax benefits from share-based compensation and a change in geographic mix of earnings. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 18 Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 25, 2021 , the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $47.6 billion, with $47.5 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. In addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program (the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of December 25, 2021, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of December 25, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 19 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K. Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 20 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers Share repurchase activity during the three months ended December 25, 2021 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts): Periods Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) September 26, 2021 to October 30, 2021: Open market and privately negotiated purchases 41,416 $ 144.87 41,416 October 31, 2021 to November 27, 2021: November 2021 ASRs 30,405 (2) (2) 30,405 (2) Open market and privately negotiated purchases 27,770 $ 153.08 27,770 November 28, 2021 to December 25, 2021: Open market and privately negotiated purchases 24,218 $ 169.76 24,218 Total 123,809 $ 40,489 (1) As of December 25, 2021 , the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Program, announced on April 28, 2021, of which $274.5 billion had been utilized. The remaining $40.5 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the Program as of December 25, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In November 2021, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ ASRs”). Under the terms of the agreements, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $6.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the second quarter of 2022. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans During the three months ended December 25, 2021, Katherine L. Adams, Timothy D.

January 27, 2022 Apple Inc. By: /s/ Luca Maestri Luca Maestri Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Apple Inc. | Q1 2022 Form 10-Q | 23 APPLE INC. NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN (as amended November 9, 2021) On November 13, 2017, the Board adopted this Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (formerly known as the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Director Stock Plan, and, as renamed, the “Plan”), subject to approval by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual Meeting on February 13, 2018. The Plan was further amended by the Board as set forth herein, effective November 9, 2021. For the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to an Award, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the date such Award was granted. 1. PURPOSES. The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals Awards in respect of Shares. 2. ADMINISTRATION. The Administrator shall be responsible for administering the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to: (a) determining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award; (b) approving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan; (c) amending any outstanding Awards; (d) construing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan; (e) correcting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement; (f) adopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan; (g) authorizing any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan; (h) adjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any or all outstanding Options or otherwise changing previously imposed terms and conditions, in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate; (i) determining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and (j) making all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan. Each interpretation, determination, or other action made or taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator’s determinations under the Plan need not be the same for all persons. The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from ti me to time. Exhibit 10.1 1 3. SHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS. (a) SHARE LIMIT. Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 11,200,000 Shares (the “ Share Limit”). The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares. (b) SHARE COUNT. Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with the Award. Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates. If Awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Share Limit. Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Non-Employee Director or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan. (c) LIMIT ON COMPENSATION. In no event shall the compensation payable by the Company to a Non-Employee Director for services performed as a Non-Employee Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year. 4. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS . Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, each Non- Employee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator: (a) ANNUAL GRANTS. On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $275,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an “Annual RSU Award”). (b) INITIAL GRANTS . Each Non-Employee Director who first becomes a Non- Employee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by multiplying (i) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the dollar amount applied under Section 4(a) with respect to Awards granted at the immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B) the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an “ Initial RSU Award”); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting. 2 (c) VESTING; TERMINATION OF SERVICE . Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted. Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award. If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than the Non-Employee Director’s death, the Non-Employee Director’s Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units. If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director’s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director’s death. (d) SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS . On or as soon as administratively practical following the applicable Vesting Date (and in all events not later than two and one-half months after the applicable Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units that vested on the applicable Vesting Date. Upon settlement of any Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the foregoing provision of this Section 4(d) and settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid. (e) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly set forth in Section 4(f) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Restricted Stock Units until such Shares have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 4(d). Except for any Dividend Equivalent Rights awarded pursuant to Section 4(f) or as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto. (f) DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS DISTRIBUTIONS . As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “ Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c). 5. OPTIONS. (a) NO ADDITIONAL GRANTS. No Options shall be granted under the Plan unless and until the Board determines that the grant of Options is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 3 (b) EXERCISE PRICE. The per share exercise price of each Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the Option determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. (c) VESTING. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant. (d) TERM OF OPTIONS. i. TEN-YEAR TERM. Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from its date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein. ii. TERMINATION OF SERVICE . Upon cessation of a Non-Employee Director’s service as a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any of the Non-Employee Director’s Options (or any portion thereof) that is not then vested shall terminate, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Options. If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non- Employee Director’s Options shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director’s death. iii. EXERCISE FOLLOWING TERMINATIONS OF SERVICE . If a Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any Options granted to such Non-Employee Director that are exercisable at the time of the Non-Employee Director’s termination may be exercised by such Non- Employee Director at any time within ninety (90) days after the date of such Non- Employee Director’s termination of service, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above. At the end of such ninety- day period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire. If a Non- Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of his or her death, all of the Options granted to the Non-Employee Director may be exercised by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three (3) years after the date of the Non-Employee Director’s death, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above. At the end of such three-year period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire. (e) TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS. i. NOTICE OF EXERCISE . Subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be exercisable for a fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (A) the date on which the Company receives such written notice and (B) the date on which the Non-Employee Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii). ii. METHOD OF EXERCISE . The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A) cash, (B) check, (C) other Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised, (D) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. Without limiting the generality of the 4 foregoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator. iii. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof. (f) ISSUANCE OF SHARES . Subject to the foregoing conditions, as soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non- Employee Director’s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the Non- Employee Director (or such Beneficiary), the appropriate number of Shares to be issued in connection with such exercise. Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such other manner that the Administrator shall specify from time to time. Shares sold in connection with a “cashless exercise” shall be delivered to the broker referred to therein in accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time. 6. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER . An Award may not be transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that, with the approval of the Administrator, an Award may be transferred to a Non-Employee Director’s family members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members. An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director’s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous sentence. No assignment or transfer of an Award, or of the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect. 7. ADJUSTMENTS. (a) Upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, split-off or extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the Share Limit, maximums and number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3) the exercise price of any outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards. Any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the 5 circumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. (b) It is intended that, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, any adjustments contemplated by Section 7(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section 409A) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements. (c) Any adjustment under this Section 7 need not be the same for all persons or Awards. 8. CHANGE OF CONTROL. Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows: (a) CLIFF-VESTING AWARDS. If the Award has one scheduled Vesting Date, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control: (i) the number of Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from and including the date the Award was granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B) the denominator is the number of days from and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date. (b) INSTALLMENT-VESTING AWARDS . If the Award has multiple scheduled Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control: (i) the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest on the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control, multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B) the denominator is the number of days from and excluding such most recent Vesting Date to and including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control. 9. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. (a) BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS. Each Non-Employee Director may designate a Beneficiary to exercise an Option or receive settlement of an Award upon the Non-Employee Director’s death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator. (b) CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION . A Non-Employee Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator. The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the Administrator shall revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form. 10. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN. (a) TERMINATION. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate on November 12, 2027. Following such date, no further grants of Awards shall be made pursuant to the Plan. (b) GENERAL POWER OF BOARD . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time terminate, modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part (including amend the Plan at any time and from time to time, without shareholder approval, to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of Restricted Stock 6 Units and Options subject to Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors on the date of each Annual Meeting or upon becoming a Non-Employee Director and the methodology for determining the number of Shares to be subject to such Awards, each within the Share Limit and the individual limit set forth in Section 3, and the other terms and conditions applicable to such Awards) or, subject to Sections 10(c) and 10(d), amend the terms of any outstanding Award; provided, however, that no such termination, modification, suspension or amendment shall be effective without shareholder approval if such approval is required to comply with any applicable law or stock exchange rule; and provided further that the Board may not, without shareholder approval, increase the maximum number of Shares issuable under the Plan except as provided in Section 7. For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a prospective basis for grants under the Plan to consist of Options only, Restricted Stock Units only, or a combination of Options and Restricted Stock Units on such terms and conditions, subject to the Share Limit and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the Board. (c) WHEN NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS’ CONSENTS REQUIRED . The Board may not alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or amend the terms of any outstanding Award, without the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Awards that have previously been granted, except to the extent such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange listing rules or accounting rules. (d) NO REPRICING . In no case (except due to an adjustment contemplated by Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange or other means, including any action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of the per Share exercise price of any Option. 11. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) NO RIGHT TO NOMINATION . Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any of its members for reelection by the Company’s shareholders, nor confer upon any Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation. (b) REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS . The Administrator may require each Non- Employee Director or any other person purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements. Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law. No Shares shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws. (c) EXPENSES. The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company. 7 (d) APPLICABLE LAW. Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles. (e) SEVERABILITY. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect. (f) SECTION HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION . Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof. (g) AUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS . The existence of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s capital structure or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv) any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Subsidiary, (v) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (vi) the payment at the discretion of the Board of any type or form of compensation to Non-Employee Directors that may be made at law and without contravention of any requirement of the principal exchange upon which the Shares are traded, or (vii) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Company or any Subsidiary, whether of a similar character or otherwise. No Non-Employee Director, beneficiary or other person shall have any claim under any Award or Award Agreement against any member of the Board or the Company, or any employees, officers or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action. 12.

The Administrator may, however, provide with respect to one or more Awards that the Fair Market Value shall equal the last price for a Share on the Market on the last trading day preceding the date in question or the average of the high and low trading prices of a Share on the Market for the date in question or the most recent trading day. If Shares are no longer listed or are no longer actively traded on the Market as of the applicable date, the Fair Market Value of a Share shall be the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator for purposes of the Award in the circumstances. The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining Fair Market Value with respect to one or more Awards if a different methodology is necessary or advisable to secure any intended favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular Awards (for example, and without limitation, the Administrator may provide that Fair Market Value for purposes of one or more Awards shall be based on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date). “NET EXERCISED” shall mean the exercise of an Option or any portion thereof by the delivery to the person exercising such Option of the greatest number of whole Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise not in excess of the difference between the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option (or the portion of such Option then being exercised) and the aggregate exercise price for all such Shares under the Option (or the portion thereof then being exercised), with any fractional share that would result from such equation to be payable in cash. “NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR” means a member of the Board who is not an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. “OPTION” means an option to purchase Shares awarded to a Non-Employee Director under the Plan. 10 “RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT” means a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent of one Share, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and represents an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. “SHARE” means one share of Common Stock. “SUBSIDIARY” means any corporation or other entity a majority of whose outstanding voting stock or voting power is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by the Company. An entity that attains the status of a Subsidiary on a date after the adoption of the Plan shall be considered a Subsidiary commencing as of such date. “VESTING DATE” means, with respect to a particular Award, the date on which the Award vests in whole or in part. “VOTING SECURITIES” means, with respect to any corporation, securities of such corporation that are entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of such corporation. 11 Exhibit 31.1 CERTIFICATION I, Timothy D.
