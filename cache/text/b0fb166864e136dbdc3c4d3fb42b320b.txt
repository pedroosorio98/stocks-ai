Growth was led by exceptional Data Center demand for our Hopper architecture used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Ethernet for AI was another key contributor, including strong uptake of our Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform. Gross margin expanded year on year to 75.0% and we drove strong operating leverage with operating income rising 147% to $81.5 billion and diluted earnings per share increasing 147% to $2.94.

(3) Previously served as a member of our Board from 1993 until 2006. The Board recommends that you vote&#8239; FOR &#8239;each director nominee. Recent Refreshment and Nominee Qualifications Our director nominees exhibit a variety of competencies, professional experience, and backgrounds, and contribute diverse viewpoints and perspectives to our Board. While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge of our longer-serving directors, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas through the appointment of four new directors, and the retirement of three directors, since 2020. The Board also regularly rotates committee membership and chairpersons to promote a variety of viewpoints on the Board committees. The Board&#8217;s commitment to achieving a membership of diverse backgrounds is reflected in our Board composition. Five of our directors are women and four are ethnically and/or racially diverse. 7 Table of Contents Nominee Skills, Competencies, and Attributes Below are the skills, competencies, and attributes that our NCGC and Board consider important for our directors to have, considering our current business and future market opportunities, and the director nominees who possess them: Senior Leadership &amp; Operations Experience Industry &amp; Technical Financial /Financial Community Governance &amp; Public Company Board Emerging Technologies &amp; Business Models Marketing, Communications &amp; Brand Management Regulatory, Legal &amp; Risk Management Human Capital Management Experience Burgess &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Coxe &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Dabiri &#252; &#252; Drell &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Huang &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Hudson &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Jones &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Lora &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Neal &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Ochoa &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Seawell &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Shah &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Stevens &#252; &#252; &#252; &#252; Corporate Governance Highlights Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance to promote the long-term interests of the Company and our stockholders. We seek a collaborative approach to stockholder issues that affect our business and to ensure that our stockholders see our governance and executive pay practices as well-structured. In Fall 2024, we contacted our top institutional stockholders, representing an aggregate ownership of 31%, to gain insights into their views on our corporate governance, compensation and corporate sustainability practices. Highlights of our corporate governance practices include: &#252; All Board members independent, except for our CEO &#252; Independent Lead Director &#252; Proxy access &#252; Declassified Board &#252; Majority voting for directors &#252; Active Board oversight of risk management &#252; Stockholders can call a special meeting &#252; 75% or greater attendance by each Board member at meetings of the Board and applica ble committees &#252; Independent directors frequently meet in executive &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sessions &#252; At least annual Board and committee self-assessments &#252; Annual stockholder outreach, including Lead Director participation &#252; Stock ownership guidelines for our directors and NEOs As discussed below, in response to stockholder approval of a related non-binding stockholder proposal at the 2024 Meeting, Proposal 4 requests stockholder approval of an amendment and restatement of our Charter to remove its remaining supermajority voting provisions. Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2025 (Proposal 2) We are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding vote, also known as &#8220;say-on-pay,&#8221; to approve our NEOs&#8217; compensation. The Board believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving our goals of paying for performance, providing competitive pay so that we may attract and retain a high-caliber executive team, aligning our executives&#8217; interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value, and achieving simplicity and transparency with our compensation program. The Board and our stockholders have approved holding our &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221; votes annually. The Board recommends that you vote&#8239; FOR &#8239;Proposal 2. 8 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Highlights Our executive compensation program is designed to reward performance. We use compensation elements that align our NEOs&#8217; interests with those of stockholders to drive long-term value. Our NEOs&#8217; compensation is heavily weighted toward performance-based, &#8220;at-risk&#8221; variable cash and long-term equity awards, which are earned only if the Company achieves pre-established financial metrics, with caps on maximum payouts. In recent years, over 90% of our CEO&#8217;s and over 45% of our other NEOs&#8217; target pay has been performance-based and at-risk. Additionally, 100% of our CEO&#8217;s equity awards have been granted as PSUs. For Fiscal 2025, in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of executives&#8217; roles and responsibilities, the CC increased target equity opportunities for all NEOs. The CC also increased our CEO&#8217;s base salary and target variable cash opportunity for the first time in years to align with peers and ensure internal pay equity with the base salaries of other NEOs, and shifted the mix of performance-based equity towards MY PSUs for our NEOs (excluding our CEO) to give more weight to long-term performance incentives. To motivate executives, the CC set certain Base Compensation Plan goals significantly above strong Fiscal 2024 results and Threshold goals well above our Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan. Financial Performance and Link to Executive Pay As described in CD&amp;A , a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of financial measures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success. The table below shows our goals for the applicable periods that were completed at the end of Fiscal 2025 and their impact on our executive pay. PERFORMANCE GOALS Variable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs Fiscal 2025 Revenue Payout as a % of Target Opportunity Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income (1) Shares Eligible to Vest as a % of Target Opportunity Fiscal 2023 to 2025 3-Year Relative TSR Shares Eligible to Vest as a % of Target Opportunity Threshold $45.0 billion 50% $16.0 billion 50% 25th percentile 25% Base Compensation Plan $90.0 billion 100% $56.0 billion 100% 50th percentile 100% Stretch Compensation Plan $110.0 billion 200% $72.0 billion CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% 75th percentile CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT AND PAYOUTS Variable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs Performance Achievement for Period Ended Fiscal 2025 (2) $130.5 billion revenue $86.8 billion Non-GAAP Operating Income (1) 100th percentile 3-year TSR relative to S&amp;P 500 Payout as % of Target Opportunity 200% CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in CD&amp;A for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results. (2) See Performance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation in CD&amp;A for a description and further discussion of revenue, Non-GAAP Operating Income, and 3-year relative TSR. Ratification of Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2026 (Proposal 3) While not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC&#8217;s selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026, as we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders. The Board recommends that you vote&#8239; FOR &#8239;Proposal 3. Amend and Restate Charter to Remove All Supermajority Provisions (Proposal 4) At the 2024 Meeting, our stockholders approved a non-binding stockholder proposal requesting the Board to take steps to remove supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws. Following deliberation and engagement with stockholders, the Board approved, adopted and declared advisable an amendment and restatement of our Charter to remove the remaining supermajority voting provisions, remove inoperative provisions related to a previously effected forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, and implement other non-substantive clarifying changes, subject to stockholder approval. The full text of the Proposed Charter is included in Appendix A to this proxy statement, with proposed new text underlined and proposed deletions crossed out. Additionally, the Board plans to approve conforming amendments to NVIDIA&#8217;s Bylaws, contingent on stockholder approval of this Proposal 4. The Board recommends that you vote&#8239; FOR &#8239;Proposal 4. 9 Table of Contents Stockholder Proposal 5 A stockholder is asking our Board to remove the one-year holding period requirement in our Bylaws for stockholders to call a special meeting. Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance and has already adopted a balanced right for stockholders to call a special meeting. Our Board believes that our current Bylaws ensure stockholders have a right to call a special meeting to act on extraordinary, pressing events while preventing a minority of stockholders who have not held a financial stake in NVIDIA for a meaningful period of time from calling meetings for narrow or short-term interests. The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 5. Stockholder Proposal 6 A stockholder is asking our Board to amend its Corporate Governance Policies to adopt specific director resignation provisions if a director fails to receive a majority vote from stockholders. NVIDIA&#8217;s existing director resignation and corporate governance policies and procedures are already designed to ensure that the Board is fully accountable to NVIDIA&#8217;s stockholders. Our Board believes Proposal 6 seeks the adoption of additional unnecessary director resignation procedures and that our existing director resignation procedures strike the appropriate balance between ensuring director accountability and responsiveness and maintaining a role for the Board&#8217;s discretion and judgment. The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 6. Stockholder Proposal 7 A stockholder is asking our Board to publish a chart disclosing workforce data by EEOC-defined job categories, gender, and race.

Our 2025 Meeting will take place virtually on Wednesday, June 25, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Virtual Meeting Philosophy and Benefits The Board believes holding the 2025 Meeting in a virtual format invites stockholder participation, while reducing costs to stockholders and the Company. This balance allows the 2025 Meeting to remain focused on matters directly relevant to stockholder interests in an efficient way. We have designed the virtual format to protect stockholder rights, including by offering multiple opportunities to ask questions, publishing answers to questions received for the 2025 Meeting on our Investor Relations website, and providing a replay of the webcast after the 2025 Meeting. Meeting Attendance If you were an NVIDIA stockholder as of the close of business on the April 28, 2025 record date, or if you hold a valid proxy, you can attend, ask questions during, and vote at our 2025 Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVDA2025. Our 2025 Meeting will be held virtually; use the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card to enter. Anyone can also listen to the 2025 Meeting live; if you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual 2025 Meeting, please call the technical support number available at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVDA2025. A replay of the webcast will be available at www.nvidia.com/proxy through June 24, 2026. Even if you plan to attend the 2025 Meeting virtually, we recommend that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend. Asking Questions We encourage stockholders to submit questions through our pre-meeting forum at www.proxyvote.com (using the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card), as well as during the 2025 Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVDA2025. During the 2025 Meeting, we will answer as many stockholder-submitted questions related to the business of the 2025 Meeting as time permits. We will publish on our Investor Relations website answers to questions as soon as practicable after the 2025 Meeting. We intend to group questions and answers by topic and substantially similar questions will be answered only once. To promote fairness to all stockholders and efficient use of the Company&#8217;s resources, we will respond to one question per stockholder. We reserve the right to exclude questions that are not pertinent to company business or are otherwise unsuitable for the conduct of the 2025 Meeting. Quorum and Voting To hold our 2025 Meeting, we need a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the close of business on the April 28, 2025 record date, or a quorum, represented at the 2025 Meeting either by attendance virtually or by proxy. On April 28, 2025, there were 24,387,557,065 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, meaning 12,193,778,533 shares must be represented at the 2025 Meeting or by proxy to have a quorum. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will be available at our headquarters, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California, for 10 days prior to the 2025 Meeting to stockholders of record for any legally valid 12 Table of Contents purpose germane to the 2025 Meeting. To schedule an appointment to view the stockholder list during this period, please contact us at shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com. Your shares will count towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy or vote at the 2025 Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will count towards the quorum requirement. If there is not a quorum, a majority of the votes present may adjourn the 2025 Meeting to another date. For Proposal 1, you may vote FOR or AGAINST any Board nominee, or you may ABSTAIN from voting. For each other matter to be voted on, you may vote FOR or AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting. Stockholder of Record You are a stockholder of record if your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, on April 28, 2025. You can vote shares, change your vote, or revoke your proxy before the final vote at the 2025 Meeting in any of the following ways: Vote Change Your Vote Revoke Your Proxy Virtually attend and vote at the 2025 Meeting &#252; &#252; Via mail, by signing and mailing your proxy card to us before the 2025 Meeting &#252; By telephone or online, by following the instructions provided in the Notice or your proxy materials &#252; &#252; Submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date &#252; Send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to NVIDIA Corporation, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, Attention: Timothy S. Teter, Secretary, or via email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com &#252; If you do not vote using any of the ways described above, your shares will not be voted. Street Name Holder If your shares were held through a nominee, such as a bank or broker, as of April 28, 2025, then you were the beneficial owner of shares held in &#8220;street name,&#8221; and you have the right to direct the nominee how to vote those shares for the 2025 Meeting. The nominee should provide you a separate Notice or voting instructions, which you should follow to tell the nominee how to vote. To vote by attending the 2025 Meeting virtually, you must obtain a valid proxy from your nominee. If you are a beneficial holder and do not provide voting instructions to your nominee, the nominee will not be authorized to vote your shares on &#8220;non-routine&#8221; matters, including elections of directors (even if not contested) and executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation), the amendment of the Charter, and stockholder proposals. This is called a &#8220;broker non-vote.&#8221; However, the nominee can still register your shares as being present at the 2025 Meeting for determining quorum, and the nominee will have discretion to vote for matters considered by the NYSE to be &#8220;routine,&#8221; including Proposal 3 regarding the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. If you are a beneficial owner and want to ensure that all of the shares you beneficially own are voted for or against Proposal 3, you must give your nominee specific instructions to do so or the nominee will have discretion to vote on that proposal. For Proposals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which are &#8220;non-discretionary&#8221; items, you MUST give your nominee instructions in order for your vote to be counted. We strongly encourage you to vote. Any NVIDIA stockholder whose shares are held in street name by a member brokerage firm may revoke a proxy and vote their shares at the 2025 Meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures of the national stock exchanges, as used by the holder&#8217;s brokerage firm. 13 Table of Contents Vote Count On each matter to be voted upon, stockholders have one vote for each share of NVIDIA common stock owned as of April 28, 2025. Votes will be counted by the inspector of election as follows: Proposal Number Proposal Description Vote Required for Approval Effect of Abstentions Effect of Broker Non-Votes 1 Election of thirteen directors More FOR than AGAINST votes None None 2 Advisory approval of our executive compensation Majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter Against None 3 Ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026 Majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter Against N/A (1) 4 Approval of an amended and restated Charter to remove all supermajority provisions 66 2/3% of shares outstanding Against Against 5 Stockholder Proposal: Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement Majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter Against None 6 Stockholder Proposal: Director Election Resignation Governance Policy Majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter Against None 7 Stockholder Proposal: Workforce Data Reporting Majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter Against None (1) Because this is a routine proposal, there are no broker non-votes. If you are a stockholder of record and you return a signed proxy card without marking any selections, your shares will be voted FOR each of the nominees listed in Proposal 1, FOR Proposals 2, 3 and 4, and AGAINST Proposals 5, 6, and 7. If any other matter is properly presented at the 2025 Meeting, one of the proxyholders will vote your shares using his best judgment. Vote Results Preliminary voting results will be announced at the 2025 Meeting. Final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC by July 1, 2025. Proxy Materials As permitted by SEC rules, we are making our proxy materials available to stockholders online at www.nvidia.com/proxy. On or about May 13, 2025, we sent stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on April 28, 2025 (except those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) a Notice with instructions on how to access our proxy materials, vote online or by telephone, and elect to receive future proxy materials electronically or in printed form by mail. If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically (via www.proxyvote.com for stockholders of record and www.icsdelivery.com/nvda for street name holders), you will receive an email next year with links to the proxy materials and proxy voting site. SEC rules also permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy Notice and proxy material delivery requirements for multiple stockholders with the same address by delivering a single Notice or set of proxy materials addressed to those stockholders. We follow this practice, known as &#8220;householding,&#8221; unless we have received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. If you received more than one Notice or full set of proxy materials, your shares are either registered in more than one name or held in different accounts. Please vote the shares covered by each Notice or proxy card. To modify your instructions so that you receive one Notice or proxy card for each account or name, contact your broker. Your &#8220;householding&#8221; election will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. 14 Table of Contents To change how you receive proxy materials (electronically or in print), or to request receipt of a separate set of documents to a household, contact our Investor Relations Department through our website at www.nvidia.com, by email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com, by phone at (408) 486-2000, or by mail at 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051. We will pay the entire cost of soliciting proxies. Our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone, by mail, via the Internet, or by other means. Our directors and employees will not receive any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We have also retained MacKenzie Partners on an advisory basis for an approximate fee o f $17,000; they may help us solicit proxies from brokers, bank nominees, and other institutional owners. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks, and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. 2026 Meeting Deadlines for Submission of Stockholder Proposals, Nomination of Directors, and Other Business Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in Our Proxy Materials Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 Stockholders who wish to present proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act for inclusion in our 2026 Meeting proxy materials must submit their proposals in writing to NVIDIA Corporation, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, Attention: Timothy S.

Accordingly, our Board will consider feedback received through our stockholder engagement process regarding the process and disclosure requirements of our Bylaws for nominating directors and other proposals. Our Board will engage with stockholders of various holdings size regarding any proposed amendments to our Bylaws that would require a nominating stockholder to disclose to us (i) such stockholder&#8217;s plans to nominate candidates to the boards of other public companies, or disclose prior director nominations or proposals that such stockholder privately submitted to other public companies, or (ii) information about such stockholder&#8217;s limited partners or business associates beyond the existing requirements of our Bylaws. 15 Table of Contents Proposal 1&#8212;Election of Directors What am I voting on?

In accordance with our Corporate Governance Policies and the NCGC Charter, the NCGC is committed to maintaining a Board with diverse perspectives and considers a nominee&#8217;s background and experience to ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented. The NCGC may conduct appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates and may engage a professional search firm to assist the committee in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. &#160;The NCGC has not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill requirements, and instead considers numerous factors regarding the nominee, including those listed below, taking into account our current and future business models: &#8226; Integrity and candor &#8226; Independence &#8226; Senior leadership and operational experience &#8226; Professional, technical and industry knowledge &#8226; Financial expertise &#8226; Financial community experience (including as an investor in other companies) &#8226; Marketing, communications and brand management background &#8226; Governance and public company board experience &#8226; Experience with emerging technologies and new business models &#8226; Regulatory, legal, and risk management expertise, including in cybersecurity matters &#8226; Mix of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives &#8226; Human capital management experience &#8226; Experience in academia &#8226; Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to Board responsibilities and Company oversight &#8226; Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole rather than special interest groups or constituencies &#8226; All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of our stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers, or other persons with a relationship to NVIDIA &#8226; For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, including past attendance, participation and contributions to the activities of the Board and its committees The NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, diversity of professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board. While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas through the appointment of four new directors, and the retirement of three directors, since 2020. The Board also regularly rotates committee membership and chairpersons to help promote different viewpoints on the Board committees. Our longer-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic and competitive environments, which enhances the Board&#8217;s oversight of strategy and risks. Given the growth of the Company and the breadth of our product offerings, as well as the increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors we face, these experienced directors are a significant asset to the Board. Our newer directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity, familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions, and senior management, operating, and finance experience, all of which are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets. Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director&#8217;s individual performance, including the director&#8217;s past contributions, outside experiences and activities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board. 17 Table of Contents Below are the skills, competencies, and attributes that our Board considers important for our directors to have, considering our current business and future market opportunities: Senior Leadership &amp; Operations Experience Directors with senior leadership and operations experience provide informed oversight of our business, and unique experiences and perspectives. They are uniquely positioned to contribute practical insight into business strategy and operations, driving growth, building and strengthening corporate culture, and supporting the achievement of strategic priorities and objectives. Industry &amp; Technical Directors with industry experience and technical backgrounds facilitate within the Board a deeper understanding of innovations and a technical assessment of our products and services. Financial/Financial Community Experience in financial matters and the financial community assists our Board with review of our operations and finances, including overseeing our financial statements, capital structure and internal controls. Those with a venture capital background also offer valuable stockholder perspectives. Governance &amp; Public Company Board Directors with experience in corporate governance, such as service on boards and board committees, or as executives of other large, public companies, are familiar with the dynamics and operation of a board of directors and the impact that governance policies have on a company. This experience supports our goals of strong Board and management accountability, transparency, and protection of stockholder interests. Public company board experience also helps our directors identify challenges and risks we face as a public company, including oversight of strategic, operational, and compliance-related matters, and stockholder relations. Emerging Technologies &amp; Business Models Experience in emerging technologies and business models is integral to our growth strategies given our unique business model and provides important insights as our business expands into new areas. Marketing, Communications &amp; Brand Management Directors with experience in marketing, communications, and brand management offer guidance on our products directly marketed to consumers, important perspectives on expanding our market share, and expertise in communicating with our customers and other stakeholders. Regulatory, Legal &amp; Risk Management Our business requires compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. We face new regulatory matters and regulations as our business grows. We are also subject to multiple lawsuits. Directors with experience in governmental, public policy, legal, and risk management areas, including cybersecurity, help provide valuable insights and oversight for our Company. Human Capital Management Experience Our people are critical to our success. Directors with experience in organizational management, talent development, and developing values and culture in a large global workforce provide key insights. Human capital management experience also assists our Board in overseeing executive and employee compensation, development, and engagement.

He will serve on the CC and continue to serve on the NCGC after the 2025 Meeting. 25 Table of Contents Information About the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Independence of the Members of the Board of Directors Nasdaq rules and our Corporate Governance Policies (as further described below) require that a majority of our directors not have a relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities and that they meet any other qualification requirements required by the SEC and Nasdaq. After considering all relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined that, except for Mr. Huang, all of our directors are &#8220;independent&#8221; as defined by Nasdaq&#8217;s rules and regulations. The Board also determined that all members of our AC, CC, and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, and that each of Mr. Seawell, Mr. Jones and Ms. Lora of the AC are &#8220;audit committee financial experts&#8221; as defined under applicable SEC rules. Board Leadership Structure Our Board ensures that each member has an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA by having an independent Lead Director, rather than a chairperson, which the Board believes best serves our stockholders. The independent directors consider the role and designation of the person to serve as Lead Director on an annual basis. The Board recognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate under different circumstances and its annual review includes consideration of whether having a Lead Director continues to best meet NVIDIA&#8217;s evolving needs and serves in the best interest of its stockholders. Our Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because: &#8226; The active involvement of each of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities of, and strong oversight by, our Lead Director, provide balance on the Board; &#8226; It promotes independent oversight of our management and affairs; &#8226; It effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and our independent directors; and &#8226; It provides the right foundation to pursue the Company&#8217;s strategic and operational objectives, particularly in light of the evolution of our business and operating environment. Our CEO has primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, and the Lead Director facilitates our Board&#8217;s independent oversight of management, promotes communication between management and our Board, and supports our Board&#8217;s consideration of key governance matters. This arrangement promotes open dialogue among the Board, including discussions of the independent directors during quarterly executive sessions led by our Lead Director, without the presence of our CEO. We believe that our current structure best serves our stockholders, without the need to appoint a person to serve as chairperson of the Board. Under our Corporate Governance Policies, the Board may select a chairperson in its discretion, but, if it does not, a Lead Director shall be designated annually by a majority of the independent directors and identified in the Company&#8217;s proxy statement. These policies help to ensure a robust independent leadership structure on our Board. While the Board has discretion to consider other leadership structures, including having the Lead Director (or chairperson, if any) and CEO roles filled by a single individual, it would only consider a change if it best aligned with the interests of our stockholders, management, and the Board, and it complied with applicable laws and regulations. If in the future our CEO were to take a leadership position on the Board, such as chairperson, we expect that the Board would continue to appoint an independent Lead Director to maintain a balanced and strong leadership structure and otherwise represent the Board independently from the Company&#8217;s management team. Any changes to the Board&#8217;s leadership structure would take into account stockholder views, including through our ongoing stockholder outreach, and would be communicated to stockholders on our Investor Relations website and in our proxy statement. Our Lead Director may provide input on the design of the Board as requested by the NCGC. In his role as NCGC Chairperson, our Lead Director will continue to lead discussions, provide input, and oversee the design of the Board itself. Our Lead Director Stephen C. Neal Director since 2019 Chairperson of the NCGC Experience &#252; Extensive experience as a trial attorney &#252; Has advised numerous companies, boards and individuals on governance and legal matters &#252; Helped clients manage internal and government investigations &#252; Executive experience as Cooley LLP&#8217;s CEO, and board and chairman experience on the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. board of directors 26 Table of Contents The Board believes Mr. Neal&#8217;s experience, breadth of knowledge, and contributions to the Board position him well to provide strong leadership, oversight, and the ability to contribute valuable insight with respect to the Company&#8217;s business. Our Lead Director may require Board consideration of risk matters, including adding them to Board agendas or as topics for executive sessions of the independent members of the Board. The Board believes that Mr. Neal is highly qualified to assist the Board in overseeing the identification, assessment, and management of the Company&#8217;s exposure to various risks as a result of his extensive risk management, legal, and executive experience and provides effective independent oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk exposures as Lead Director. Further information on the Board&#8217;s oversight of risk management and its work with the CEO to address risk management matters is detailed below under Role of the Board in Risk Oversight . Our Lead Director has significant responsibilities, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and include the duties listed below. Duties of Our Lead Director &#252; Determining an appropriate schedule of Board meetings and seeking to ensure that the independent members of the Board can perform their duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of our operations &#252; Working with the CEO, and seeking input from other directors and relevant management, as to the preparation of the agendas for Board meetings &#252; Advising the CEO on a regular basis as to the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the flow of information requested by the Board from our management with the goal of providing what is necessary for the independent members of the Board to effectively and responsibly perform their duties, and, although our management is responsible for the preparation of materials for the Board, the Lead Director may specifically request the inclusion of certain material &#252; Coordinating, developing the agenda for, and moderating executive sessions of the independent members of the Board and acting as principal liaison between them and the CEO on sensitive issues &#252; Presiding over Board meetings when the CEO is not present &#252; Convening meetings of the independent directors, as necessary or appropriate &#252; Engaging with stockholders, as necessary or appropriate &#252; Performing such other duties as the Board may determine from time to time In addition, our Lead Director may represent the Board in communications with stockholders and other stakeholders. The Lead Director makes themself available for consultation with major stockholders pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. As Lead Director, Mr. Neal has participated in our annual stockholder outreach meetings and we expect this practice to continue. 27 Table of Contents Committees of the Board of Directors The Board has three committees: an AC, a CC, and a NCGC. Each of these committees operates under a written charter, which may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com. Committee assignments are determined based on background and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a committee. Our Board believes regular committee rotations are a good corporate governance practice which introduces diverse perspectives and ideas, more fully informs its members regarding the full scope of the Board and our activities, and benefits each committee and the Board as a whole.

ERM Process &#252; Annual assessment of the Company&#8217;s risk environment led by management &#252; Identifies and evaluates risks across different timeframes, including short-, intermediate- and long- term &#252; Identifies, assesses, and manages the Company&#8217;s most significant risks and uncertainties that could materially impact the long-term health of the Company or prevent the achievement of strategic objectives &#252; Regular updates reported to senior management, including CEO &#252; Overseen and reviewed by the Board and AC, at least annually &#252; Board and committees have direct access to management to receive updates on risk exposures and mitigation strategies, and give feedback on key and emerging risks, including cybersecurity, trade compliance, risk management and the ERM process &#252; Board and committee agendas adjusted throughout the year by CEO and Lead Director to address emerging risks and key topics &#252; Includes interviews with senior management and Board members to identify major risks &#252; The Board, its committees, and senior management may engage outside advisors, experts, and consultants to help develop and analyze the Company&#8217;s risk management and mitigation efforts, and anticipate future threats and trends The Company&#8217;s ERM process is an annual assessment of its risk environment, integrating risk evaluation with the Company&#8217;s operations and strategies. This process examines internal and external factors, risk amplifiers, and emerging trends to prioritize mitigation efforts based on the risk horizon. It evaluates the potential impact and likelihood of risks materializing over relevant timeframes, considers future threats and trends, and identifies the actions, strategies, processes, controls, and procedures in place or to be implemented to manage and mitigate these risks. While the Company does not have a Chief Compliance Officer, the ERM process and action plan are reviewed by the CEO, other NEOs reporting directly to the CEO, and senior management members. These leaders are responsible for managing and monitoring key risks within their respective functional areas. The Company&#8217;s internal audit team administers the ERM program on behalf of management. The ERM process is designed to align the Board&#8217;s risk oversight with the Company&#8217;s disclosure controls and procedures. Public reports are prepared by management involved in the ERM process and reviewed by the Board or its committees to ensure that disclosure controls and procedures function effectively. These processes are structured to identify potential risks for disclosure appropriately. Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Policies The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Board has the necessary authority and processes in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent of our management. These policies include practices the Board follows with respect to its composition and selection, regular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, senior management performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation. These policies may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com. Executive Sessions of the Board As required under Nasdaq&#8217;s listing standards, our independent directors meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with the CEO. In Fiscal 2025, our independent directors met in both types of executive sessions at four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings. Director Attendance at Annual Meeting We expect that our directors will attend each annual meeting, absent a valid reason. All Board members attended the 2024 Meeting, except Dr. Ochoa who was appointed after the 2024 Meeting. 31 Table of Contents Board Self-Assessments The NCGC oversees an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside legal counsel for NVIDIA interviews each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on which he or she serves. The interviews solicit ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Board and/or committee oversight, effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensation, acquisition activity, and other key matters. The interviews also focus on Board process and identifying specific issues which should be discussed in the future. After these evaluations are complete, our outside corporate counsel summarizes the results, reviews them with our Lead Director, and then submits the summary for discussion by the NCGC. In response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2025, our Board determined to focus on geopolitical and regulatory risks, supply chain, AI regulations, growth management, the Company&#8217;s strategic ecosystem, and management development. The Board also determined to continue to focus on the Board&#8217;s composition and process for Board refreshment. Director Orientation and Continuing Education The NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving eligible director continuing education programs. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination of internally developed materials and presentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative support for attendance at qualifying academic or other independent programs. Director Time Commitment and Outside Board Memberships Our directors are expected to devote sufficient time to Board and committee duties and to understanding the Company&#8217;s business. The NCGC reviews the other commitments of potential Board candidates, and does so annually for existing Board members, to determine if this expectation can be met. In making this determination, the NCGC considers, among other factors, stakeholder guidelines regarding numerical limits on public company boards on which a director may sit. None of our directors serve on more than two public company boards (including NVIDIA), and none of our non-employee directors serve as a CEO or executive officer of a public company. Director Stock Ownership Guidelines Our Corporate Governance Policies require each non-employee director to hold shares of our common stock with a total value equal to six times the annual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a director (or ten times his base salary, in the case of the CEO). The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held in trust, and shares held by immediate family members, but not unvested or unexercised equity awards. Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownership threshold. Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests. Each non-employee director and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the exception of Dr. Ochoa, who joined our Board in 2024 and has five years from joining the Board to reach the ownership threshold. Senior Management Development We believe in extensive leadership development. Our structure ensures that many senior managers work directly with our CEO to execute our corporate strategies. This approach results in strategic alignment, exposes leaders to a broad spectrum of corporate activities, and presents the Board with a pool of excellent candidates for future promotion. Our CEO also selects senior leaders to engage directly with the Board on key initiatives and provides periodic updates to our Board on management development. Outside Advisors The Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our expense. The Board need not obtain management&#8217;s consent to retain outside advisors. In addition, the principal committees need not obtain either the Board&#8217;s or management&#8217;s consent to retain outside advisors. Code of Conduct Our directors, executives, and employees are expected to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics, and honesty. Our credibility and reputation depend upon their good judgment, ethical standards, and personal integrity. Our Code of Conduct applies to all executive officers, directors, and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The Financial Team Code of Conduct applies to our executive officers, directors, members of our finance department, and all employees involved in the preparation and review of externally-reported periodic financial reports, filings, and documents. We regularly review our Code of Conduct and related policies to ensure that they provide clear guidance to our directors, executives, and employees. We also regularly train our employees on our Code of Conduct and other policies. 32 Table of Contents The Code of Conduct and the Financial Team Code of Conduct may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website, at www.nvidia.com. If we make any amendments to either code, or grant any waiver from a provision of either code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on our website or in a report on Form 8-K. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the SEC. Insider Trading Policy Our Insider Trading Policy governs transactions in our securities and applies to the Board and our employees, contractors, and consultants. We believe our Insider Trading Policy is reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations applicable to NVIDIA. Section 16 directors and officers must obtain preclearance before trading in NVIDIA&#8217;s stock. In addition, we comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to insider trading with respect to transactions in our securities such as open market repurchases of our common stock from time to time. Under our Insider Trading Policy, hedging ownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to NVIDIA stock or debt, is not permitted. Additional prohibitions include purchasing NVIDIA stock on margin, borrowing against NVIDIA stock held in a margin account, or pledging NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan. Corporate Hotline We have established an independent corporate hotline to allow any employee, contractor, customer, or partner to confidentially and anonymously submit a complaint about any accounting, internal controls, auditing, Code of Conduct, or other matter of concern (unless prohibited by local privacy laws). Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors Stockholders who wish to communicate with the Board regarding nominations of directors or other matters may do so by sending electronic written communications addressed to Timothy S. Teter, our Secretary, at shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com. All stockholder communications we receive that are addressed to the Board will be compiled by our Secretary. If no particular director is named, letters will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, to the chairperson of the AC, CC, or NCGC. Matters put forth by our stockholders will be reviewed by the NCGC, which will determine whether these matters should be presented to the Board. The NCGC will give serious consideration to all such matters and will make its determination in accordance with its charter and applicable laws. Majority Vote Standard Under our Bylaws, in an uncontested election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast votes FOR or AGAINST the election of directors or to ABSTAIN from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors. A director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director, meaning the number of shares voted FOR a director must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST that director. If the votes cast FOR an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the number of AGAINST votes, such incumbent director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The NCGC or other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on such committee&#8217;s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale within 90 days from the date of certification of the election results. In making their decision, such committee and the Board will evaluate the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and shall consider all factors and information deemed relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in such committee&#8217;s recommendation or the Board&#8217;s decision. In a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, stockholders will be given the choice to cast FOR or WITHHOLD votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors. Our directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented at any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors at that meeting. The directors receiving the greatest number of FOR votes will be elected. In either case, abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will have no effect on the vote. Stockholder Special Meeting Right As part of our Board and management&#8217;s comprehensive review of current corporate governance practices, our Board amended our Bylaws in 2024 to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares, and who have owned such shares continuously for at least one year, to request a special meeting of stockholders, provided that the stockholders satisfy the disclosure, timing and other requirements set forth in our Bylaws intended to ensure that stockholders receive adequate, timely, and accurate information in connection with a special meeting. Our Board believes that this special 33 Table of Contents meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting the Company and its stockholders from narrow, short-term interests. Board Meeting Information The Board met four times during Fiscal 2025, including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic direction of NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and other matters facing NVIDIA. We expect each Board member to attend each meeting of the Board and the committees on which he or she serves. Each Board member attended 75% or more of the applicable meetings of the Board and of each committee on which he or she served during Fiscal 2025. 34 Table of Contents Corporate Sustainability NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound CS principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. Our Board and management believe that environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and solid governance are important to our business strategy and long-term value creation. While the full Board has ultimate responsibility for CS matters that impact our business, each committee of the Board oversees CS matters across our business operations in the areas that align with their respective responsibilities. The NCGC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our policies, issues, and reporting related to sustainability, including overall sustainability strategy, risks, and opportunities, and related programs and initiatives. Our CS team updates the NCGC at least semiannually on these topics, as well as pertinent regulations and stakeholder inputs, and gathers feedback from the NCGC on issues such as climate change and human rights. The CS team also reports on sustainability issues to the full Board annually. In Fiscal 2024, we launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee, or the CSSC, comprised of members of our executive leadership team. The CSSC oversees and provides input on our sustainability strategy and program. Feedback from the Board, the NCGC and CSSC, along with specific input from our executive team, helps to determine the focus and scope of our sustainability strategy and program. The following sections provide an overview of our sustainability principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Sustainability section of our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information contained on our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the SEC. Refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in our Form 10-K for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to CS. Climate and Efficiency We assess our carbon footprint across our product lifecycle and assess climate risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts. Improving performance and energy efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our research, development, and design processes, and our product-level environmental assessments confirm that continuing to enhance the energy efficiency of our products is the most impactful sustainability initiative our company can pursue. NVIDIA GPUs powered 8 of the top 10 systems on the November 2024 Green500 list, including the top super computer. Our Earth-2 initiative aims to harness AI and high-performance computing to unlock the potential of vast quantities of climate data to inform decision-making. We commit to the following greenhouse gas emissions, or GHG emissions, reduction goals: &#8226; Scope 1 and 2: In our upcoming Sustainability Report for Fiscal 2025, we plan to announce that we achieved and will maintain 100% renewable electricity for offices and data centers under our operational control. By delivering on this commitment, we continue to aim to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with prevalent climate science standards. &#8226; Scope 3: By the end of Fiscal 2026, we expect to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA&#8217;s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions, with the goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets. Human Capital Management We believe that our employees are our greatest asset, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. The CC provides oversight of the Company&#8217;s human capital management, including policies and strategies relating to human capital management. To execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including exceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff. Recruitment As the demand for global technical talent remains high, we have grown our technical workforce and have successfully attracted top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent worldwide through our strong employer brand and differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 82% technical and 51% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased our focus on diversity recruiting, and we welcome employees of all backgrounds. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 41% of our new hires in Fiscal 2025 coming from employee referrals. Development and Retention To support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted development programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We constantly upgrade our learning offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer 35 Table of Contents tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications and encourage internal job mobility. We have also implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement. To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In Fiscal 2025, our overall turnover rate was 2.5%. Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company&#8217;s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees&#8217; and their families&#8217; physical health, well-being, and financial health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We offer tailored benefits based on the needs of our employees, including continuing support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at NVIDIA We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all our employees. When recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates. To this end we: &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit; &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities; &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Enlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and identify internal opportunities; &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Support the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders; &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Provide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups; &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Provide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our employees to excel; &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee feedback; and &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Measure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts. As of the end of Fiscal 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees. We strive to provide equitable compensation and opportunities for advancement to all employees and to achieve promotion parity based on a variety of considerations. Flexible Working Environment We support a flexible work environment, allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. We also provide company-wide designated time off each quarter for employees to rest, recharge and manage personal and family responsibilities. 36 Table of Contents Product Value Chain We seek to promote human rights throughout our supply chain and expect our suppliers to respect human rights whenever they provide products or services for us. We are a full member of the RBA, an international industry organization dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains. Since adopting the RBA Code of Conduct in 2007 when we first became an RBA member, we have continued to integrate its elements into our processes, including auditing strategic suppliers and conducting internal assessments to confirm that we are addressing all aspects of responsible supply chain management. All of our manufacturing suppliers are expected to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and associated NVIDIA policies, including an Agreement for Manufacturer Environmental Compliance. We expect our suppliers to maintain progressive employment, environmental, health, safety, and ethical practices that meet or exceed applicable laws, the RBA Code of Conduct, our Code of Conduct, and our Human Rights Policy. We also encourage suppliers to use the RBA Code of Conduct as a platform to go above and beyond compliance. We monitor our supply chain through Validated Assessment Program audits and work directly with suppliers to implement any corrective actions. Our goal is to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products and to achieve 100% Responsible Minerals Assurance Process-compliant 3TG processing facilities, as explained in more detail in our Responsible Minerals Policy. Human Rights We define human rights as the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment belonging to all humans. We follow the laws of the countries in which we operate, and endorse internationally recognized principles, including the United Nations Global Compact, the United Nations Guiding Principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization, and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We have codified our approach to human rights in our Human Rights Policy and work to embed human rights considerations into decision-making processes throughout the Company. In Fiscal 2025, we ran a human rights impact assessment (HRIA) aligned with the UN Declaration on Business and Human Rights. The HRIA covered our value chain and was performed by an independent firm with deep expertise in human rights. We expect to use the results of the HRIA to inform our human rights strategy and our Human Rights Policy going forward. Trustworthy AI Our artificial intelligence, or AI, principles, which we share with customers and partners, reflect our core values and our Code of Conduct. We endeavor to deliver trustworthy AI models that comply with privacy and data protection laws, perform safely and as intended, provide transparency about a model&#8217;s design and limitations, minimize unwanted bias, and give equal opportunity to benefit from AI. Our products are programmable and non-specific in nature. When we provide tools to help developers create applications for specific industries, we focus on creating products and services that enable developers to create and accelerate socially beneficial applications. Public Policy Engagement and Accountability Our NCGC oversees and periodically reviews our public policy engagement and accountability. Our Government Relations team engages in the public policy process to advance the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders, including in areas relevant to our operations, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, global trade, research and development, workforce and energy. NVIDIA&#8217;s U.S. federal lobbying activities are disclosed quarterly and publicly reported. We belong to trade associations worldwide. Management reports to the NCGC about our policies and practices in connection with governmental relations, public policy, and related expenditures. 37 Table of Contents Director Compensation NVIDIA&#8217;s non-employee director compensation program is designed to attract and retain a world-class Board of Directors while balancing our stockholders&#8217; interests, and is structured to align with annual service starting on the dates of our annual meetings. We do not pay additional fees for serving as Lead Director, as chairperson or member of our committees, or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive compensation for service on the Board. Roles of the Board, the CC, and Compensation Consultant The CC reviews our director compensation annually with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, who provides peer group data and insights on compensation trends and best practices. The CC engaged Exequity LLP as its independent compensation consultant to advise on director compensation for the year following our 2024 Meeting, or the 2024 Program. The CC recommended the 2024 Program as described below, which the Board approved in December 2023. Afterwards, our compensation advisor from Exequity retired, and in September 2024, the CC engaged Semler Brossy to serve as its independent compensation consultant. 2024 Program The 2024 Program maintained the same target compensation as the previous year with a total value of $340,000&#8212;slightly below the median paid to peer group non-employee directors (based on the peer group determined in late 2023): (1) Target annual value of RSUs granted on the day following our 2024 Meeting, or the 2024 Program RSUs. 50% of the 2024 Program RSUs vested on the third Wednesday in November 2024 and 50% will vest on the third Wednesday in May 2025, subject to the director&#8217;s continuous service. The number of shares subject to each director&#8217;s 2024 Program RSUs equaled the target value of the grant divided by the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our common stock that ended the business day before the 2024 Meeting, to smooth the effects of market volatility. New Director Compensation In connection with Dr. Ochoa's appointment to the Board in November 2024, she received a prorated annual cash retainer and two RSU grants. She was awarded an initial RSU grant with a target value of $255,000, or the Initial Ochoa RSU, and a prorated 2024 Program RSU reflecting her service until the 2025 Meeting, or the Prorated Ochoa RSU. The number of shares subject to the Initial Ochoa RSU was calculated in the same manner as the 2024 Program RSUs, but using the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price that ended the business day before her appointment. Deferred Compensation Program Non-employee directors can elect to defer the settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes. Deferrals can be made to the earlier of (i) the third Wednesday of March of a future year (no sooner than 2026 for the 2024 Program RSUs and Prorated Ochoa RSU, or 2028 for the Initial Ochoa RSU) or (ii) the director&#8217;s cessation of service or certain change-in-control events, in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Other Compensation/Benefits Our directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings, and continuing educational programs. We do not offer change-in-control benefits to directors, except for vesting acceleration under our equity plans that applies to all plan award holders if an acquirer does not assume or substitute those awards, provided that the award holder&#8217;s continuous service with us has not terminated prior to the change-in-control. If a director&#8217;s service terminates due to death, their RSU grants will immediately vest in full. Directors do not receive dividends on unvested, or vested but deferred, RSUs. 38 Table of Contents Director Compensation for Fiscal 2025 Name Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) Stock Awards ($) (1) Total ($) Robert K.

Instead, these amounts reflect the aggregate full grant date fair value calculated in accordance with ASC 718 for RSU awards. The assumptions used in the calculation are set forth in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled Stock-Based Compensation in our Form 10-K. On June 27, 2024, each non-employee director then serving on the Board received their 2024 Program RSU grant for 2,088 shares, with an ASC 718 grant date fair value per share of $123.96.

Subject to Dr. Ochoa&#8217;s continuous service with us, the Initial Ochoa RSU will vest as to 1/6th of the shares on the third Wednesday in June 2025 and approximately every six months thereafter, and the Prorated Ochoa RSU will vest in full on the third Wednesday in May 2025.

This policy is included in our Code of Conduct and our Financial Team Code of Conduct. We regularly conduct a review of all related party transactions for potential conflicts of interest and all transactions involving executive officers or directors must be approved by the NCGC in compliance with the Company&#8217;s policies and the Listing Standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Except as discussed below, there were no transactions with related persons in Fiscal 2025 that would require disclosure in this proxy statement or approval by the NCGC. Transactions with Related Persons The daughter and son of Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and CEO and a member of our Board, are employed by the Company. Neither of them shares a household with Mr. Huang, is one of our executive officers, or reports directly to Mr. Huang. Additionally, the son of Dr. Shah, one of our directors, has been employed by the Company since February 2024. He does not share a household with Dr. Shah and is not one of our executive officers. The compensation of these individuals was determined in accordance with NVIDIA&#8217;s compensation practices applicable to employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions and without the involvement of Mr. Huang or Dr. Shah, respectively. The total compensation for Fiscal 2025 of the daughter and son of Mr. Huang was approximately $1,130,000 and $530,000, respectively. The total compensation for Fiscal 2025 of the son of Dr. Shah was approximately $475,000. Each of them has received and continues to be eligible for equity awards on the same general terms and conditions as applicable to employees in similar positions who do not have such family relationships. We have entered into indemnity agreements with our executive officers and directors. The agreements provide that we will indemnify them, under certain circumstances, for liabilities they may be required to pay in actions or proceedings by reason of their position with NVIDIA, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, our Charter, and our Bylaws. We intend to execute similar agreements with our future executive officers and directors. See Employment, Severance, and Change-in-Control Arrangements below for a description of the terms of the 2007 Plan, related to a change-in-control of NVIDIA. During Fiscal 2025, we granted RSUs to our non-employee directors, and RSUs and PSUs to our executive officers (other than Mr. Huang, who received PSUs only). See Director Compensation above and Executive Compensation below. 40 Table of Contents Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management The following table sets forth information as of March 24, 2025 as to shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each of our NEOs, each of our directors, all of our directors and executive officers as a group, and all known by us to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table.

A non-binding vote, known as &#8220;say-on-pay,&#8221; to approve our Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation. Vote required for approval : A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. Effect of abstentions : Same as a vote AGAINST. Effect of broker non-votes : None. In accordance with Section&#160;14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote on an advisory basis, commonly referred to as &#8220;say-on-pay,&#8221; to approve the Fiscal 2025 compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in the CD&amp;A , the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative discussion. This vote is intended to address the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this proxy statement, rather than any specific compensation component. In response to our stockholders&#8217; preference, our Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221; votes. This advisory proposal is not binding on the Board nor us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by our stockholders are important to the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the CC intend to consider the results of this vote in making future NEO compensation decisions. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution: &#8220; RESOLVED , that the Fiscal 2025 compensation paid to the Company&#8217;s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item&#160;402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED .&#8221; 43 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis This CD&amp;A describes our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation philosophy, design, and process, and how our corporate results affected the payout of performance-based awards. Our Fiscal 2025 NEOs were: Jen-Hsun Huang, President and CEO; Colette M. Kress, EVP and CFO; Ajay K. Puri, EVP, Worldwide Field Operations; Debora Shoquist, EVP, Operations; and Timothy S. Teter, EVP, General Counsel and Secretary. Fiscal 2025 Executive Compensation Summary Continued Focus on Pay for Performance NVIDIA&#8217;s executive compensation program in Fiscal 2025 continued to be guided by a pay for performance philosophy to link competitive NEO pay with our stockholders&#8217; interests. Approximately 95% of our CEO&#8217;s, and approximately 48% of our other NEOs&#8217;, total target pay was dependent on corporate performance. Executive Pay Heavily Weighted Towards Equity Awards The vast majority of our NEOs&#8217; total target pay for Fiscal 2025 was comprised of equity awards: &#8226; SY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, vesting over 4 years, &#8226; MY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500, vesting over 3 years, and &#8226; RSUs vesting over 4 years (for NEOs other than our CEO) (1) Based on total target pay as approved by the CC, consisting of annual base salary, and, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals at a Base Compensation Plan level, target payout opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan and target equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver. (2) Reflects the average total target pay mix for our NEOs other than our CEO. The total does not sum to 100% due to rounding. NEOs were also eligible for variable cash awards based on annual revenue, in addition to base salary and other compensation and benefits. Key Changes for Fiscal 2025 &#8226; CEO Cash Compensation Adjustments : increased base salary and variable cash opportunity to align with peers and for internal pay equity, after years without changes &#8226; Increased Target Equity Opportunities for All NEOs : increased target equity opportunities in recognition of the expanding complexity and scope of their roles and responsibilities &#8226; Equity Mix Shift for NEOs Other than CEO : adjusted allocation of target equity across RSUs, SY PSUs, and MY PSUs for NEOs other than Mr. Huang from 40%, 55%, and 5% in Fiscal 2024 to 50%, 25%, and 25% in Fiscal 2025, respectively, to emphasize long-term performance incentives while encouraging retention &#8226; Further Increased Rigor of Performance Goals : set Base Compensation Plan for target variable cash and SY PSU opportunities well above strong Fiscal 2024 results, and set Threshold goals well above Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan, to motivate executives Record Performance Resulting in Maximum Payouts Fiscal 2025 Revenue Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income (1) 3-Year TSR Relative to S&amp;P 500 (Fiscal 2023 to 2025) (2) $130.5 billion $86.8 billion 384% (100th Percentile of S&amp;P 500) (1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results. (2) Represents TSR for purposes of the MY PSU performance goal, calculated using cumulative stock price appreciation with dividends reinvested and the average closing stock price for the 60 trading days preceding the start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period. As a result of the above performance achievements, each exceeding the CC&#8217;s pre-established Stretch Compensation Plan goals, our NEOs earned the maximum payouts possible for our Fiscal 2025 Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025, and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023. 44 Table of Contents Our Compensation Philosophy and Practices NVIDIA is building a one-of-a-kind company that invents the future, builds amazing technologies, and strives to achieve the highest level of craft. To achieve this vision, we must attract and retain a high-caliber executive team while balancing our stockholders&#8217; interests. While our CC considers numerous factors in making executive pay decisions, our compensation program is guided by the following philosophies: &#8226; Pay for Performance : emphasize at-risk and performance-based cash and equity for NEOs based on multiple corporate metrics &#8226; Provide Competitive Pay : structure competitive NEO target compensation to reflect job impact, scope, and responsibilities, that attracts and retains talent &#8226; Stockholder Alignment : align NEO pay with stockholders&#8217; long-term interests and consider feedback from our annual stockholder engagement efforts and &#8220;say-on-pay&#8221; vote &#8226; Simplicity and Transparency : design a compensation program with simple, objective metrics In this CD&amp;A , total target pay refers to (i) an NEO&#8217;s annual base salary, (ii) target variable cash opportunity, which means the potential payout under our Variable Cash Plan, assuming the Company achieves the associated performance goal at a Base Compensation Plan level, and (iii) target equity opportunity, which means the value of the equity opportunities granted during the year that the CC intended to deliver, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals at a Base Compensation Plan level. Our executive compensation program adheres to the following practices: What We Do What We Don&#8217;t Do &#252; Emphasize at-risk, performance-based compensation, with simple, objective performance goals X Enter into agreements with NEOs providing for specific terms of employment or severance benefits &#252; Use annual and multi-year performance targets to determine PSU awards earned X Give our executive officers special change-in-control benefits &#252; Set rigorous performance goals and use different metrics for annual and multi-year awards X Provide automatic equity vesting upon a change-in-control (except for the provisions in our equity plans that apply to all employees if an acquiring company does not assume or substitute our outstanding stock awards) &#252; Require NEOs to provide continuous service for 4 years to fully vest in SY PSU and RSU awards X Give NEOs supplemental retirement benefits &#252; Evaluate our program annually based on feedback from stockholder engagement efforts and make adjustments when appropriate X Provide tax gross-ups &#252; Mitigate compensation risks X Pay dividends or the equivalent on unearned or unvested equity &#252; Cap performance-based variable cash and PSU payouts X Permit executive officers, employees, or directors to hedge their ownership of NVIDIA stock or to pledge NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan &#252; Retain an independent compensation consultant reporting directly to the independent CC &#252; Require NEOs to maintain meaningful stock ownership &#252; Maintain a clawback policy for performance-based compensation How We Determine Executive Compensation The CC&#8217;s oversight and decision-making for our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program was a multi-year process: November 2023 December 2023 March 2024 March 2025 April - May 2025 CC determined peer companies Members of management and the Board, including our Lead Director, engaged in stockholder outreach CC considered stockholder feedback and peer companies in determining performance goals and compensation CC certified achievement and payouts for Fiscal 2025 Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023* CC oversaw compensation risk assessment; published executive compensation program details in proxy statement * The CC is expected to certify achievement and payouts for MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 by March 2027. 45 Table of Contents Roles of the CC, Compensation Consultant, and Management The roles of (i) our CC; (ii) our independent compensation consultant, Exequity; and (iii) management, including our CEO, CFO, and Human Resources and Legal departments, are summarized below. For our Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation program, our CC continued to use Exequity for its experience working with our CC and with compensation committees at other technology companies. Our CC analyzed whether Exequity&#8217;s role raised any conflict of interests, taking into consideration the following: &#8226; Exequity did not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we paid Exequity on the CC&#8217;s behalf); &#8226; The percentage of Exequity&#8217;s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC&#8217;s behalf; &#8226; Exequity&#8217;s conflict of interest policies and procedures; &#8226; Any business or personal relationship between Exequity and an executive officer, or between Exequity&#8217;s individual compensation advisors and an executive officer or any member of our CC; and &#8226; Any NVIDIA stock owned by Exequity or its individual compensation advisors. After considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity&#8217;s work did not create any conflict of interests. Our CC reviews and approves all NEO compensation decisions, with input from Mr. Huang and Exequity. At the CC&#8217;s direction, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our Fiscal 2025 executive pay program, which the CC approved. Management gathered peer data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, or the Radford Survey, which informed Exequity&#8217;s analysis of Mr. Huang&#8217;s compensation, and Mr. Huang&#8217;s recommendations for other NEOs. The CC considered Exequity&#8217;s advice, Mr. Huang&#8217;s recommendations, and management&#8217;s proposed Fiscal 2025 performance goals that were informed by the Company&#8217;s operating plan, before making its final decisions on Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation. The CC certified compensation payouts for performance periods that concluded at the end of Fiscal 2025 under the Variable Cash Plan and for SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023. The CC also oversaw management&#8217;s Fiscal 2025 compensation risk analysis. Subsequent to the determination of our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program, our compensation advisor from Exequity retired. In September 2024, the CC engaged Semler Brossy to act as its independent compensation consultant. After consideration of the factors outlined above, our CC determined that Semler Brossy&#8217;s role did not create any conflict of interest. Peer Companies and Market Compensation Data We believe our peers should be companies that compete with us for executive talent, have a similar business complexity and market presence, and are of comparable size, measured by revenue and market capitalization at approximately 0.5-3.5x ours. After consulting with management, and based on Exequity&#8217;s recommendation, the CC determined in November 2023 that the existing peer group remained appropriate for Fiscal 2025, with two adjustments: (i) removing Texas Instruments Incorporated due to its revenue and market capitalization falling below our target range, and (ii) adding Meta Platforms, Inc. as a competitor for talent with revenue and market capitalization being within our target range: Fiscal 2025 Peer Group Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM) Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) SAP SE (SAP) Intel Corporation (INTC) Visa Inc. (V) Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Our CC selected each member of the peer group based on a combination of factors described above. As a result, while some peer companies fell below our targeted size range, the CC determined they were still appropriate due to their established businesses and relevance as competitors for talent. To determine our Fiscal 2025 peer group, the CC reviewed our trailing 12-month revenue (reported through our third quarter results for Fiscal 2024) and market capitalization as of November 2023. They compared these metrics to the 75th percentile, median, and 25th percentile of peer group companies, as follows: Revenue (in billions) Market Capitalization (in billions) Fiscal 2025 Peer Group 75th Percentile $53.27 $329.65 Fiscal 2025 Peer Group Median $35.13 $207.65 Fiscal 2025 Peer Group 25th Percentile $31.91 $155.22 NVIDIA $44.87 $1,074.43 46 Table of Contents For our NEOs other than our CEO, Mr. Huang reviewed market practices and compensation data from the Radford Survey and peer company proxy data for comparable executives before recommending their Fiscal 2025 compensation. The CC reviewed the same information for peer companies&#8217; CEOs, before determining the components of our executive compensation program, as well as total compensation, for all NEOs. We compared the total compensation opportunity for our NEOs and similarly situated executives at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of peer company data where available, and the CC considered the factors below in setting NEO compensation. Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation In addition to peer data, our CC considers the following factors in making executive compensation decisions. The weight given to each factor may differ among NEOs and each component of pay, and is subject to the CC&#8217;s sole discretion. &#252; The need to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive industry &#252; Each NEO&#8217;s unvested equity &#252; Stockholder feedback regarding our executive pay &#252; Internal pay equity relative to similarly situated executives &#252; The desire for simplicity of the overall program and transparency of the performance metrics &#252; Our CEO&#8217;s recommendations for the other NEOs, including his understanding of each NEO&#8217;s performance, capabilities, and contributions &#252; An NEO&#8217;s past performance and anticipated future contributions &#252; Our CC&#8217;s independent judgment &#252; Our financial performance and forecasted results, as well as our prior financial performance and resulting impact on our executives&#8217; compensation &#252; Our philosophy that an NEO&#8217;s total compensation opportunity and percentage of at-risk pay should increase with responsibility &#252; Changes in the scale and complexity of our business &#252; The total compensation cost and stockholder dilution, including from executive compensation, to maintain a responsible cost structure for our compensation programs * &#252; Each NEO&#8217;s current total compensation &#252; The scope and complexity of the department(s) or function(s) the NEO manages * See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation of our Form 10-K consolidated financial statements for a discussion of stock-based compensation cost. Fiscal 2025 Compensation Actions and Achievements Stockholder Outreach and Feedback We value stockholder feedback and conduct an annual outreach program. In Fall 2023, in preparation for Fiscal 2025 compensation decisions, we contacted our top institutional stockholders representing an aggregate ownership of 31%. Management and the Board, including our Lead Director, met with stockholders holding 14% of our shares to discuss topics including executive compensation. Stockholders provided positive feedback on pay versus performance linkage and expressed interest in additional performance-based compensation with multi-year performance periods. In response to this feedback and considering our 92% say-on-pay approval rate for Fiscal 2023 NEO compensation, our CC maintained generally the same elements and performance-based metrics for Fiscal 2025, but (i) increased target equity opportunities for all NEOs in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of their roles, (ii) raised Mr. Huang&#8217;s base salary and target variable cash opportunity for the first time in years, and (iii) shifted the mix of performance-based equity more heavily toward MY PSUs. Our CC believed that structuring performance-based components of our executive pay program solely around NVIDIA&#8217;s financial performance goals continued to align management&#8217;s incentives with stockholder interests. 47 Table of Contents Total Target Compensation Approach In setting Fiscal 2025 compensation, our CC reviewed each NEO&#8217;s total target pay opportunity and distribution across multiple pay elements. Our CC compared Mr. Huang&#8217;s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target total cash opportunity, target equity opportunity, and total target pay opportunity against chief executives at peer companies. For other NEOs, Mr. Huang reviewed their total target pay against similarly situated executives at peer companies where the data was available, considering internal pay equity, individual performance, unvested equity levels, and the increasing complexity of their roles. These factors informed Mr. Huang&#8217;s recommendations to the CC. The CC also considered the factors outlined in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and its compensation objectives for Fiscal 2025. Rather than applying a formula or assigning specific weights to each factor, our CC used its judgment and experience to set total target compensation, the mix of cash and equity, and fixed and at-risk pay opportunities for each NEO. When setting pay elements, the CC evaluated them in the context of the levels of the other pay elements and total target pay to ensure alignment with program objectives. The CC established amounts and designed a structure to reward NEOs with above-market value from equity awards and variable cash incentives only upon exceptional corporate performance. Components of Pay The primary components of NVIDIA&#8217;s Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program are summarized below: Fixed Compensation At-Risk Compensation Base Salary Variable Cash SY PSUs MY PSUs RSUs (1) Form Cash Cash Equity Equity Equity Who Receives NEOs NEOs NEOs NEOs NEOs except our CEO Performance Measure N/A Revenue (determines cash payout) Non-GAAP Operating Income (determines number of shares eligible to vest) TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500 (determines number of shares eligible to vest) N/A Performance Period N/A 1 year 1 year 3 years N/A Vesting Period N/A N/A 4 years from grant 3 years from grant 4 years from grant Vesting Terms N/A N/A If at least Threshold achieved, 25% on approximately the 1-year anniversary of the grant date; 6.25% quarterly thereafter If at least Threshold achieved, 100% on approximately the 3-year anniversary of the grant date 6.25% vests quarterly from the grant date (2) Timeframe Emphasized Annual Annual Long-term Long-term Long-term Purpose Compensate for expected day-to-day performance Reward for annual corporate financial performance Align with stockholder interests by linking NEO pay to annual operational performance and ongoing stock price performance during the vesting period Align with long-term stockholder interests by linking NEO pay to multi-year relative shareholder return and ongoing stock price performance during the vesting period Align with stockholder interests by linking NEO pay to ongoing stock price performance Maximum Amount That Can Be Earned N/A 200% of target opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan 150% of Mr. Huang&#8217;s SY PSU target opportunity and 200% of our other NEOs&#8217; respective SY PSU target opportunity Ultimate value delivered depends on stock price on date earned shares vest 150% of Mr. Huang&#8217;s MY PSU target opportunity and 200% of our other NEOs&#8217; respective MY PSU target opportunity Ultimate value delivered depends on stock price on date earned shares vest 100% of grant Ultimate value delivered depends on stock price on date shares vest (1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our CC considers RSUs to be at-risk pay because the realized value depends on our stock price, a financial performance measure. (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reflects vesting schedule for annual performance RSU grants. Our NEOs have insurance benefits and are eligible to participate in our ESPP and 401(k) plan on the same basis as our other employees. We also provide limited perquisites to our NEOs from time to time. See Other Compensation and Benefits below for more information. Pay Mix Considerations For Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that cash compensation would remain constant (other than for Mr. Huang, whose salary and target variable cash had not been adjusted in years) and that the largest portion of NEOs&#8217; total target pay would remain in the form of at-risk equity. The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results and increases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive and retain our NEOs. PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits as PSUs require achieving predetermined performance goals, and both PSUs and RSUs require longer service (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years for SY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest. 48 Table of Contents Given Mr. Huang&#8217;s position as CEO, the CC determined that 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performance-based, to tightly align his interests with stockholders. Consistent with prior years, the CC split his target equity opportunity evenly between SY PSUs (aligned with our annual corporate financial performance) and MY PSUs (aligned with our 3-year relative shareholder return). For other NEOs, the CC adjusted the equity mix to increase the weighting of target MY PSU opportunity to further align NEO and stockholder long-term interests, resulting in 50% of the target equity opportunity granted as RSUs and 50% as PSUs, evenly split between SY and MY PSUs. The CC determined this structure balanced performance over short- and long-time horizons while providing a meaningful amount of time-vesting RSUs as a retention benefit. Setting Executive Compensation Values For Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that increases to each NEO&#8217;s total target pay were appropriate in light of the increasing scope and complexity of their roles and responsibilities, and internal pay equity considerations. The CC raised Mr. Huang&#8217;s total target pay by $7 million to align more closely with the median of peer company CEOs. Specifically, his base salary increased by 50%, to $1.5 million, which aligned with the 75th percentile of peers. The CC believed this was appropriate in consideration of internal pay equity with the base salaries of other NEOs and as it represented Mr. Huang&#8217;s first base salary increase in 10 years. His target variable cash opportunity remained at 200% of base salary, increasing to $3 million, which aligned with the median of peers. Mr. Huang&#8217;s target equity opportunity increased by 25%, to $27.5 million, which aligned slightly above the median of peers. The CC split the target equity increase evenly between SY PSUs and MY PSUs to balance short- and long-term performance-based awards. For other NEOs, the CC similarly adjusted target equity opportunities by $3 to $3.5 million, in recognition of the growing scope and complexity of their roles, while maintaining internal pay equity. Determining Equity Award Amounts To determine the actual number of RSUs and target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs awarded to our NEOs, the CC divided the value of the target equity they intended to deliver by the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our common stock ending on the last day of the calendar month prior to the date of grant. They used this methodology instead of calculating based on the stock price on the grant date to smooth the effects of possible market volatility. The CC understands that using a historical average stock price can cause the ASC 718 grant date value of an award, as required to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, to be different than the target equity opportunity. The CC considered various approaches to granting awards and determined the process described above is appropriate. The target number of SY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Base Compensation Plan. If the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Stretch Compensation Plan or more, the maximum SY PSUs eligible to vest would be capped at 150% of Mr. Huang&#8217;s SY PSU target equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs. If the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Threshold, the minimum SY PSUs eligible to vest would be 50% of each NEO&#8217;s SY PSU target equity opportunity. The target number of MY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500 from the start of Fiscal 2025 to the end of Fiscal 2027, or the 3-Year Relative TSR, at Base Compensation Plan. If the Company achieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Stretch Compensation Plan or more, the maximum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be capped at 150% of Mr. Huang&#8217;s MY PSU target equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs. If the Company achieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Threshold, the minimum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be 25% of each NEO&#8217;s MY PSU target equity opportunity. The CC capped the payout for Mr. Huang&#8217;s SY PSUs and MY PSUs at 150% of his target equity opportunity instead of 200% that applied to other NEOs because all of his Fiscal 2025 equity compensation was performance-based. With these caps, Mr. Huang would have the same total upside opportunity on his equity awards as the other NEOs, who had 50% of total equity opportunity granted as RSUs that vest based solely on continued service and therefore did not have the same upside opportunity. 49 Table of Contents No PSUs would be eligible to vest if the applicable Threshold performance level was not achieved. Any PSUs determined to be unearned would be cancelled. Performance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation In March 2024, when making decisions regarding Fiscal 2025 executive compensation, the CC intended for performance goals to be rigorous, uncertain, and set at levels that would motivate our NEOs, informed by the Company&#8217;s Fiscal 2025 operating plan. As a result, the CC set Base Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2025 revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income well above our record Fiscal 2024 results, and set respective Fiscal 2025 Threshold goals well above the Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan. Fiscal 2025 performance metrics and goals for NEO pay were as set forth below: PERFORMANCE METRICS Variable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs Metric Revenue Non-GAAP Operating Income TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500 Timeframe 1 year 1 year 3 years CC&#8217;s Rationale for Metric Drives value, contributes to Company&#8217;s long-term success Focuses on growth in new and existing markets Distinct, separate metric from Non-GAAP Operating Income Drives value, contributes to Company&#8217;s long-term success Reflects our annual revenue generation and effective operating expense management Distinct, separate metrics from revenue Aligns directly with long-term shareholder value creation Provides comparison of our stock price performance, including dividends, against a capital market index in which we compete Relative performance goal accounts for macroeconomic factors impacting the market PERFORMANCE GOALS Variable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs Fiscal 2025 Revenue Payout as a % of Target Opportunity (1) Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income (2) Shares Eligible to Vest as a % of Target Opportunity (1) Fiscal 2025 to 2027 3-Year Relative TSR (3) Shares Eligible to Vest as a % of Target Opportunity (1) Threshold $45.0 billion 50% $16.0 billion 50% 25th percentile 25% Base Compensation Plan $90.0 billion 100% $56.0 billion 100% 50th percentile 100% Stretch Compensation Plan $110.0 billion 200% $72.0 billion CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% 75th percentile CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% (1) For achievement between Threshold and Base Compensation Plan, or alternatively between Base Compensation Plan and Stretch Compensation Plan, payouts would be determined using straight-line interpolation. Achievement less than Threshold would result in no payout, and achievement exceeding Stretch Compensation Plan would result in the capped maximum payout. (2) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results. (3) MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 cover the Fiscal 2025 to Fiscal 2027 performance period. MY PSUs covering the Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2025 performance period were granted in Fiscal 2023 and consist of the same performance goal structure and payout opportunities. Each of the performance goal levels as described above were set by the CC with the following objectives: &#8226; Threshold was uncertain, but attainable and high enough to create value; represented an appropriately decelerated payout for performance below Base Compensation Plan. &#8226; Base Compensation Plan was uncertain but attainable with significant effort and execution success; included budgeted investments in future businesses and revenue growth considering macroeconomic conditions and reasonable but challenging growth estimates for ongoing and new businesses. &#8226; Stretch Compensation Plan required exceptional achievement; only possible with strong market factors and a very high level of management execution and corporate performance. Fiscal 2025 Performance Achievement As a result of record performance on strength across all market platforms, led by Data Center demand for our Hopper architecture used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications, revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income for Fiscal 2025 exceeded their respective Stretch Compensation Plan goals, as did our Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2025 3-year TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500. 50 Table of Contents In March 2025, the CC certified the Company&#8217;s performance achievement with the following payouts: PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT AND PAYOUTS Variable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs (1) Performance Achievement for Period Ended Fiscal 2025 (2) $130.5 billion revenue $86.8 billion Non-GAAP Operating Income (3) 3-year TSR of 384% 100th percentile relative to S&amp;P 500 Payout as % of Target Opportunity 200% CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% (4) CEO 150% Other NEOs 200% (5) (1) Represents performance achievement and payout of MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023, with a performance period measured from the start of Fiscal 2023 to the end of Fiscal 2025. (2) Revenue is GAAP revenue, as the Company reports in its SEC filings. Non-GAAP Operating Income is GAAP operating income, as the Company reports in its SEC filings, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition termination cost, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring costs and other, IP-related and legal settlement costs, and other. Consistent with prior years, 3-year TSR for purposes of the MY PSUs represents cumulative stock price appreciation, with dividends reinvested, and is measured based on the average closing stock price for the 60 trading days preceding the start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period. This averaging period mitigates the impact of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period. (3) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results. (4) 25% of the eligible SY PSUs vested on March 19, 2025, approximately one year after grant, and 6.25% will vest every quarter thereafter for the next three years. (5) 100% of the eligible MY PSUs vested on March 19, 2025. Achievement of goals for MY PSUs granted during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 will be determined after the applicable performance periods conclude in January 2026 and January 2027, respectively. Fiscal 2025 Target Compensation Actions and Performance-Based Payouts The CC&#8217;s target Fiscal 2025 compensation actions are summarized below for each NEO, reflecting the target variable cash and equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver, as well as the variable cash earned and PSUs which became eligible to vest. The CC considered the factors set forth in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation above to set total target pay opportunity for each NEO, which are described in Fiscal 2025 Compensation Actions and Achievements - Setting Executive Compensation Values above. The target equity opportunities presented in the tables below reflect the number of shares underlying each NEO&#8217;s equity awards granted in Fiscal 2025, calculated by assuming achievement at Base Compensation Plan for PSUs, and multiplying by the 30-day trailing average closing price of our common stock that the CC used in approving such equity awards, as described above in Determining Equity Award Amounts . These values differ from those reported in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, which, in accordance with SEC rules, reflect the ASC 718 grant date fair value of each NEO&#8217;s equity awards based on the single day closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and, for PSUs, assuming a probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions.

In Fiscal 2025, these security arrangements included (i) residential security, consultation fees, and driver services, (ii) security monitoring, and (iii) car expenses. Mr. Huang&#8217;s Fiscal 2025 security costs increased compared to the prior year due to increased travel. We do not consider these security arrangements to be personal benefits because they arise from Mr. Huang&#8217;s duties and responsibilities and are required by the Board&#8217;s executive security program. However, we are reporting the aggregate incremental costs to NVIDIA for security arrangements that are required to be reported in the &#8220;All Other Compensation&#8221; column of the Summary Compensation Table below. We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, necessary and in the best interests of NVIDIA and its stockholders, as they enable Mr. Huang to focus on his duties and responsibilities to the Company while reducing security threats and mitigating risks to our business. The CC annually oversees the nature and cost of executive security measures. When evaluating potential perquisites, we consider many factors, including the cost relative to the anticipated business benefit, perceived value to our executives, peer data, as well as corporate governance considerations. We also provide medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance, matches for health savings account contributions, as well as paid time off and holidays, for our NEOs on the same basis as our other employees. Our NEOs may participate, also on the same basis as our other employees, in our ESPP (unless prohibited by Internal Revenue Service rules) and our 401(k) plan, which included a Company match of up to $11,500 for 2024 and 2025. For Fiscal 2025 (which consisted of most of 2024 and a portion of 2025), our NEOs received the following 401(k) matches: $13,042 for Mr. Huang, $14,000 for each of Ms. Kress and Mr. Teter, and $11,500 for each of Mr. Puri and Ms. Shoquist. We believe these benefits are consistent with those offered by peers competing for executive talent. In Fiscal 2025, we did not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our NEOs. Equity Grant Timing Practices The CC approves all equity award grants to our executive officers on or before the grant date. Typically, the CC completes its annual executive compensation review, sets performance goals and target compensation, and grants equity awards in March . This process is described in How We Determine Executive Compensation above . On occasion, the CC may grant equity awards outside of our annual cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes. While the CC has discretionary authority to approve such awards, it does not have a practice or policy of granting equity awards in anticipation of the release of material non-public information. In Fiscal 2025, we did not tim e the release of material non-public information in coordination with equity award grants in a manner that intentionally benefits the value of our executive compensation. Stock Ownership Guidelines The Board believes that executive officers should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Since June 2024, our Corporate Governance Policies require the CEO to hold shares valued at ten times his base salary, and our other NEOs to hold shares valued at three times their respective base salaries. Shares that count toward the ownership guidelines include those held directly by the NEO, in trust for the NEO or immediate family, and vested but deferred shares, but not unvested equity awards. NEOs have up to five years from appointment to reach their ownership threshold. These 53 Table of Contents guidelines are intended to align NEO interests with stockholder interests. Each NEO currently exceeds the stock ownership requirements. Compensation Recovery Policy We have maintained a Compensation Recovery Policy since 2009, and amended it in 2023 to comply with Nasdaq&#8217;s listing standards. Our policy requires the Company to recover certain incentive compensation from current or former executive officers in connection with certain restatements of financial statements, if the compensation exceeds the amount that the officers would have received based on the restated financial statements, subject to limited exceptions. Tax and Accounting Implications Under Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company&#8217;s &#8220;covered employees&#8221; that exceeds $1 million per year is generally non-deductible. The CC considers various factors when making its decisions and retains flexibility to provide non-deductible compensation if consistent with the Company&#8217;s executive compensation program goals and the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The CC may also modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from the deduction limit if the modifications are consistent with the Company&#8217;s business needs. The CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and strives to avoid possible adverse tax consequences.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures A reconciliation between our GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income is as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024 GAAP operating income $81,453 $32,972 Stock-based compensation expense 4,737 3,549 Acquisition-related and other costs 602 583 Other (3) 30 Non-GAAP Operating Income $86,789 $37,134 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance stockholders&#8217; overall understanding of our historical financial performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the compensation programs of NVIDIA on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement. In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K of NVIDIA for the year ended January&#160;26, 2025 and in this proxy statement. Compensation Committee Dawn Hudson, Robert K. Burgess, Tench Coxe, John O. Dabiri, and Aarti Shah 54 Table of Contents Risk Analysis of Our Compensation Plans Under CC oversight, management assessed the Company&#8217;s Fiscal 2025 overall compensation programs and policies to identify any resulting potential material risks. The assessment focused on programs with payout variability and participants&#8217; ability to directly affect payout and related controls&#8212;specifically, the Company&#8217;s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs. The review identified key program terms and risks, and specific risk mitigation features. The CC considered these findings and concluded that our compensation programs, which are structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. The CC believes that the following compensation design features mitigate against risk : &#252; Our compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-term goals, and balances incentives by using a mix of base salary and variable pay &#252; We design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on achievement of various corporate performance targets to balance upside opportunity and downside risk, and we cap the potential award payout &#252; We have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which are used to measure and determine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs &#252; Financial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and SY PSUs are approved by the CC and informed by the annual financial plan approved by the Board each year &#252; MY PSUs are designed with a relative goal &#252; We have a compensation recovery policy applicable to executive officers that requires NVIDIA to recover certain incentive compensation paid in connection with certain accounting restatements &#252; The CC monitors burn rate and overhang &#252; All executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting &#252; We have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive officers&#8217; interests with those of our stockholders &#252; Our insider trading policy prohibits hedging, pledging, using margin accounts, and trading in derivatives involving our common stock which prevents our employees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performance 55 Table of Contents Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 The following table summarizes information regarding the compensation earned by our NEOs during Fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.

(7) Includes an aggregate of 335,826 shares that were withheld to pay taxes due upon vesting. Employment, Severance, and Change-in-Control Arrangements Employment Agreements. &#160;&#160;Our executive officers are &#8220;at-will&#8221; employees and we do not have employment, severance, or change-in-control agreements with our executive officers. Change-in-Control Arrangements. &#160;&#160;Our 2007 Plan provides that in the event of a corporate transaction or a change-in-control, outstanding stock awards may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving corporation. If the surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) with respect to any stock awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction, the vesting and exercisability provisions of such stock awards will be accelerated in full and such stock awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control, and (b)&#160;all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control. These change-in-control arrangements apply to stock awards held by our NEOs on the same basis as our other employees. 59 Table of Contents Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control Upon a change-in-control or certain other corporate transactions of NVIDIA, unvested RSUs, and PSUs will fully vest in some cases as described above under Employment, Severance, and Change-in-Control Arrangements&#8212;Change-in-Control Arrangements. The table below shows our estimates of the amount of the benefit each of our NEOs would have received if the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by them as of January&#160;26, 2025 had become fully vested as a result of a change-in-control, calculated by multiplying the number of unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the applicable NEO by the closing price ($142.62) of NVIDIA&#8217;s common stock on January&#160;24, 2025, the last trading day before the end of our Fiscal 2025, as reported by Nasdaq.

The two tables below reflect the actual numbers of the SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023 that became eligible to vest, based on our performance during the relevant performance period for such awards, as certified by our CC shortly after the end of Fiscal 2025. The values of the estimated and actual SY PSUs and MY PSUs in the table below were calculated by multiplying the applicable number of SY PSUs and MY PSUs held by each respective NEO and listed below, by the closing price ($142.62) of NVIDIA&#8217;s common stock on January&#160;24, 2025, the last trading day before the end of our Fiscal 2025, as reported by Nasdaq.

Teter 18,070 2,577,143 36,140 5,154,287 The actual number of MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 that will become eligible to vest will be determinable after January 25, 2026 and January 31, 2027, respectively, the ending dates of the applicable three-year measurement period for MY PSUs. Pay Ratio We determined the ratio of: (a) the annual total compensation of our CEO to (b) the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, except for our CEO, both calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Because there have been no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the end of Fiscal 2024 that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure for Fiscal 2025, we used the median employee from our Fiscal 2024 pay ratio calculation in our Fiscal 2025 pay ratio calculation. We determined our Fiscal 2024 median employee by using a consistently applied compensation measure, which aggregated, for each employee employed by us on the last day of Fiscal 2024, or January 28, 2024: (i) target base salary as of January 28, 2024 (annualized for permanent employees who were employed by us for less than the entire fiscal year), (ii) variable cash earned during Fiscal 2024, and (iii) aggregate full grant date fair value of equity awards granted during Fiscal 2024, calculated in accordance with ASC 718 and assuming the probable outcome of the conditions at Base Compensation Plan for performance-based awards. Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on January 28, 2024. 60 Table of Contents Our median employee&#8217;s total compensation for Fiscal 2025 was $301,233. Our CEO&#8217;s Fiscal 2025 total compensation was $49,866,251. Therefore, our Fiscal 2025 CEO to median employee&#160;pay ratio&#160;was 166:1. This pay ratio represents a reasonable estimate of the relationship between the compensation of our CEO and that of our median employee for Fiscal 2025, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and applicable guidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each company may use a different methodology, apply different exclusions, and make different assumptions. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to ours. Pay Versus Performance NVIDIA&#8217;s executive compensation program is guided by a pay for performance philosophy and is designed to align NEO pay with our stockholders&#8217; interests. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our NEOs&#8217; total compensation is based on the Company&#8217;s performance under certain corporate financial metric goals, which for Fiscal 2025 included annual revenue, annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, and 3-year TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500. Amounts set forth below as &#8220;compensation actually paid,&#8221; or CAP, have been calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and do not represent the value of compensation actually paid to or received by our NEOs. For a discussion of our executive compensation program and philosophy, refer to our CD&amp;A above. The following table summarizes information regarding compensation for our NEOs, including CAP as well as certain financial performance metrics, during Fiscal 2021-2025. Fiscal 2022-2025 were 52-week years. Fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year.

(9) Our Company-Selected Measure, as required by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, is Non-GAAP Operating Income , which, in our assessment, represents the most important financial performance measure linking Fiscal 2025 NEO CAP to company performance. See Definitions above for a definition of Non-GAAP Operating Income, and see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures above in CD&amp;A for a reconciliation between GAAP operating income and non-GAAP Operating Income.

Ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026. Vote required for approval : A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. Effect of abstentions : Same as a vote AGAINST. Effect of broker non-votes : Not applicable (because this is a routine proposal, there are no broker non-votes). The AC has selected PwC, which has audited our financial statements annually since 2004, to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026. Our lead audit partner at PwC will serve no more than five consecutive years in that role. Stockholder ratification of the AC&#8217;s selection of PwC is not required by our Bylaws. As a matter of good corporate governance, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our stockholders for ratification. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC in its sole discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders. The AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders to retain PwC. We expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2025 Meeting. The PwC representative will have an opportunity to make a statement at the 2025 Meeting if he or she so desires and will also be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered accounting firm for our fiscal year ending January 25, 2026. 64 Table of Contents Fees Billed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The following is a summary of fees billed or expected to be billed by PwC for Fiscal 2025, and fees billed by PwC for Fiscal 2024, for audit, audit related, tax, and other professional services during each fiscal year: Fiscal&#160;2025 Fiscal&#160;2024 Audit Fees (1) $ 8,067,106&#160; $ 6,686,412&#160; Audit Related Fees (2) 724,806&#160; 804,258&#160; Tax Fees (3) 856,439&#160; 1,164,399&#160; All Other Fees (4) 354,000&#160; 352,000&#160; Total Fees $ 10,002,351 &#160; $ 9,007,069 &#160; (1) For the audit of our consolidated financial statements, including the audit of our internal control over financial reporting, review of our quarterly financial statements and annual reports, and fees related to statutory audits of some of our international entities. (2) For a review of select sustainability metrics, system and organization controls reporting, and other attestation services. (3) For tax compliance, consulting, and tax audit defense services. (4) For products or services other than those referenced above, including a cybersecurity maturity assessment and subscription to accounting disclosure software. All services provided for Fiscal 2025 and 2024 described above were pre-approved by the AC or the AC Chairperson through the authority granted to him by the AC, which is described below. Our AC determined that the rendering of services other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC&#8217;s independence. Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures The AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified permissible services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services, and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the AC&#8217;s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to provide each service. In some cases, the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a year related to a particular defined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to the AC Chairperson to pre-approve additional audit and non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and approval is required prior to the next scheduled meeting of the AC. The AC Chairperson then communicates such pre-approval to the full AC at its next meeting. 65 Table of Contents Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors The material in this report is not &#8220;soliciting material,&#8221; is not deemed &#8220;filed&#8221; with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent specifically incorporated by reference therein. The Audit Committee, or AC, oversees accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, financial practices, and audit activities of NVIDIA and its subsidiaries. The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the accounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control over financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2025, was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a report on the consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January&#160;26, 2025. PwC&#8217;s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters are required to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes. Also, the AC has ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm. NVIDIA has an internal audit function that reports to the AC. This function is responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of our business processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of our internal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met. The AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or conduct audits, determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP, or assess our internal control over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the information provided by our management and on the representations made by management that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. In this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2025 with management and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC. We have received from PwC the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC&#8217;s communications with the AC concerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certain permitted non-audit services by PwC is compatible with PwC&#8217;s independence and discussed PwC&#8217;s independence with PwC. Based on the AC&#8217;s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form&#160;10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January&#160;26, 2025. Audit Committee A. Brooke Seawell, Harvey C. Jones, Melissa B. Lora, Aarti Shah, and Mark A. Stevens 66 Table of Contents Proposal 4&#8212;Approval of an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Remove All Supermajority Provisions What am I voting on? Approval of an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to remove all supermajority provisions. Vote required: Sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%)&#8239;of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation, voting together as a single class. Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. Effect of broker non-votes: Same as a vote AGAINST. Background At the 2024 Meeting, our stockholders approved a non-binding stockholder proposal requesting the Board eliminate supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws. The Board of Directors made no recommendation with respect to the proposal in order to fully understand the viewpoints of our stockholders on the matter. After due deliberation and engagement with stockholders, the Board approved, adopted and declared advisable an amendment and restatement of our Charter to eliminate the remaining supermajority voting provisions described herein, eliminate inoperative provisions relating to a previously effected forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, and implement other non-substantive clarifying changes, subject to stockholder approval. The full text of the Proposed Charter is set forth in Appendix A to this proxy statement with proposed new text underlined and proposed deletions crossed out. The Board also intends to approve conforming amendments to our Bylaws, contingent upon stockholder approval of this Proposal 4. Description of the Proposed Charter Amendments Article V, paragraph A(3) of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the voting power of the voting stock of the corporation then outstanding shall be required to remove directors without cause. Article V, paragraph B(1) of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the voting power of the voting stock of the corporation then outstanding shall be required to alter, amend or adopt new Bylaws. Article VII, paragraph B of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the voting power of the voting stock of the corporation then outstanding shall be required to alter, amend or repeal the following Articles: &#8226; Article V, which relates to composition and election of the Board, amendments of the Bylaws, and stockholder action by written consent; &#8226; Article VI, which relates to exculpation for violations of the duty of care by directors; and &#8226; Article VII, which relates to amendments of the Charter, including supermajority vote requirement for amendments to Articles V, VI, and VII. Assuming the Proposed Charter is approved by our stockholders and becomes effective: &#8226; Article V, paragraph A(3) will be amended to provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock, entitled to vote at an election directors, shall be required to remove directors without cause (the same vote currently applicable to removal for cause); &#8226; Article V, paragraph B(1) will be amended to provide that amendments to the Bylaws will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock, entitled to vote thereon; and &#8226; Article VII, paragraph B will be eliminated, such that amendments to Articles V, VI, and VII of the Charter will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock, entitled to vote thereon. In addition, once effective, the Proposed Charter would eliminate inoperative provisions relating to a previously effected forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, as well as implement other non-substantive clarifying changes. Recommendation of the Board The Board recommends that you vote&#8239; FOR &#8239;the approval of the Proposed Charter. 67 Table of Contents Effective Date of Proposed Charter If our stockholders adopt and approve this Proposal 4, we anticipate that the Proposed Charter will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and become effective on or around July 1, 2025. Reservation of Rights Our Board reserves the right to decide, in its sole discretion, not proceed with and abandon the filing of the Proposed Charter without further action by our stockholders at any time before the effectiveness of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, even if this Proposal 4 is adopted and approved by our stockholders at the 2025 Meeting. If the Board determines to exercise this discretion, we will publicly disclose this fact and the reasons for such determination. 68 Table of Contents Stockholder Proposals We will promptly furnish the address and, to our knowledge, the number of shares held by the stockholder proponents of the proposals below upon receipt of a request to our Secretary for such information at email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com or by phone at: (408) 486-2000. Proposal 5&#8212;Stockholder Proposal: Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement What am I voting on? A stockholder proposal to eliminate the one-year holding period requirement to call a special stockholder meeting. Vote required: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. Effect of broker non-votes: None. Below is a stockholder proposal and supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board accept no responsibility. This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly presented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 5. John Chevedden has notified us of his intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 Meeting. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement Proposal 5 &#8211; Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement Shareholders ask our Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to remove the current provision that considers the voice of certain NVDA shareholders as non-shareholders. Currently all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year are considered non-shareholders if they seek to call for a special shareholder meeting on an important matter. The current exclusion of all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year makes the current so-called shareholder right to call for a special shareholder meeting useless. There is no point to have a useless right on the books of NVDA. The reason to enable all shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting is to allow one shareholder or a group of shareholders to quickly acquire NVDA shares to equal the challenging 15% share ownership requirement, based on all shares outstanding, to call for a special shareholder meeting to incentivize a turnaround of NVDA should NVDA find itself in a slump in the future. The best strategies for turning around a company do not necessarily come from a company&#8217;s existing shareholders. If NVDA finds itself in a future slump, NVDA shareholders and potential NVDA shareholders will not even consider acquiring more shares in order to call for a special shareholder meeting, if they have to wait one-year to call for a special shareholder meeting. A one-year holding period makes no sense. A slumping stock price demands an immediate response. The fact that one shareholder or a group of shareholders can quickly acquire more shares to call for a special shareholder meeting is an incentive for NVDA Directors to avoid a slump in the first place since the continued service of the least qualified NVDA Directors could be terminated by a special shareholder meeting. This is a good incentive for the NVDA Directors to have for the benefit of all NVDA shareholders. At minimum this proposal alerts shareholders to the severe limitation, to the point of uselessness, baked into the current NVDA rules for shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting. Please vote yes: Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement &#8211; Proposal 5 69 Table of Contents Opposing Statement of the Board Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 5 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders. We already provide a meaningful and balanced special meeting right. Our Board recognizes the importance of allowing stockholders to call special meetings when needed. In 2024, we amended our Bylaws to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares for a minimum of one year request a special meeting. Since then, we&#8217;ve engaged with many of our largest stockholders and none raised concerns about the one-year holding period. Removing this requirement could allow a minority of stockholders who have not held a financial stake in NVIDIA for a meaningful period of time to call special meetings and waste NVIDIA&#8217;s resources, ultimately harming our stockholders. The current special meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting NVIDIA and its stockholders from narrow, short-term interests. Special meetings demand substantial time, effort, and management resources, and our one-year holding period is a reasonable safeguard. Given NVIDIA&#8217;s scale and broad stockholder base, calling a special meeting entails significant resource commitments. The associated legal, administrative and voting processes are time intensive and divert the Board and management from core business operations, potentially impacting stockholder value. Therefore, the Board believes special meetings should be limited to urgent, extraordinary matters initiated by stockholders with a substantial, long-term financial interest in the company. The one-year holding period is consistent with the SEC&#8217;s minimum for stockholders to include a proposal in our proxy statement. SEC Rule 14a-8 permits stockholders to include proposals in a company&#8217;s proxy statement after holding shares for at least one year, reflecting the principle that proponents should have an economic stake for a meaningful time period before using company and stockholder resources. This same rationale underpins our one-year holding requirement for requesting special meetings. Moreover, under Rule 14a-8, stockholders with minimal holdings may still submit proposals for annual meetings. We are committed to strong governance and stockholder accountability. The Board is committed to best practices and regularly updates its policies based on evolving standards and stockholder input. These efforts, along with the right to call special meetings, reflect our commitment to effective oversight and engagement: &#8226; Active Stockholder Engagement. We engage stockholders year-round on governance, sustainability, risk oversight, and compensation. &#8226; Annual Elections and Majority Voting. Directors are elected annually and must receive majority support under our Bylaws. &#8226; Meaningful Stockholder Rights. We offer proxy access, director nomination rights, and do not maintain a stockholder rights plan. &#8226; Independent, Refreshed Board. 92% of our directors are independent, including our Lead Director and all committee members; and four new directors have joined since 2020. &#8226; Responsive Governance Reforms. Following stockholder approval, we plan to implement the removal of supermajority voting provisions. Our Board believes the current special meeting right, including the one-year holding requirement, is appropriate. Proposal 5 is viewed as unnecessary, potentially disruptive, and not in the best interests of NVIDIA or its stockholders. Recommendation of the Board Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 5&#8212;Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement. 70 Table of Contents Proposal 6&#8212;Stockholder Proposal: Director Election Resignation Governance Policy What am I voting on? A stockholder proposal to request the adoption of a new director election resignation policy. Vote required: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. Effect of broker non-votes: None. Below is a stockholder proposal and supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board accept no responsibility. This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly presented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 6. The New York City Carpenters Pension Fund has notified us of its intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 Meeting. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement&#8239; Proposal 6 &#8211; Director Election Resignation Governance Policy Resolved: The shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation ("Company") request that the Board adopt a new Director Election Resignation Governance Policy ("Resignation Policy") provision in its corporate governance principles to address those situations when one or more incumbent Board nominees fail to receive the required majority vote for re-election. The Resignation Policy shall provide that each director upon joining the Board tender an irrevocable resignation conditioned on the director's failure to receive the required majority vote support in an uncontested election. The Resignation Policy shall provide that the Board should accept a director's tendered resignation absent its finding of a compelling reason or reasons to reject the resignation, as decided by the Board in the exercise of its business judgment. The Resignation Policy shall further stipulate that if the Board rejects a director's resignation and the director remains on the Board as a "holdover" director but is not re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that such director's second tendered resignation shall be effective ninety days after the vote certification. Supporting Statement: The Resignation Policy sets a new demanding director resignation governance guideline to reflect shareholder voting sentiment in director elections. Delaware corporate law states that each director shall hold office until such director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal. An incumbent director who does not receive the required vote for election may continue to serve as a "holdover" director. The Company's current director resignation bylaw requires incumbent directors to tender a resignation if they do not receive the requisite vote to be re-elected in an uncontested annual election. Directors on the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then review the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it. The proposed Resignation Guideline Policy sets a more demanding director resignation review process, requiring the Board to articulate a compelling reason or reasons when it rejects a tendered resignation, thus allowing an unelected director to continue to serve. Importantly, the Resignation Policy further establishes that if a "holdover" director again fails to be re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, the new resignation is effective ninety days following the election vote certification. While the Guideline Resignation Policy provides the Board latitude to reject the first resignation of an incumbent director who does not receive majority vote support, it honors the shareholder vote as the final word on a "holdover" director's second election defeat. Shareholder director election voting rights under Delaware corporate law are foundational rights in the governance of corporations. The majority vote director election standard adopted by the Company gives shareholders voting rights that have legal effect. It is important that corporate director resignation policies, guidelines and bylaws not undermine shareholder voting rights. The proposed Resignation Policy establishes shareholder voting in director elections as a more consequential governance right, striking a proper balance between board discretion and shareholder voting rights. 71 Table of Contents Opposing Statement of the Board Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 6 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.&#8239;&#8239; Our Bylaws and governance policies already provide an effective remedy for nominees not receiving a majority vote. Directors who do not receive majority support must offer their resignation, which the NCGC reviews and then recommends to the Board. The Board must act on the recommendation within 90 days, publicly disclosing its decision and reasoning. This process allows the Board to consider all factors in determining what is best for NVIDIA and its stockholders, ensuring appropriate discretion and judgment. The proposal would unduly restrict and undermine the role of the Board in exercising its judgment. Proposal 6 requires automatic resignation if a director fails to receive majority support for two consecutive years. This would undermine the Board&#8217;s ability to make informed decisions, regardless of circumstances. No other major U.S. company has adopted the policy requested in the Proposal, and such a policy is out of step with market practice. Our current policies provide for the Board to engage with stockholders and apply reasoned judgment to evaluate next steps. This measured approach ensures stability and continuity, avoiding disruptions to the Board&#8217;s functions while respecting stockholder input. Our stockholders have consistently shown strong support for our director nominees. Stockholders consistently support NVIDIA&#8217;s director nominees, as shown by high vote percentages and positive feedback during annual meetings and outreach. In the past ten years, nominees have averaged 97.2% support. NVIDIA&#8217;s robust stockholder engagement program allows for ongoing dialogue, ensuring the Board is aware of stockholder views. Our corporate governance policies ensure Board accountability and responsiveness to stockholder concerns. Our governance practices, including regular stockholder outreach, annual director elections, and independent board leadership, already ensure accountability and responsiveness. In addition, the Board has taken steps to continue board refreshment, support elimination of supermajority voting provisions (Proposal 4), and maintain a market-standard proxy access bylaw provision. The Board believes that Proposal 6&#8217;s restrictive provisions are unnecessary, potentially harmful, and not in the best interests of NVIDIA and its stockholders. Recommendation of the Board Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 6&#8212;Director Election Resignation Governance Policy. 72 Table of Contents Proposal 7&#8212;Stockholder Proposal: Workforce Data Reporting What am I voting on? A stockholder proposal to request workforce public reporting to include EEOC job categories. Vote required: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. Effect of broker non-votes: None. Below is a stockholder proposal and supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board accept no responsibility. This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly presented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 7. Trillium ESG Global Equity Fund has notified us of its intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 Meeting. Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement&#8239; Proposal 7 &#8211; Workforce Data Reporting RESOLVED: Shareholders request that NVIDIA Corporation enhance existing public reporting, at reasonable cost and omitting confidential information, to include a chart identifying employees according to gender and race in each of the nine Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)-defined job categories, listing either numbers or percentages in each category. WHEREAS: As of the filing date of this shareholder proposal, NVIDIA has decreased its workforce data transparency from previous years, which may prevent investors from assessing its workforce trends or efficacy of workplace culture and talent management programs. For example, NVIDIA consistently disclosed EEO-1 data between 2018 through 2021 but has seemingly reversed course and has not disclosed data from 2022 through the present. Market standards and stakeholder expectations, however, have significantly changed around such disclosures. As of April 2024, over 80 percent of the S&amp;P 500 and nearly 50 percent of the Russell 1000 Index companies disclose EEO-1 data, establishing this as best practice in workforce data reporting. 1 NVIDIA&#8217;s change in practice has furthermore led to it lagging peers in disclosures. In comparison to NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm release EEO-1 data. Investors need annual disclosure of granular workforce data to determine whether investments in workplace culture and talent management programs have translated to measurable impacts at various levels of the company. The comprehensive, consistent, and standardized nature of EEO-1 data disclosure also facilitates comparison across firms. As NVIDIA is required to report EEO-1 data to the federal government, it is able to provide a more complete picture of its workforce without additional burdens on the company to collect data. Workplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company&#8217;s talent attraction and retention pipeline, which may affect both social equality and financial performance. 2 As You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital reviewed the workforce diversity of 1,641 companies between 2016-2021, finding statistically significant positive correlations between manager diversity and return on equity, return on invested capital, and 10-year revenue growth, among other indicators. 3 Implementing more robust reporting via the disclosure of EEO-1 data would provide transparency and insight to investors, employees, and stakeholders. Further, comparing the data collected to internal and external standards and peers may enhance talent management, workplace culture strategy, and promote employee retention. Subsequent disclosures around these activities would enable investors to better understand and assess NVIDIA&#8217;s human capital management trends and performance. 1 https://diversiq.com/blog/whats-new-this-proxy-season-trends-at-the-halfway-point/ 2 https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-are-important-to-workers-survey-shows.html 3 https://www.asyousow.org/report-page/2023-capturing-the-diversity-benefit 73 Table of Contents Opposing Statement of the Board Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 7 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders. We publish robust workforce and diversity data. The Board agrees that &#8220;workplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company&#8217;s talent attraction and retention pipeline,&#8221; and believes our employees are our greatest asset. Consequently, the Board has long supported NVIDIA&#8217;s human capital programs and extensive workforce-related disclosures. For example, NVIDIA&#8217;s 2024 Sustainability Report contains: &#8226; Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 workforce data on geographic regions, employee type, age, gender, positions held by women, and race/ethnicity (U.S.), disability, and veterans. &#8226; Detailed hiring data by age, gender, region, and race/ethnicity (U.S.). &#8226; Pay ratios of women to men, Asian to White, Black/African American to White, and Hispanic/Latino to White, along with annual turnover rate statistics by gender and race/ethnicity (U.S.). &#8226; Expansive discussions of NVIDIA&#8217;s workforce initiatives, such as community resource groups, learning and development programs, employee engagement, mentorship, and our benefits and compensation programs. The Board is proud of NVIDIA&#8217;s human capital accomplishments and the success of our employees in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. For example, NVIDIA continues to be among America&#8217;s best places to work, ranking fourth on Glassdoor&#8217;s list of best employers for 2025. We believe the requested disclosures are not suited to our business. Proposal 7 suggests our reporting is deficient because we have not tailored our workforce disclosure to report on gender and race according to the specific job categories used by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for EEO-1 Component 1 reporting. These nine broadly defined roles, including &#8220;first/mid-level officials and managers,&#8221; &#8220;craft workers,&#8221; &#8220;operatives,&#8221; and &#8220;laborers and helpers,&#8221; are generic categories applicable to all business types across the U.S. For example, the &#8220;operative&#8221; category includes jobs as diverse as laundry workers, weaving machine operators, bakers, and poultry and fish processing workers. These categories are designed for employers with more than 100 employees and are not suited for describing NVIDIA&#8217;s workforce. Publishing data based on generic categories is uninformative and may create confusion regarding our workforce, operations, and human capital practices. Our workforce disclosures are used by our stockholders and other stakeholders as an important tool for understanding our business. We take great care in selecting and preparing the most relevant and useful data for these audiences. The Board believes our stockholders are best served by publishing workforce disclosures based on metrics and categories most relevant to our business and stakeholders, such as the detailed datapoints in our sustainability reports. Our management is well-positioned to determine the most appropriate workforce reporting metrics. The Board believes NVIDIA&#8217;s management, supported by our Corporate Sustainability team and overseen by the CC and NCGC, as applicable, is best positioned to assess the most appropriate workforce metrics to be published. In 2024, NVIDIA launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee of our executives to oversee our Corporate Sustainability team and guide our sustainability strategy and program, in collaboration with the Board and NCGC. The Corporate Sustainability team designs and implements NVIDIA&#8217;s extensive public disclosures, including NVIDIA&#8217;s annual sustainability report, which is guided by leading disclosure frameworks. The Corporate Sustainability team strives to incorporate stockholder feedback and conducts regular outreach to solicit input and provide updates on progress. Given management&#8217;s awareness of stockholder priorities and understanding of our business and workforce, the Board believes Proposal 7&#8217;s imposition of potentially misleading reporting requirements is inappropriate and unhelpful to our stockholders and other stakeholders. Recommendation of the Board Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 7&#8212;Workforce Data Reporting. 74 Table of Contents Equity Compensation Plan Information The number of shares that were issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs and PSUs, and the number of shares that remained available for future issuance, under each of our equity compensation plans as of January&#160;26, 2025, are summarized below.

The name of this corporation is NVIDIA Corporation. II. The address of the registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is 251 Little Falls Drive, City of Wilmington, County of New Castle 19808, and the name of the registered agent of the corporation in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service Company. I ll. The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. IV. A. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, &#8220;Common Stock&#8221; and &#8220;Preferred Stock.&#8221; The total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is Eighty Billion Two Million (80,002,000,000) shares. Eighty Billion (80,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). Two Million (2,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically subdivided and reclassified into ten (10) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, without any further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof (the &#8220;Stock Split&#8221;). Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock shall thereafter represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Common Stock represented by such certificate shall have been subdivided and reclassified pursuant to the Stock Split. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, by filing a certificate (a &#8220;Preferred Stock Designation&#8221;) pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, to fix or alter from time to time the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to establish from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. V. For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the C c orporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the C c orporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that: A. 1. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the C c orporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. 2. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Board of Directors is and shall remain divided into three classes, with the directors in each class serving for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders held after their election. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the terms of the members of the Board of Directors shall be as follows: (i) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or such directors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013; (ii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or such directors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014; and (iii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014 and at each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. The classification of the Board of Directors shall terminate at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014 and all directors shall be elected in accordance with clause (iii) above. A-1 Table of Contents Each Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 3. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed from office at any time (i) with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the C c orporation, entitled to vote at an election of directors (the "Voting Stock") or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock . 4. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders.
