Firmwide expenses reflect our ongoing progress in funding growth through disciplined expense management.” Dimon added that the firm is on target to comp lete the New York Tri- State retail conversion during the third quarter of this year, noting that “customers are already seeing the benefits of refurbished branches, more ATMs and upgraded sy stems. Once this conversion is complete, we will redirect resources to converting The Bank of New York branches that we are acquiring.

Earnings growth reflected strong Fixed Income Markets results and reco rd investment banking fees, partially offset by higher performance-base d compensation and a reduced benefit from the provision for credit losses. Compared with th e prior quarter, net inco me was down slightly, reflecting lower revenue, primarily related to lo wer Equity Markets resu lts, offset by reduced expenses and a benefit from the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $4.2 billion, up by $1.4 billion, or 52%, from the prio r year, and down 11% from the record results in the prior quarter. Investment banking fees of $1.4 billion were a record, up 42% from the prior year, driven by record fees in both equity and debt underwriting. Advisory fees of $352 million were flat compared with strong performan ce in the prior year. Debt underwriting fees of $652 million were up 30% driven by record bond underwriting fees, partially offset by lower loan syndication fees. Equity underwriting fees of $364 million were up by $260 million, reflecting strong performance acr oss all regions. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $2.0 billion was up 43% due to stronger performance across essentially all products. Equity Markets revenue of $528 million improved from a weak prior-yea r quarter, reflecting strength in equity commissions. Credit Portfolio revenue of $251 million was down 15%, primarily reflecting lower gains from loan workouts and loan sales. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $62 million, as compared with a benefit of $343 million in the prior year and a $183 million cost in the prior quarter. The $62 million benefit reflects portfolio activity and stable credit quality. Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 35% from the prior year, primarily due to higher performance-based compensation. Compared w ith the prior quarter, noninterest expense was down 8%, benefiting from lower performance-based compensation and lower incremental expense related to SFAS 123R. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

RETAIL FINANCIAL SERVICES (RFS) Results for RFS 1Q06 2Q05 ($ millions) 2Q06 1Q06 2Q05 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net Revenue $3,779 $3,763 $3,799 $16 --% ($20) (1%) Provision for Credit Losses 100 85 94 15 18 6 6 Noninterest Expense 2,259 2,238 2,126 21 1 133 6 Net Income $868 $881 $980 ($13) (1%) ($112) (11%) Discussion of Results: Net income of $868 million was down by $112 million, or 11%, from the prior year. The decrease reflected a $131 million reduction in Mort gage Banking offset partially by growth in Regional Banking and in Auto Finance. Compar ed with the prior quarter, which included the benefit from the seasonal tax-refund anticipation business, net income was down slightly. Net revenue decreased slightly to $3.8 billion compared with the prior year. Net interest income of $2.6 billion was flat, as the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances in Regional Banking was offset by narrower spreads earned on loans and deposits in Regional Banking and Mortgage Banking, as well as by lower auto loan and lease balances. Noni nterest revenue of $1.2 billion was down by $28 million, or 2%, driven by lower MSR risk management results in Mortgage Banking, which were down by $222 million compared with the prior year. This decrease was offset primarily by increases in Regional Banki ng fee income, mortgage production revenue and automobile operating lease income. The provision for credit losses totaled $100 m illion, up by $6 million from the prior year, reflecting higher loan balances in Regional Banking. Credit tr ends were stable across all businesses. Noninterest expense of $2.3 billion increased by $133 million, or 6%, a result of ongoing investments in the retail distribution network, the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services late in the first quarter of 2006, and higher depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. These increases were partially offset by merger-related and other operating efficiencies. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 Regional Banking net income totaled $764 million, up by $2 million from the prior year. Net revenue of $3.1 billion increased by $111 million, or 4%. Results reflected growth in deposits, home equity and mortgage loans, as well as higher deposit-related fees and credit card sales. These increases were offset partially by narrower spreads earned on loans and deposits. While credit tr ends were stable, the provision for credit losses of $70 million increased by $7 million, or 11%, due to higher loan balances. Expenses of $1.7 billion were up by $85 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The increase was due to investments in the retail distribution network and the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services in the first quarter, partiall y offset by merger savings and operating efficiencies. Compared with the prior quarter, which included the benefit from the seasonal tax-refund anticipation business, net income was up 1%. Highlights Include:  Checking accounts grew by 136,000 to 9.1 million during the quarter and were up by 568,000 from the prior year.  Average total deposits incr eased to $187.8 billion, up 7% from the prior year and up 2% from the prior quarter.

Mortgage Banking net loss was $7 million, compar ed with net income of $124 million in the prior year. Net revenu e was $318 million, down by $186 million from the prior year. Revenue comprises produc tion revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue was $202 m illion, up by $58 million, reflecting higher gain-on-sale margins. Net mortgage servicing revenue was $116 million, down by $244 million from the prior year. This decl ine was primarily related to: MSR risk management revenue of negative $55 milli on (including $38 million in losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities) , down by $222 million from the prior year, reflecting a fully hedged position during th e current quarter; a decline of $68 million in other changes in MSR fair value; and an increase in loan serv icing revenue of $46 million on a 14% increase in third-party lo ans serviced. Noninterest expense was $329 million, up by $23 million, or 8%. Highlights Include:  Mortgage loan originations of $36.5 bill ion were up 17% from the prior year and up 26% from the prior quarter.  Total third-party mortgage loans servic ed were $497 billion, an increase of $59 billion, or 14%, from the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 Auto Finance net income of $111 million was up by $17 million, or 18%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by wider loan spreads on lower loan and lease balances. After adjusting for the impact of increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases, e xpenses were down slightly as operating efficiencies offset increased costs related to higher production volumes. Highlights Include:  Average loan receivables were $40.3 billion, down by $6.7 billion, or 14%, from the prior year and down by $0.9 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter.  Average lease-related assets of $4.4 billion declined by $2.5 billion, or 36%.  The net charge-off rate was 0.43% compared with 0.37% in the prior year. CARD SERVICES (CS) Results for CS(a) 1Q06 2Q05 ($ millions) 2Q06 1Q06 2Q05 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net Revenue $3,664 $3,685 $3,886 ($21) (1%) ($222) (6%) Provision for Credit Losses 1,031 1,016 1,641 15 1 (610) (37) Noninterest Expense 1,249 1,243 1,383 6 -- (134) (10) Net Income $875 $901 $542 ($26) (3%) $333 61% (a) As a result of the integration of the Chase Merchant Services and Paymentech merchant processing businesses into a joint ve nture, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, net revenue, noninterest expense an d pre-tax income have been redu ced to reflect the deconsolida tion of Paymentech (no periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 have been adjusted to reflect the d econsolidation). The deconsolida tion of Paymentech has no impact on net income. Discussion of Results: Net income of $875 million was up by $333 million, or 61%, from the prior year. Results were driven by a lower provision for credit losses, due to significantly lower bankruptcy filings and the release of $90 million of provision related to Hurricane Katrina. To illustrate underlying business tr ends, the following discussion of Card Services’ performance assumes for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2005 that the deconso lidation of Paymentech had occurred as of the first quarter 2005. The eff ect of the deconsolidation would have reduced net managed revenue, primarily noninterest r evenue, and noninterest expense, but would not have had any impact on net income for such periods. End-of-period managed loans of $139.3 billion incr eased by $2.0 billion, or 1%, from the prior year and by $5.0 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans of $137.2 billion increased by $2.0 billion, or 1%, from the prio r year, but decreased $836 million, or 1%, from the prior quarter. The current quarter include d average managed and end-of-period managed loans of $2.1 billion from the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business (acquired in the fourth quarter of 2005), as well as $1.2 bil lion of average managed loans and $1.6 billion of end-of-period managed loans from the acquisition, in the current quarter, of the Kohl’s private label portfolio. Compared with the prior year, both average managed and end-of-period managed loans were negatively affected by hi gher customer payment rates. Management believes that contributing to the higher payment rates are the new minimum payment rules and a higher proportion of customers in rewards-based programs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Net managed revenue was $3.7 billion, down by $76 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $3.0 b illion was down slightly from the prior year. The primary driver was narrower spreads on loans as the managed net interest margin of 8.66% was down from 8.83% in the prior year, offset partially by a 1% increase in average managed loan balances from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $702 million was down by $66 million, or 9%, due to higher volume-driven payments to partners, higher e xpense related to reward programs and lower securitization gains, partially offset by increased interchange income related to a 12% increase in charge volume. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 0 billion, down by $610 million, or 37%, from the prior year. This decrease was due to lower bankruptcy-rela ted losses, strong underlying credit quality, and the release of $90 million of provision relating to Hurricane Katrina. Compared with the prior quarter, the manage d provision for credit losses increased by $15 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher bankruptcy-related charge-offs, partially offset by the release of provision relating to Hurricane Katrina. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter decreased to 3.28%, down from 4.87% in the prior year and up from 2.99% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.14%, down from 3.34% in the prior year and up from 3.10% in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was flat fr om the prior year. Merger savings, other efficiencies and the absence of a litigation charge incurred in th e prior year were offset by the acquisition of the Sears Canada credit card business and Kohl’s private label portfolio, higher marketing spending and by increased fraud-related losses. Highlights Include:  Pre-tax income to average managed loans (ROO) was 4.05%, up from 2.56% in the prior year, but down from 4.19% in the prior quarter.  Net interest income as a percentage of average managed loans was 8.66%, down from 8.83% in the prior year and 8.85% in the prior quarter.  Net accounts opened during the second quarter were 24.6 million, including 21 million accounts from the Kohl’s acquisition.  Charge volume of $84.4 billion increas ed by $8.8 billion, or 12%, from the prior year.  Merchant processing volume of $166.3 bi llion increased by $25.1 billion, or 18%, and total transactions of 4.5 b illion increased by 672 million, or 18%, from the prior year.  Signed three new relationships with busin ess card and affinity group partners and renewed partner relationships including AOL, LLC and Countrywide Financial.  Completed the acquisition of the Kohl ’s private label portfolio with $1.6 billion of receivables and 21 million accounts on April 21.

Net revenue was a record $1.6 billion, up by $171 million, or 12%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.0 billion, up by $96 million, or 10%. The improvement was due primarily to an increase in assets under custody to $11.5 trillion, which was driven by market value appreciation and new business. Also contributing to the improvement was growth in foreign exchange, securities lending and ADRs, all of which were driven by a combination of increased product usage by existing clients and ne w business.

News Release 11 revenue was $289 million compared with $407 million, reflecting $492 million of securities losses in Treasury compared with gains of $6 million; higher Private Equity gains of $549 million compared with gains of $300 million; and a gain in the current quarter of $103 million related to the sale of MasterCard shares in its initial public offering. Noninterest expense was $155 million, down by $2.5 b illion from $2.6 billion in the prior year and down by $177 million from the prior quarter. Insurance recoveries relating to certain material litigation were $260 million in the curre nt period and $98 million in the prior quarter, while the prior year resu lts included a material litigation charge of $1.9 b illion. Merger costs of $86 million were incurred in the current quart er, $71 million in the prior quarter and $279 million in the prior year. Excluding all of thes e items, noninterest expenses would have been down by $152 million compared with the prior year and down by $30 million from the prior quarter. These decreases were due to merger-related savings and other operating efficiencies. On April 8, 2006, the firm announced the excha nge of select Corporate Trust businesses, including trustee, paying agent, loan agen cy services and document management, for the consumer, small business and middle market banking businesses of The Bank of New York. These Corporate Trust businesses, which were previously reported in Treasury & Securities Services, have been deemed discontinued opera tions. The related balance sheet and income statement activity is reflected in the Corporat e segment for all periods presented. During the current quarter, these businesses produced $56 milli on in net income compared with net income of $57 million in the prior year. Highlights Include:  Private Equity portfolio was $5.6 bil lion, down from $6.4 billion in the prior year and down from $6.3 billion in the prior quarter. The portfolio represented 8.3% of stockholders’ equity less goodw ill, down from 10.3% in the prior year and 9.7% in the prior quarter.

These Corporate Trust businesses, whic h were previously reported in Treasury & Secur ities Services, have been deemed discontinued ope rations. The related balance sheet and income statement activity has been transferred to the Corporate segment for all periods presented. (b) Presented on a managed basis see Note 1 (Page 13) for further explanation of managed basis. Discussion of Results:(see notes (a) (b) above) Net income was a record $3.5 billion, up by $2.5 billion, compared with $994 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher managed revenue; lower expenses, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 benefited from the absence of a $1.9 billion materi al litigation charge in the prior year; and a lower managed provision for credit losses. Net managed revenue was $15.7 billion, up by $2.0 b illion, or 15%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.0 billion was up by $2.0 billion, or 28%, primarily due to the following: higher principal transactions revenu e; increased asset management, administration and commissions revenue; and higher investment ba nking fees. Partially offsetting this growth were higher securities losses primarily in the Co rporate segment, lower Mortgage Banking risk management results, and the deconsolidation of Paymentech. Net interest income was $6.7 billion, up by $49 million, or 1%, due to an improve ment in the Corporate segment’s net interest spread, higher balances related to consumer deposits and wholesal e loans, and wider spreads on higher wholesale liability balances. This increa se was offset partially by narrower spreads on trading-related assets, consumer loans and consumer deposits. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 1 billion, down by $463 million, or 31%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for cr edit losses was a benefit of $77 million for the quarter compared with a benefit of $218 milli on in the prior year. The $77 million benefit reflects portfolio activity and stab le credit. The wholesale loan net recovery rate was 0.05% for the quarter, compared with a net recovery rate of 0.16% in the prior year. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $1.1 b illion, $604 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower bankruptcy-related net charge-offs and the release of $90 million of provision relating to Hurricane Ka trina in Card Services. Th e firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.4 billion at June 30, 2006, down by $448 million, or 16%, from the prior-year level of $2.8 billion. Noninterest expense was $9.2 billion, down by $1.6 billion, or 14%, from the prior year. Excluding in the current ye ar, insurance recoveries relating to certain ma terial litigation of $260 million, incremental expense of $106 million from SFAS 123R and $86 milli on of merger costs, and excluding in the prior year, a material li tigation charge of $1.9 billion and $279 million of merger costs, noninterest expense would have been up by $657 million. The increase was driven by higher performance-based compensation and acquisitions , offset partially by the deconsolidation of Paymentech and operating efficiencies. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.5% at June 30, 2006 (estimated), 8.5% at March 31, 2006, and 8.2% at June 30, 2005.  During the quarter, $746 million of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 17.7 million shares purchased at an average price of $42.24 per share. Year-to-date, $2.0 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 49.5 million shares purchased at an average price of $41.14 per share.  As of June 30, 2006, a total of $888 million, or 21.1 million shares, have been purchased under the $8 billion share purchase program approved on March 21, 2006.  Headcount of 172,423 increased by 1,636 since March 31, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Merger and other financial information • Merger savings and cost: For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, approximately $610 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualized rate of $2.4 billion. Management estimates that annualized savings will be approximately $2.8 billion by the end of 2006. Management continues to estimate that annual merger savings of approximately $3.0 billion will be achieved. Merger costs of $86 million were expensed during the second quarter of 2006, bringing the total amount incurred to $3.3 billi on (including capitalized costs) since the merger announcement. Management previously estimated that total merger costs would be $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion; management currently expects total merger costs will be approximately $4.0 billion. The remaining merger costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2007. • FASB Statement No. 123R (“Share-Based Payment”): JPMorgan Chase adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), (“Share-Based Payment”) as of January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires that stock compensation granted to retirement-eligible employees be fully expensed at, or prior to, the time of grant rather than amortized over the vesting period. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarte r of 2006, the firm expensed the full amount of the compensation expense associated with grants of restrict ed stock made in January 2006 to retirement-eligible employees. In addition, during the firs t quarter of 2006, the firm began to accrue the estimated cost of grants expected to be awarded in January 2007 to retirement-eligible employees. The total incremental expense recorded in the first quarter of 2006 was $459 million. During the second quarter of 2006 incremental expense of $106 million was recorded. Awards granted to retirement-eligib le employees prior to January 1, 2006, have not been accelerated and will continue to be am ortized over the original vesting peri ods. The firm estimates that the expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R for the remaining quarters of 2006 will be approximately $110 million of incremental costs per quarter. The increm ental expenses incurred during 2006 are non-cash charges and represent accelerated recognition of costs that would have been incurred in future periods. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a report ed basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines’ of business results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and over all financial performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the cred it card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will aff ect both the loan receiva bles sold under SFAS 14 0 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed loan receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is pr esented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are pres ented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology a llows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The co rresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second quarter 2006) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pre-tax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre-tax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates the performance of TSS and AWM against that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
