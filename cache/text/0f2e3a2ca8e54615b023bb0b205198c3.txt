(&#8220;VMware&#8221;).&#160; The Term Facilities consist of a $10,695,312,500&#160;unsecured term&#160;A-2&#160;facility (the &#8220;Term&#160;A-2&#160;Facility&#8221;), a $10,695,312,500&#160;unsecured term&#160;A-3&#160;facility (the &#8220;Term&#160;A-3&#160;Facility&#8221;) and a $7,000,000,000&#160;unsecured term&#160;A-5&#160;facility (the &#8220;Term&#160;A-5&#160;Facility&#8221;).&#160; On or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) business days after the Funding Date (as defined below), the Term Facilities may be increased (a &#8220;Term Loan Increase&#8221;) by up to $2,000,000,000, with any such increase allocated among the (and having terms identical to the applicable) Term Facilities as agreed by Broadcom and any lender providing such additional commitments.&#160; The obligations of Broadcom under the Credit Agreement are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of Broadcom&#8217;s subsidiaries. &#160; The availability of the term loans under the Credit Agreement, which have not yet been funded, is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein, including that the Funding Date has occurred on or prior to the earliest of (A) the date that is five (5) business days after the later of (x) the Outside Date (as defined in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 26, 2022, by and among Broadcom, VMware, Verona Holdco, Inc., Verona Merger Sub, Inc., Barcelona Merger Sub 2, Inc. and Barcelona Merger Sub 3, LLC (as in effect on May 26, 2022, the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;)) and (y) in the event Broadcom shall have made the election contemplated by and in accordance with Section 2.2 of the Merger Agreement, the date by which the Acquisition is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Merger Agreement after giving effect to such election, (B) the date of consummation of the Acquisition without the funding of any term loans under the Credit Agreement, (C) the date of the termination of the Merger Agreement by Broadcom in writing in accordance with its terms and (D) the date, if any, that Broadcom elects to terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement.&#160;

Voluntary prepayments of the term loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty among the Term Facilities as selected by Broadcom in its sole discretion, subject to certain conditions pertaining to minimum notice and minimum reduction amounts as described in the Credit Agreement. &#160;
