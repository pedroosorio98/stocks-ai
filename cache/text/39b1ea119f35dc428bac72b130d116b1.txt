We supported the COVID-19 public health response, delivered new innovative tools, and adapted our business to empower people with the information and technology they needed most. &nbsp; Our Communities &nbsp; We made significant contributions toward relief efforts supporting healthcare professionals, first responders, and impacted communities worldwide. This included sourcing 30 million masks and 10 million custom-built face shields, and matching our employees&#146; charitable donations. Additionally, we invested to help scale the production of COVID-19 sample collection kits for hospitals across the United States. And we collaborated to create a new exposure notifications system for governments and health agencies, with user privacy and security central to its design. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A healthcare worker in Zambia wears an Apple-produced face shield. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Our Customers &nbsp; We brought our most powerful ever generation of hardware, software, and services into customers&#146; hands, helping them stay safe, connected, and entertained. We also tailored our services to promote easy access to trusted information on COVID-19: launching a new section on Apple News; prioritizing visibility of essential services locations on Apple Maps; and offering a curated collection of telehealth apps on the App Store. To meet the extraordinary challenges of virtual education, we delivered new content and services for students, parents, and teachers to foster creativity and learning in a digital environment, and worked with mobile carriers and school administrators to deliver iPads with LTE support to students in need. &nbsp; Our Teams and Business Partners &nbsp; Apple was one of the first major companies to lead the COVID-19 response, temporarily closing our retail stores and moving to flexible work arrangements for our corporate offices globally. We have continued to pay our teams during temporary store and office closures; expanded our paid leave policies; provided team members with personal protective equipment; and established policies and procedures for a safe work environment. Together with our suppliers, we also implemented new health and safety procedures for supplier workforces, and worked to support our suppliers&#146; ability to pay their hourly workers. And we have further supported our business partners by accelerating our payments to suppliers and extending payment and credit terms for our resellers.

Advancing&nbsp;Inclusion,&nbsp;Diversity,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Racial&nbsp;Justice We recognize that much more work is needed to advance inclusion, diversity, and racial justice both within our company and externally, and to this work, we are deeply committed. Internally, we further sharpened our focus on hiring inclusively, providing greater growth and development opportunities, and expanding our diversity network associations so that everyone at Apple can feel that they belong. Externally, beginning in the United States, we announced a $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exist for communities of color, with a focus on education, economic equality, and criminal justice reform, particularly in Black communities. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Montague wind farm in Oregon is one of Apple&#146;s largest projects at 200 megawatts and powers Apple&#146;s Prineville data center. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Protecting&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Shared Planet &nbsp; Apple&#146;s innovation and passion to change the world led to one of our most significant environmental commitments yet. This year we unveiled an ambitious roadmap to become carbon neutral across our entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. We are already carbon neutral for our corporate emissions&#151;resulting from our use of 100&nbsp;percent renewable electricity for our facilities and investing in high-quality projects that protect and restore forests, wetlands, and grasslands. &nbsp; &nbsp; Investing in Our Communities &nbsp; Apple serves communities around the world, investing in causes that reflect our values and belief that we need to leave the world better than we found it.

From collaborating with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs nationally on innovative new workforce development programs to establishing or expanding our partnerships with 36 Historically Black Colleges and Universities&#151;10 of which were added as regional coding centers to serve as technology hubs&#151;we brought coding, creativity, and workforce development opportunities to communities traditionally underrepresented in technology. &nbsp;&nbsp; Affordable housing project in San Jose, California. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 5 Table of Contents &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 6 Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp; Proxy Statement Summary This summary highlights the proposals to be acted upon, as well as selected executive compensation and corporate governance information described in more detail in this Proxy Statement. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 7 Table of Contents &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 8 Table of Contents Annual Meeting 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders &nbsp; Virtual Meeting Site: &nbsp;&nbsp; February 23, 2021 www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AAPL2021 &nbsp;&nbsp; 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time The Record Date for the Annual Meeting is December 28, 2020.

Consistent with this approach, our 2021 executive compensation program will reflect the following changes: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 2021 Annual Cash Incentive: Beginning in 2021, an environmental, social, and governance modifier based on Apple Values and other key community initiatives will be incorporated into our annual cash incentive program. This change will further motivate Apple&#146;s executive team to meet exceptionally high standards of values-driven leadership in addition to delivering strong financial results. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; CEO Compensation: For the first time since he was promoted to the CEO role in 2011, Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 compensation will include a long-term equity award. This award will better align the structure of his time-based and performance-based equity incentives with the awards of our other named executive officers. &nbsp; &#147;Tim has brought unparalleled innovation and focus to his role as CEO and demonstrated what it means to lead with values and integrity.

To satisfy the Board&#146;s duties, directors are expected to take a proactive, focused approach to their positions to ensure that Apple is committed to business success through the maintenance of high standards of responsibility and ethics. Apple&#146;s key governance documents, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, are available at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . The Board met four times during 2020, and each member of the Board who served during 2020 attended or participated in 75% or more of the aggregate of (i)&nbsp;the total number of meetings of the Board held during 2020, and (ii)&nbsp; the total number of meetings held by each committee of the Board on which such member served during 2020. Composition of the Board and its Committees The Board believes that its current leadership structure, in which the roles of Chairman and CEO are separated, best serves the Board&#146;s ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of Apple&#146;s shareholders, including its oversight of management, and Apple&#146;s overall corporate governance. The Board also believes that the current structure allows our CEO to focus on managing Apple, while leveraging our independent Chairman&#146;s experience to drive accountability at the Board level. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve Apple and its shareholders. The Board has determined that all Board members, other than Mr.&nbsp;Cook, are independent under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;). Apple&#146;s Board has a standing Audit and Finance Committee (the &#147;Audit Committee&#148;), Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the &#147;Nominating Committee&#148;).

The Board has retained primary oversight of certain areas of risk and management&#146;s response, including corporate and product strategy. While the Board and its committees exercise oversight of risk management, management is responsible for implementing and supervising day-to-day risk management processes and reporting to the Board and its committees. Audit Committee&#146;s Role in Oversight of Risk Management The Audit Committee is charged with the primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management. In accordance with this responsibility, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management management&#146;s program to identify, assess, monitor, manage, and mitigate Apple&#146;s significant business risks, including financial; operational; privacy; data security; business continuity; tax; legal and regulatory compliance, including antitrust compliance; and reputational risks. The Audit Committee is assisted in its risk oversight duties by a management Risk Oversight Committee, which includes among its members Apple&#146;s Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, and head of Business Assurance. The Risk Oversight Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee. Selected Areas of Audit Committee Oversight Privacy and Data Security.

These reports include, among other matters, updates on significant domestic and international tax-related developments, worldwide tax audits, international tax structure, international tax policy, and other tax-related legislative matters. Compensation Committee&#146;s Role in Oversight of Risk Management Apple&#146;s Compensation Committee has primary responsibility to oversee risks related to Apple&#146;s compensation programs. In establishing and reviewing Apple&#146;s compensation programs, the Compensation Committee evaluated whether the design and operation of Apple&#146;s compensation programs or policies encourage our executive officers or our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks. The Compensation Committee concluded that Apple&#146;s compensation programs and policies provide an effective and appropriate mix of incentives to help ensure performance is focused on long-term shareholder value creation, and do not encourage short-term risk taking at the expense of long-term results or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Apple. In making that determination, the Compensation Committee considered the program features that mitigate against potential risks for our executive officers such as: fixed base salaries; goals that are tied to specific company financial measures and payout caps for the annual cash incentive program; clawbacks for our cash and equity incentives; the quantity and mix of long-term performance-based and time-based equity incentives; and stock ownership requirements. The Compensation Committee also generally considered the program features that mitigate against potential risks for our non-executive officer employees. Nominating Committee&#146;s Role in Oversight of Risk Management Apple&#146;s Nominating Committee has the primary responsibility to oversee risks related to Board structure and composition, and corporate governance.

As an Apple employee, Mr.&nbsp;Cook, our CEO, does not receive compensation for his service as a member of the Board. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the total compensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. As part of this process, the Compensation Committee evaluates market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance&nbsp;LLC (&#147;Pay Governance&#148;), and makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee Director compensation after reviewing the Compensation Committee&#146;s recommendation. The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (&#147;Director Stock Plan&#148;) provides for an annual limit of $1.5&nbsp;million for all compensation paid to a Non-Employee Director. The compensation of our Non-Employee Directors did not change for 2020. Cash Retainers. Our Non-Employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $100,000. In 2020, the Chairman of the Board, Dr.&nbsp;Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $200,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr.&nbsp;Sugar, received an additional cash retainer of $35,000; the Chair of the Compensation Committee, Ms.&nbsp;Jung, received an additional cash retainer of $30,000; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms.&nbsp;Wagner, received an additional cash retainer of $25,000. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments. Equity-Based Awards. A substantial portion of each Non-Employee Director&#146;s annual retainer is in the form of equity awards. Under the Director Stock Plan, Non-Employee Directors are granted restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders (each, an &#147;Annual Director Award&#148;). All Annual Director Awards vest on February&nbsp;1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. For 2020, the number of RSUs underlying each Annual Director Award was determined by dividing $250,000 by the per share closing price of Apple&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. A Non-Employee Director who is newly appointed to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders will receive a grant of RSUs upon appointment (an &#147;Initial Director Award&#148;), except that a Non-Employee Director who first joins the Board on or after February&nbsp;1 of a particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year, or a director who was an employee of Apple immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, will not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based on the portion of the period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest on the next February&nbsp;1 following the grant of the award. Each RSU granted under the Director Stock Plan will be credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject to the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for such dividend. The amounts credited to each RSU are referred to as &#147;dividend equivalents.&#148; Any dividend equivalents credited to an RSU granted under the Director Stock Plan will be subject to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. The dividend equivalents are meant to treat the RSU award holders consistently with shareholders. Equipment and Matching Gifts Programs. Apple has an equipment program for the Board under which each Non-Employee Director is eligible to receive, upon request and free of charge, one of each new product introduced by Apple, and is eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Additionally, each Non-Employee Director is eligible to participate in Apple&#146;s matching gifts program to the same extent as Apple employees. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 29 Table of Contents Deferred Compensation Plan. &nbsp;We adopted the Apple Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (&#147;DCP&#148;) in 2018, effective for deferrals beginning in 2019. The DCP allows eligible participants, including our Non-Employee Directors, to defer a portion of their&nbsp;eligible compensation,&nbsp;subject to the terms of the DCP. The DCP is unfunded and unsecured. We do not provide any matching contributions under the DCP or allow for deferral of RSUs. None of our Non-Employee Directors participated in the DCP in 2020. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Apple has stock ownership guidelines for our CEO, executive officers, and Non-Employee Directors. Under the guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected, within five years after the individual first becomes subject to the guidelines, to own shares of Apple&#146;s common stock that have a value equal to five times their annual cash retainer for serving as a director. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual&#146;s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual&#146;s spouse, or the individual&#146;s children. Other than Ms. Lozano, who joined the Board in January 2021, each Non-Employee Director currently satisfies the stock ownership guidelines.

Members of the Compensation Committee Andrea Jung (Chair) | Al Gore | Art Levinson &nbsp; Compensation Discussion and Analysis We are proud of our commitment to leaving the world better than we found it, leading with values and integrity, and creating innovative products for our customers, while delivering strong financial results for our shareholders. During 2020, we supported the COVID-19 public health response by adapting our business to bring people the information and technology they needed most. We introduced powerful new hardware and software features to Apple Watch to empower our customers to take control of their health and fitness and announced the transition to Apple silicon for Mac to deliver industry-leading performance and a common architecture across all Apple products. We also achieved new all-time records for revenue&#150;$274.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and earnings per share&#150;$3.28, up 10% year-over-year; operating income grew 4% year-over-year; and we doubled our 2016 Services revenue in our June 2020 quarter, six months ahead of our goal. The 2020 compensation of our named executive officers appropriately reflects and rewards their significant contributions to Apple&#146;s strong performance in a year that presented unique and unprecedented challenges for our executive team to manage. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis explains the guiding principles and practices upon which our executive compensation program is based and the compensation paid to our named executive officers: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Tim Cook , Chief Executive Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Luca Maestri , Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Kate Adams , Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Deirdre O&#146;Brien , Senior Vice President, Retail + People &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Jeff Williams , Chief Operating Officer &nbsp; Guiding Principles Team-Based Approach. We apply a team-based approach to the compensation of our named executive officers with internal pay equity as a primary consideration. Performance Expectations. We establish clear, quantitative financial goals and values-driven performance expectations focused on Apple&#146;s overall success and impact. Emphasis on Long-Term Equity Incentives. We emphasize long-term performance, retention, and alignment between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders by significantly weighting our named executive officers&#146; compensation toward long-term equity awards. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 34 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Policies and Practices We are committed to sound executive compensation policies and practices, as highlighted in the following table. &nbsp; &nbsp; Prohibition on hedging, pledging, and short sales &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We prohibit short sales, transactions in derivatives, hedging, and pledging of Apple securities by our named executive officers. &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock ownership guidelines &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have robust stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers. &nbsp; &nbsp; Compensation clawback policy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our compensation clawback policy allows us to recover annual cash incentives, equity awards, or other amounts that may be paid in respect of awards in the event of certain acts of misconduct by our named executive officers. &nbsp; &nbsp; No repricing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not allow repricing of stock options without shareholder approval. &nbsp; &nbsp; No change of control payments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not provide change of control payments or gross-ups of related excise taxes. &nbsp; &nbsp; Vesting requirements for dividend equivalents &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We apply the same vesting restrictions and performance conditions on dividend equivalents as on the underlying RSUs. &nbsp; &nbsp; At-will employment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We employ our named executive officers at will. &nbsp; &nbsp; No pension or other special benefits &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not provide pensions or supplemental executive health or insurance benefits. &nbsp; &nbsp; No significant perquisites &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not provide significant perquisites to our named executive officers. For security and efficiency purposes, Mr.&nbsp;Cook is provided personal security services and is required by the Board to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. &nbsp; &nbsp; Annual compensation risk assessment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Compensation Committee conducts an annual risk assessment of our compensation program. &nbsp; &nbsp; Independent compensation consultant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Compensation Committee has directly retained an independent compensation consultant that performs no services for Apple other than services for the Compensation Committee. &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 35 Table of Contents Compensation Committee Judgment and Discretion The Compensation Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, reviews and approves the compensation of Apple&#146;s named executive officers and acts as the administering committee for Apple&#146;s employee equity compensation plans. The Compensation Committee&#146;s executive compensation determinations are subjective and the result of the Compensation Committee&#146;s business judgment, which is informed by the experience of its members and input provided by its independent compensation consultant, our CEO (other than with respect to his own compensation), other members of management, and shareholders. Each year, the Compensation Committee conducts an evaluation of Apple&#146;s executive compensation program to determine any appropriate changes. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee may consult with its independent compensation consultant and management, as described below; however, the Compensation Committee makes final decisions regarding the compensation paid to our named executive officers based on its own judgment. In determining whether to make changes to our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee may consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the size, scope, and performance of our business, evolving compensation trends, financial goals, and shareholders&#146; interests. The Role of the Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee selects and retains the services of its own independent compensation consultant and annually reviews the performance of the consultant. As part of the review process, the Compensation Committee considers the independence of the consultant in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. During 2020, the Compensation Committee&#146;s independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, provided no services to Apple other than services for the Compensation Committee, and worked with Apple&#146;s management, as directed by the Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the Compensation Committee is responsible. At the Compensation Committee&#146;s request, Pay Governance regularly attends Compensation Committee meetings. Pay Governance also communicates with the Compensation Committee or the Chair of the Compensation Committee outside committee meetings regarding matters related to the Compensation Committee&#146;s responsibilities. In 2020, the Compensation Committee generally sought input from Pay Governance on a range of external market factors related to Apple&#146;s compensation programs, CEO pay, environmental, social, and governance performance metrics and other evolving compensation trends, appropriate market reference points, and market compensation data. Pay Governance also provided general observations about management&#146;s recommendations regarding the amount and form of compensation for our named executive officers. The Role of the Chief Executive Officer. At the Compensation Committee&#146;s request, Mr.&nbsp;Cook provides input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s evaluation and his direct knowledge of each named executive officer&#146;s performance and contributions when making compensation decisions. Mr.&nbsp;Cook is not present during Compensation Committee voting or deliberations regarding his own compensation. The Role of Shareholders. Shareholders are provided the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers and have indicated their strong support for the compensation of our named executive officers in each of the past five years. Most recently, 94% of votes cast on the say-on-pay &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 36 Table of Contents proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting voted in favor of our executive compensation program and there were no significant changes to our executive compensation program for 2020. We have ongoing discussions with many of our shareholders regarding various corporate governance topics, including environmental, social, and governance topics, executive compensation, and related trends. The Compensation Committee considers these discussions while reviewing our executive compensation program and will continue to consider shareholder feedback and the results of say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions. The Role of Peer Companies. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves peer group composition each year. With the assistance of Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee identified groups of companies to serve as market reference points for compensation comparison purposes for 2020. A primary peer group was developed for reference consisting of U.S.-based, stand-alone, publicly traded companies in the technology, media, and internet services industries that, in the Compensation Committee&#146;s view, compete with Apple for talent. The threshold revenue and market capitalization requirements for a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2020 were $15&nbsp;billion and $50&nbsp;billion, respectively. A secondary peer group of premier companies that have iconic brands or are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development and innovation for growth, and require highly-skilled employees was also developed as an additional reference set for the Compensation Committee. Based on the above criteria, Netflix was added to the primary peer group and 20 th Century Fox and Time Warner were removed from the primary peer group due to acquisitions. The secondary peer group remained the same. The chart below lists the companies in the primary and secondary peer groups. References in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis to peer companies include both the primary and the secondary peer group companies. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Primary Peer Group &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary&nbsp;Peer&nbsp;Group Alphabet &nbsp; IBM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3M Amazon &nbsp; Intel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American Express AT&amp;T &nbsp; Microsoft &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boeing Charter &nbsp; Netflix &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coca-Cola Cisco Systems &nbsp; Oracle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Electric Comcast &nbsp; Qualcomm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson Disney &nbsp; Verizon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nike Facebook &nbsp; Visa &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PepsiCo &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pfizer &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procter&nbsp;&amp; Gamble &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnitedHealth Group &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Compensation Committee considers peer group data provided by its independent compensation consultant and reviews compensation practices and program design at peer companies to inform its decision-making process so it can set total compensation levels that it believes are commensurate with the relative size, scope, and success of Apple. The Compensation Committee, however, does not set compensation components to meet specific benchmarks as compared to peer companies, such as targeting salaries at a specific market percentile. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 37 Table of Contents 2020 Named Executive Officer Compensation Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward exceptional performance in a straightforward and effective way, while also recognizing the size, scope, and success of Apple&#146;s business. The compensation of our named executive officers has three primary components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards. 2020 Annual Base Salary. Base salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation intended to attract and retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, internal pay equity, and Apple&#146;s financial results and size relative to peer companies. The annual base salaries for our named executive officers did not change for 2020. 2020 Annual Cash Incentive. Our annual cash incentive program is a variable, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#146; compensation that is aligned with Apple&#146;s annual financial results. Net sales and operating income, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are used as the performance measures for the annual cash incentive program because they reflect commonly recognized measures of overall company performance and profitability and are drivers of shareholder value creation. Our annual cash incentive program for 2020 retained the same structure as our annual cash incentive program for 2019, with no increases to the threshold, target, and maximum payout opportunities for our named executive officers. The annual cash incentive program provides payout opportunities based on the achievement of pre-determined financial goals that require our named executive officers to meet high standards of performance. Annual cash incentive payouts are determined based on an equal weighting for the net sales and operating income performance measures, as approved by the Compensation Committee, and are linearly interpolated for achievement between threshold, target, and maximum goals. The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures is 100% of each named executive officer&#146;s annual base salary. If the threshold performance level is reached, the total payout opportunity is 50% of the target payout opportunity, and if the maximum performance level is reached, the payout opportunity is capped at 200% of the target payout opportunity. Unless the threshold goal is achieved for a performance measure, there is no payout for that performance measure. The Compensation Committee may, in its judgment, reduce the actual payout of any individual&#146;s annual cash incentive based on Apple&#146;s performance and the Compensation Committee&#146;s subjective assessment of the named executive officer&#146;s overall performance. The Compensation Committee establishes threshold, target, and maximum performance goals under the annual incentive program based on factors relevant to the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee also considers financial results from prior years as a reference point, but focuses on setting goals that reflect current business conditions and an appropriate pay-for-performance outcome. When setting the goals for 2020, the Compensation Committee considered many factors, including, but not limited to a complex macroeconomic and socio-political environment, uncertain trade conditions, and the alignment between appropriate payout opportunities and strong financial results at threshold, target, and maximum performance goal levels. The Compensation Committee considered the likelihood of a range of scenarios for net sales and factors that were projected to have an impact on 2020 operating income, such as long-term strategic investments and acquisitions, foreign exchange headwinds, and tariffs. Based on these considerations, in the first quarter of 2020 the Compensation Committee set annual threshold, target and maximum cash incentive plan goals at levels they considered appropriately rigorous for the year, and that &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 38 Table of Contents represented continued strong financial performance under challenging business conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic was not a consideration at the time the 2020 annual incentive plan goals were set, nor did the Compensation Committee modify the annual incentive plan goals during the year due to COVID-19 related circumstances. For 2020, we reported net sales of $274.5 billion and operating income of $66.3 billion, representing 6% and 4% growth year-over year, respectively. These results exceeded the target goal for each performance measure and resulted in a payout equal to 179% of the total target payout opportunity under the annual cash incentive program. 2020 Annual Incentive Plan Goals and Results Goals and Results in $B &nbsp; &nbsp; The Compensation Committee considered the significant efforts of the executive team to deliver these strong financial results during 2020 and determined that no downward adjustments to the payouts would be made based on Apple&#146;s 2020 performance and the individual contributions of our named executive officers. Accordingly, bonus payouts equal to 179% of the target payout opportunity were approved for each of our named executive officers. &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking Forward . Beginning in 2021, an environmental, social, and governance modifier based on Apple Values and other key community initiatives will be incorporated into our annual cash incentive program. This change is intended to further motivate Apple&#146;s executive team to meet exceptionally high standards of values-driven leadership in addition to delivering strong financial results. The financial performance measures and the threshold, target, and maximum payout opportunities under our annual cash incentive program for our named executive officers will not change. However, the Compensation Committee will use the modifier to determine whether to increase or decrease the bonus payouts by up to 10% based on the Compensation Committee&#146;s evaluation of our named executive officers&#146; performance with respect to Apple Values and other key community initiatives during 2021. &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 39 Table of Contents Long-Term Equity Awards The equity component of our named executive officers&#146; compensation emphasizes long-term shareholder value creation through performance-based and time-based RSU awards. Performance-Based RSUs. RSU awards with performance-based vesting are a substantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#146; compensation tied to Apple&#146;s long-term performance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest depends on Apple&#146;s total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&amp;P 500 (&#147;Relative TSR&#148;) for the performance period. The Compensation Committee chose Relative TSR as a straightforward and objective metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other companies and to align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value. We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on the change in each company&#146;s stock price during that period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. A 20-trading-day averaging period is used to determine the beginning and ending stock price values used to calculate the total shareholder return of Apple and the other companies in the S&amp;P 500. This averaging period mitigates the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period. The change in stock price value from the beginning to the end of the period is divided by the beginning stock price value to determine total shareholder return. Time-Based RSUs. RSU awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive team over the longer term. Vesting schedules for time-based awards are generally longer than typical peer company practices and require continuous service over multiple years, as described below. CEO Long-Term Equity Mr.&nbsp;Cook was granted an RSU Award when he was promoted to CEO in 2011 (the &#147;2011 RSU Award&#148;). At grant, the 2011 RSU Award only had a time-based vesting schedule with 50% of the RSUs vesting on each of the 5- and 10-year anniversaries of the grant date. The 2011 RSU Award was significantly modified in 2013, at Mr. Cook&#146;s request, to put a portion of the award at risk by applying a performance condition based on Apple&#146;s Relative TSR performance over the applicable three-year performance period. The performance condition for Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s 2011 RSU Award requires Apple to outperform two-thirds of the companies that were included in the S&amp;P 500 for the entirety of each performance period in order for 100% of the performance-based RSUs allocated to that period to vest. The 2011 RSU Award has only downside risk to Mr.&nbsp;Cook. It does not contain any upside vesting opportunity above 100%, and there is no interpolation for results between the Relative TSR percentile levels set forth below. &nbsp; Relative TSR Percentile v.

As shown in the table below, Apple&#146;s Relative TSR for the three-year performance period was at the 99th percentile of the companies that were included in the S&amp;P 500 for the entire performance period. As a result, 100% of the 1,120,000 performance-based RSUs vested on August&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2020. Apple&#146;s total shareholder return during this period was 194.89%. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Relative&nbsp;TSR&nbsp;Percentile&nbsp;Ranking for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Period &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TSR&nbsp;Results for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Period Apple &nbsp;&nbsp; 99th Percentile &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 194.89% S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Top Third &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8805; 48.28% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Middle Third &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; -3.89% &#150; 48.27% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom Third &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;-3.89% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking Forward . The final tranches of time-based and performance-based RSUs from Mr. Cook&#146;s 2011 RSU Award are scheduled to vest in August 2021. During 2021 we will also mark the tenth anniversary of Mr. Cook&#146;s leadership as Apple&#146;s CEO. The Board believes Mr. Cook brings unparalleled innovation and focus to the CEO role, demonstrates what it means to lead with values and integrity, and consistently delivers incredible results for our shareholders. Since his promotion to the role of CEO on August 24, 2011 through the period ended September 25, 2020, Apple&#146;s market capitalization increased by more than $1.5 trillion and Apple&#146;s total shareholder return, including reinvestment of dividends, was 867%. In recognition of his outstanding leadership and with great optimism for Apple&#146;s future as he carries these efforts forward, Mr. Cook was granted an RSU award on September 27, 2020, the first day of Apple&#146;s 2021 fiscal year. The RSU award was determined taking into consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple, and Mr. Cook&#146;s tenure and performance as CEO. This is the first RSU award granted to Mr. Cook since his promotion to the role of CEO in 2011, and will better align his time-based and performance-based equity incentives with those granted to our other named executive officers. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 41 Table of Contents Other Named Executive Officers&#146; Long-Term Equity In 2020, the Compensation Committee granted performance-based and time-based RSUs to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams (the &#147;2020 RSU Awards&#148;). 2020 Performance-Based RSU Awards. The performance-based RSUs awarded to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams were granted on September&nbsp;29, 2019, which was the first day of Apple&#146;s 2020 fiscal year and the first day of the performance period applicable to the awards. These awards have a three-fiscal-year performance period from the beginning of 2020 through the end of 2022. The target number of performance-based RSUs granted to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams was determined by dividing $10&nbsp;million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair values for these awards are reported in the table entitled &#147;Summary Compensation Table &#150; 2020, 2019, and 2018.&#148; Between zero and 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs will vest on October&nbsp;1, 2022, subject to continued employment through that date, depending on Apple&#146;s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the performance period, as follows: &nbsp; Relative TSR Percentile v. S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp; Performance-Based RSUs Vesting As a Percentage of Target &nbsp; 85th Percentile or above &nbsp; &nbsp; 200% &nbsp; &nbsp; 55th Percentile &nbsp; &nbsp; 100% &nbsp; &nbsp; 25th Percentile &nbsp; &nbsp; 25% &nbsp; &nbsp; Below 25th &nbsp; 0% If Apple&#146;s total shareholder return for the performance period is negative, the number of performance-based RSUs that will vest is capped at 100% of the target number of performance-based RSUs regardless of our percentile ranking. If Apple&#146;s Relative TSR percentile ranking is above the 25th percentile and between the other levels shown in the table above, the portion of the performance-based RSUs that will vest is linearly interpolated between the two nearest vesting percentages. 2020 Performance-Based RSU Payout Results. During 2020, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri and Mr.&nbsp;Williams each vested in performance-based RSUs that were granted on September&nbsp;25, 2016. Similar to the design of the 2020 RSU Awards described above, between zero and 200% of the target number of these performance-based RSUs were scheduled to vest based on Apple&#146;s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the applicable performance period, with a maximum 200% vesting for performance at or above the 85th percentile. For the three-year performance period from the beginning of fiscal 2017 through the end of fiscal 2019, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri and Mr.&nbsp;Williams each vested in 517,232 performance-based RSUs, representing 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs. As shown in the table below, Apple&#146;s Relative TSR was at the 93 rd percentile of the companies that were included in the S&amp;P 500 for the three-year performance period, and Apple&#146;s total shareholder return during this period was 108.28%. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 42 Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Relative&nbsp;TSR&nbsp;Percentile&nbsp;Ranking for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Period &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TSR&nbsp;Results for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Period &nbsp; Apple &nbsp;&nbsp; 93 rd Percentile &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 108.28% S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 85th Percentile &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 86.59% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 55th Percentile &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 43.22% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 25th Percentile &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.64% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Below 25th &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;0.64% &nbsp; 2020 Time-Based RSU Awards. The time-based RSUs awarded to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams were granted on September&nbsp;29, 2019, which was the first day of Apple&#146;s 2020 fiscal year. The number of time-based RSUs granted to each of these named executive officers was determined by dividing $10&nbsp;million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair values for these awards are reported in the table entitled &#147;Summary Compensation Table &#150; 2020, 2019, and 2018.&#148; The time-based RSUs granted to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams vest over approximately four and one-half years, with three equal installments vesting annually commencing on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date), subject to continued employment through each vesting date. The April vesting dates for the time-based RSUs were selected to balance the October vesting of the performance-based RSUs and provide regular vesting intervals. Dividend Equivalents All RSUs have dividend equivalent rights except Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s 2011 RSU Award, which was not modified to allow for dividend equivalents at his request. Other Benefits Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare programs, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) plan, matching gifts program, vacation cash-out program, and other benefit programs on the same basis as other employees. Deferred Compensation Plan. &nbsp;Under the DCP, our named executive officers&nbsp;are eligible to defer a portion of their&nbsp;eligible compensation, including a portion of their annual cash incentive opportunity,&nbsp;subject to the terms of the DCP. Security and Private Aircraft. We provide risk-based, business-related, and personal security services for our employees, including our named executive officers, as determined to be appropriate by our security team. We consider the security measures provided to our named executive officers to be reasonable and necessary &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 43 Table of Contents expenses for the benefit of Apple and not a personal benefit. However, in accordance with SEC disclosure rules, the aggregate incremental cost of these services is reported in the table entitled &#147;Summary Compensation Table&nbsp;&#150; 2020, 2019, and 2018.&#148; In the interests of security and efficiency based on our global profile and the highly visible nature of Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s role as CEO, the Board requires that Mr.&nbsp;Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr.&nbsp;Cook recognizes imputed taxable income and is not provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of private aircraft. Governance and Other Considerations Tax Deductibility of Compensation Expense. &nbsp;Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally places a $1&nbsp;million limit on the amount of compensation a publicly held company can deduct in any tax year on compensation paid to &#147;covered employees.&#148; Prior to the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, performance-based compensation paid to our &#147;covered employees,&#148; such as annual cash incentives and performance-based RSUs, was generally excluded from this $1&nbsp;million deduction limit. As a result of changes in the tax law, this previously-available exclusion for performance-based compensation is generally no longer available after 2018. While the Compensation Committee considers tax deductibility as one of many factors in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee will award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if such compensation is not tax deductible by Apple and may modify compensation that was initially intended to be tax deductible if it determines that such modifications are consistent with Apple&#146;s business needs.&nbsp;Thus, a majority of the amounts payable under our executive compensation arrangements will not be tax deductible or, if initially intended to be tax deductible, may not actually receive this treatment. Compensation Clawback. The terms of all outstanding RSU awards held by our named executive officers allow us to recoup any shares or other amount that may be paid in respect of RSUs in the event the individual engages in certain acts of misconduct. Beginning in 2020, the Compensation Committee extended its compensation recoupment policy to the annual cash incentives awarded to our named executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in the event the named executive officer commits a felony while employed by Apple or, while employed by Apple or at any time thereafter, the individual engages in a breach of confidentiality, materially breaches any agreement with Apple, commits an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or if Apple is required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of the named executive officer&#146;s misconduct. Prohibition on Hedging, Pledging, and Short Sales. We prohibit short sales, hedging, and transactions in derivatives of Apple securities for all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, and consultants. In addition, we prohibit pledging of Apple stock as collateral by directors and executive officers of Apple. We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange funds. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Under our stock ownership guidelines, Mr.&nbsp;Cook is expected to own shares of Apple stock that have a value equal to 10 times his annual base salary. All other executive officers are expected to own shares that have a value equal to three times their annual base salary within five years of the officer first becoming subject to the guidelines. Each executive officer currently holds shares in excess of these guidelines. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with or separately by the individual&#146;s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual&#146;s spouse, or the individual&#146;s children. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 44 Table of Contents Risk Considerations. In establishing and reviewing Apple&#146;s executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and has concluded that it does not. See the section entitled &#147;Corporate Governance&#150;Board Oversight of Risk Management&#148; above for an additional discussion of risk considerations. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 45 Table of Contents Executive Compensation Tables Summary Compensation Table&#151;2020, 2019, and 2018 The following table, footnotes, and related narrative show information regarding the total compensation of each named executive officer for 2020, 2019, and 2018, except in the case of Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien who was not a named executive officer in 2018. &nbsp; &nbsp; Name and Principal Position (a) &nbsp; Year (b) &nbsp; &nbsp; Salary ($)(c) &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonus ($)(d) &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Awards (1) ($)(e) &nbsp; &nbsp; Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation (2) ($)(f) &nbsp; &nbsp; All Other Compensation ($)(h) &nbsp; &nbsp; Total ($)(i) &nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Cook &nbsp; Chief&nbsp;Executive&nbsp;Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10,731,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,038,259 (3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,769,259 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7,671,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 884,466 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11,555,466 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2018 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 682,219 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15,682,219 &nbsp; &nbsp; Luca Maestri &nbsp; Senior Vice President, Chief&nbsp;Financial&nbsp;Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18,583 (4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,253,270 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,633,416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,557,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19,221 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25,209,637 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2018 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,491,888 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,804 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,509,692 &nbsp; &nbsp; Kate Adams &nbsp; Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,310 (5) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,248,995 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,633,416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,557,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 41,384 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25,231,800 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2018 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 884,615 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,509,765 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 306,280 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,700,660 &nbsp; &nbsp; Deirdre O&#146;Brien &nbsp; Senior Vice President, Retail&nbsp;+ People &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 37,684 (6) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,272,371 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 877,500 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16,469,527 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,795,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,753 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19,159,780 &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeff Williams &nbsp; Chief Operating&nbsp;Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,137 (7) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,251,824 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,633,416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,557,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,503 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25,207,919 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2018 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,491,888 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51,818 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,543,706 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) The grant date fair value for time-based RSUs is measured in accordance with FASB ASC 718 and based on the closing price of Apple&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for performance-based RSUs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo model for each award on the date of grant, as determined under FASB ASC 718 based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The fair value for each award may differ based on the applicable data, assumptions, and estimates used in the model. See Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies found in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2020, and also see footnote 1 to the table entitled &#147;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&#151;2020.&#148; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) As described under &#147;Executive Compensation&#151;Compensation Discussion and Analysis,&#148; the named executive officers&#146; annual cash incentives are based on the performance of Apple relative to pre-determined financial goals for the year and the performance of the individual named executive &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 46 Table of Contents &nbsp; officer. The threshold, target, and maximum payout amounts for each named executive officer&#146;s 2020 annual cash incentive opportunity are shown in the table entitled &#147;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&#151;2020.&#148; In 2020, Apple&#146;s performance exceeded the target performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a total payout of 179% of the target payout opportunity for each named executive officer. The Compensation Committee determined that no downward adjustments would be made based on Apple&#146;s or an individual&#146;s performance and approved this payout amount for each named executive officer. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) This amount represents: (i) Apple&#146;s contributions to Mr. Cook&#146;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,100; (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $2,964; (iii) vacation cash-out in the amount of $115,385; (iv) security expenses in the amount of $470,246, which represents the incremental cost to Apple for personal security services provided to Mr. Cook as determined by allocating both direct costs and a percentage of fixed costs incurred by Apple and used to provide such personal security services; and (v) personal air travel expenses in the amount of $432,564, which represents the incremental cost to Apple for Mr. Cook&#146;s personal use of private aircraft based on hourly flight charges and other variable costs incurred by Apple for such use, including variable fuel charges, departure fees, and landing fees. For security and efficiency reasons, the Board implemented a policy in 2017 that requires Mr. Cook to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (4) This amount represents: (i) Apple&#146;s contributions to Mr. Maestri&#146;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,100; and (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $1,483. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (5) This amount represents: (i) Apple&#146;s contributions to Ms. Adams&#146; account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $12,825; and (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $1,483. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (6) This amount represents: (i) Apple&#146;s contributions to Ms. O&#146;Brien&#146;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,100; (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $1,353; and (iii) vacation cash-out in the amount of $19,231. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (7) This amount represents: (i) Apple&#146;s contributions to Mr. Williams&#146; account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,100; and (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $37. &nbsp; The amounts in the salary, bonus, and non-equity incentive plan compensation columns of the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2020, 2019, and 2018&#148; reflect actual amounts earned in the relevant years, while the amounts in the stock awards column reflect accounting values.

The estimated values for performance-based RSUs are shown at the maximum potential payout amounts. &nbsp; &nbsp; Name &nbsp; Estimated Total&nbsp;Value&nbsp;of Equity Acceleration upon Death (1) ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Estimated Total&nbsp;Value&nbsp;of Equity Acceleration upon&nbsp;Disability (1) ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Cook &nbsp; &nbsp; 527,683,327 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 355,621,862 &nbsp; &nbsp; Luca Maestri &nbsp; &nbsp; 176,359,284 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 121,399,865 &nbsp; &nbsp; Kate Adams &nbsp; &nbsp; 142,324,558 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 108,535,080 &nbsp; &nbsp; Deirdre O&#146;Brien &nbsp; &nbsp; 79,222,314 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 39,554,042 &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeff Williams &nbsp; &nbsp; 176,359,284 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 121,399,865 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) The dollar amounts are determined by (i)&nbsp;multiplying the number of RSUs that would have been subject to accelerated vesting if the officer had died or become disabled on September&nbsp;25, 2020, as applicable, by $112.28, the closing price of Apple&#146;s common stock on that date; and (ii)&nbsp;then adding any accumulated dividend equivalents attributable to any such RSUs on that date. &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 55 Table of Contents CEO Pay Ratio &#150; 2020 The 2020 annual total compensation of our CEO was $14,769,259, the 2020 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $57,783, and the ratio of these amounts is 256 to 1. For 2020, we used the same median employee that was identified in 2019 since there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. We determined our median compensated employee in 2019 by using base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2019 as our consistently applied compensation measure. We applied this measure to our global employee population as of September 28, 2019, the last day of our 2019 fiscal year, and annualized base salaries for permanent full-time and part-time employees that did not work the full year. We calculated the median compensated employee&#146;s 2020 annual total compensation using the same methodology that is used to calculate our CEO&#146;s annual total compensation in the table entitled &#147;Summary Compensation Table &#150; 2020, 2019, and 2018.&#148; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 56 Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp; Proposals This section sets out each item of business for the Annual Meeting and the Board&#146;s voting recommendation. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 57 Table of Contents Proposal No.&nbsp;1 &#150; Election of Directors The Board has nominated directors Bell, Cook, Gore, Jung, Levinson, Lozano, Sugar, and Wagner to be elected to serve on our Board until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. At the Annual Meeting, proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of individuals than the eight nominees named in this Proxy Statement. Holders of proxies solicited by this Proxy Statement will vote the proxies received by them as directed on the proxy card or, if no direction is made, for the election of the Board&#146;s eight nominees. The term of any incumbent director who does not receive the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum, and has not earlier resigned, will end on the date that is the earlier of (a) 90 days after the date on which the voting results for the Annual Meeting are determined by the inspector of election, or (b)&nbsp;the date on which the Board selects a person to fill the office held by that director in accordance with Apple&#146;s bylaws. Each of the directors nominated by the Board has consented to serving as a nominee, being named in this Proxy Statement, and serving on the Board if elected. Each director elected at the Annual Meeting will be elected to serve a one-year term. If any nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders may vote for any nominee designated by the present Board to fill the vacancy. There are no family relationships among Apple&#146;s executive officers and directors. For more information on the director nominees, please see the biographies of the director nominees beginning on page 25. The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of directors Bell, Cook, Gore, Jung, Levinson, Lozano, Sugar, and Wagner. &nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required Apple has implemented majority voting in uncontested elections of directors. Accordingly, Apple&#146;s bylaws provide that in an uncontested election of directors the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum is required to elect a director. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 58 Table of Contents Proposal No.&nbsp;2 &#150; Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee has re-appointed Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm and as auditors of Apple&#146;s consolidated financial statements for 2021. The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm annually. In making the determination to re-appoint Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young for 2021, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors, the independence and performance of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young, and the quality and candor of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young&#146;s communications with the Audit Committee and management. Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young has served as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm since 2009. At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for 2021. Although ratification of the Audit Committee&#146;s appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young is not required, we value the opinions of our shareholders and believe that shareholder ratification of the appointment is a good corporate governance practice. In the event of a negative vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Representatives of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to questions. Fees Paid to Auditors The following table shows the fees billed by Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended September&nbsp;26, 2020 and September&nbsp;28, 2019. &nbsp; &nbsp; Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young &nbsp; 2020 ($) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019 ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Audit Fees (1) &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,568,300 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 17,208,700 &nbsp; &nbsp; Audit-Related Fees (2) &nbsp; &nbsp; 935,900 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 942,400 &nbsp; &nbsp; Tax Fees (3) &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,382,300 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,019,100 &nbsp; &nbsp; All Other Fees (4) &nbsp; &nbsp; 297,400 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 115,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; 22,183,900 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 21,285,200 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of Apple&#146;s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) Audit-related fees relate to professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Apple&#146;s financial statements. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) Tax fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to tax returns and tax audits, as well as for tax consulting and planning services. Tax fees in 2020 include $1.1&nbsp;million for tax compliance projects and $2.3&nbsp;million for tax advisory projects. Tax fees in 2019 include $0.9&nbsp;million for tax compliance projects and $2.1&nbsp;million for tax advisory projects. &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 59 Table of Contents &nbsp; (4) All other fees relate to professional services not included in the categories above, including services related to other regulatory reporting requirements. &nbsp; Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services for Apple, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services expected to be performed each year by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for other permissible non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit Committee. In accordance with this policy, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm in 2020. The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No.&nbsp;2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;2 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 60 Table of Contents Proposal No.&nbsp;3 &#150; Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation In accordance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, our shareholders have the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC&#146;s compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables (a &#147;say-on-pay&#148; vote). Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward exceptional performance in a straightforward and effective way, while also recognizing the size, scope, and success of Apple&#146;s business. We believe that the compensation of our named executive officers appropriately reflects and rewards&nbsp;their significant contributions to Apple&#146;s strong performance in a year that presented unique and unprecedented challenges for our executive team. We encourage shareholders to read the section entitled &#147;Compensation Discussion and Analysis,&#148; beginning on page 34, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2020. At the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, 94% of votes cast supported our executive compensation program. We have ongoing discussions with many of our shareholders regarding various corporate governance topics, including environmental, social, and governance topics, executive compensation, and related trends. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider shareholder feedback and the results of say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions. Shareholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC&#146;s executive compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables, is hereby approved. &nbsp; &nbsp; As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on Apple, the Board, or the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding named executive officers. It is expected that the next say-on-pay vote will occur at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No.&nbsp;3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;3 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 61 Table of Contents Proposal No. 4 &#150; Shareholder Proposal &nbsp; &nbsp; Shareholder Proxy Access Amendments RESOLVED: Shareholders of Apple, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Apple&#148;) ask the board of directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) to amend its &#147;Proxy Access for Director Nominations&#148; bylaw, and any other associated documents, to include the following changes or their equivalent for the purpose of increasing the potential number of nominees: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of &#147;Shareholder Nominees&#148; eligible to appear in proxy materials shall be 20% of the directors then serving or 2, whichever is greater. &nbsp; Supporting Statement: Current proxy access bylaws restrict Shareholder Nominees to 20% of directors rounded down to the nearest whole number. Apple has only 7 directors. 20% of 7, rounding down to the nearest whole number is 1. Therefore, Apple allows shareholders to nominate only one director, given the current board size. The Council of Institutional Investors notes: &#147;It is important that shareholder nominees have meaningful representation on the board, and in many or most cases, one director is insufficient to achieve that goal. Having at least two nominees helps ensure that the nominees, if elected, can serve on multiple committees and have greater opportunities to bring an independent perspective into board decisions.&#148; (Proxy Access: Best Practices 2017, https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/08/28/proxy-access-best-practices-2017/) Sidley Austin reports that 86% of companies with proxy access allow either a minimum of 2 directors to be nominated or 25% of the board. Only 14% have the same standard as Apple &#150; 20% of the board with no minimum. (Proxy Access: A Five-Year Review, https://www.sidley.com/-/media/update-pdfs/2020/01/proxy-access/ proxy-access_-a-fiveyear-review-jan-2020--w-appendices.pdf?la=en) Apple&#146;s previous opposition statement argued, &#147;Our proxy access bylaws overall are well within the mainstream of public company practices and share similar features with the proxy access bylaws of many other companies.&#148; However, the majority of companies with a similar standard, 20% of the board with no minimum, have boards of 10 or more, so 20% still yields at least 2 nominees. Only a very small minority of the 14%, like Arch Coal and EOG Resources (formerly Enron Oil&nbsp;&amp; Gas Company), limit proxy access candidates to 1. Should these distinct outliers really be our peer group? Are these laggards really the &#147;mainstream&#148; companies we want Apple to emulate? In a request to the SEC, our Company alleged the Proposal&#146;s Supporting Statement &#147;falsely describes the Company as a &#147;distinct outlier&#148; and a &#147;laggard&#148; in regards to its access bylaw. These statements are objectively and demonstrably false and misleading...&#148; The SEC flatly rejected Apple&#146;s request. &#147;We are unable to conclude that you have demonstrated objectively that the Proposal is materially false and misleading.&#148; (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/mcritchieapple112118-14a8.pdf) Apple has proxy access but is out of step with industry best practices, which allow shareholders to nominate up to 20% of the board or 2, whichever is greater. Increase Shareholder Value Vote FOR Shareholder Proxy Access Amendments &#150; Proposal 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 62 Table of Contents Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&nbsp;4 The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;4. Apple has received a proxy access proposal every year for the last seven years and, in each case, the proposal failed to receive majority support. As in previous years, we continue to believe that the changes advocated by the proponent are not necessary because Apple shareholders already have an effective mechanism for proxy access. Apple has a small Board compared to many public companies, and if approved this proposal could have negative unintended consequences, putting the company and shareholder value at risk. After careful consideration of the varying viewpoints offered by many of our shareholders, the Board amended Apple&#146;s bylaws to adopt proxy access in December&nbsp;2015. The bylaws permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of Apple&#146;s outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in Apple&#146;s annual proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the procedural and eligibility requirements specified in the bylaws. After closely monitoring proxy access developments and engaging with many of our largest shareholders, governance experts, and advisors to discuss evolving market practices and the preferences of our shareholders, the Board adopted enhancements to the &#147;secondary&#148; elements of the proxy access provisions in our bylaws in December&nbsp;2016. These enhancements made it easier for shareholders to nominate proxy access candidates by eliminating the requirement that a nominating shareholder&#146;s loaned shares be recalled at the time the shareholder provides notice to Apple; eliminating the prohibition on re-nomination of a proxy access candidate if the candidate receives a low level of support at the annual meeting; limiting the circumstances under which the maximum number of proxy access candidates is reduced; extending the deadline by which nominating shareholders and proxy access candidates must provide certain information to Apple; narrowing the scope of a nominating shareholder&#146;s indemnification obligations; and limiting the discretion of the Board to unilaterally interpret the proxy access provisions. Overall, our proxy access bylaws are well within the mainstream of public company practices and share similar features with the proxy access bylaws of many other companies. We have regular, ongoing engagement with many of our shareholders and have determined that there is not a strong preference to modify the existing proxy access provisions in our bylaws. We strongly believe that increasing the potential level of Board representation to the greater of two directors and 20% of the Board could have unintended effects that could negatively impact shareholder value, including promoting the use of proxy access to lay the groundwork for effecting a change of control; encouraging the pursuit of special interests at the expense of a holistic, long-term strategic view; or otherwise disrupting the effective functioning of the Board. Our Board has also shown an ongoing commitment to having highly qualified, independent voices in the boardroom through a robust director nomination and annual self-evaluation process. We are committed to ensuring effective, balanced corporate governance while also continually engaging with shareholders. The Board continues to believe that these objectives are being achieved through Apple&#146;s current governance processes and that changing our proxy access framework yet again, as outlined by the proposal, is unnecessary, unwarranted, and potentially detrimental to shareholder value. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;4. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 63 Table of Contents &nbsp; Vote Required Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;4 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 64 Table of Contents Proposal No.&nbsp;5 &#150; Shareholder Proposal &nbsp; &nbsp; Shareholder Proposal to Improve Executive Compensation Program Resolved: shareholders recommend that Apple Inc. improve the executive compensation program to include NEOs pay ratios and other factors. Supporting Statement Apple&#146;s executive compensation program considers only two factors: &#147;consistent and effective program design&#148; which means annual base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity awards, and &#147;aligned with shareholder interests and company performance&#148; (2020 Proxy Statement p. 5) without any consideration of ethical, social and economic factors, such as the NEOs pay ratios. In 2018, the four NEOs (except CEO) pay ratios to the median compensated employee pay are larger than 478 to 1 ($26,509,692 to $55,426, Ibid. p.41); in 2019, the five NEOs (except CEO) average pay $23,417,476 ($25,209,637, $25,231,800, $19,159,780, $25,207,919, $22,278,242, Ibid. p.41) to the median compensated employee pay $57,596 (Ibid. p.52) ratio is 407 to 1. There is no rational methodology or program to decide the executive compensation. For example, Twitter&#146;s CEO pay ratio is less than 0.001 to 1 in 2018 and in 2019, Amazon&#146;s CEO pay ratio is 58 to 1 in 2018 and in 2019. JCPenney&#146;s alarming CEO pay ratio 1294 to 1 in 2018 is one cause leading to its bankruptcy. The executive compensations of big Japanese and European companies are much less than big American companies. America&#146;s ballooning executive compensation is neither responsible for the society nor sustainable for the economy, especially under the current pandemic crisis. Reducing the NEOs pay ratios should be included to the principles of executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee has the flexibility to include other ethical, social and economic factors. &nbsp; Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&nbsp;5 The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;5. Our executive compensation program is based on clear guiding principles and sound compensation practices that align the compensation of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders. It is designed to motivate and reward exceptional performance in a straightforward and effective way, while also recognizing the size, scope, and success of Apple&#146;s business. Moreover, shareholders have an annual opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and have indicated strong support for our executive compensation program for each of the past five years. While the ratio of CEO pay to the pay of the median compensated employee is a required disclosure under SEC rules, the Compensation Committee does not believe that the pay ratios of our named executive officers should generally define or guide the principles of our executive compensation program. However, we fundamentally agree that it is important to take actions that drive accountability in areas that are important to the long-term success of our business, and beginning in 2021, an environmental, social, and governance modifier based on Apple Values and other key community initiatives will be incorporated into the annual cash incentive program for our named executive officers. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 65 Table of Contents The Board believes that the Compensation Committee is best positioned to evaluate and determine the design and effectiveness of our executive compensation program based on factors relevant to our business. Additional information on our executive compensation program can be found in the earlier Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;5 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 66 Table of Contents Identification of Proponents Each of Proposals No.&nbsp;4 and No. 5 were submitted for the Annual Meeting by a shareholder or shareholders who have represented to Apple that they are a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of Apple&#146;s common stock.&nbsp;We will promptly provide you with the name, address, and, to our knowledge, the number of voting securities held by the proponents of the shareholder proposals, upon receiving a written or oral request directed to Apple&#146;s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 169-5GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA. Other Matters Apple knows of no other matters to be submitted to shareholders at the Annual Meeting, other than the proposals identified in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters properly come before shareholders at the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named on the proxy to vote the shares represented thereby on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 67 Table of Contents &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 68 Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp; Other Information This section includes the Audit and Finance Committee Report, information about stock ownership and our equity compensation plans, and other general information. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 69 Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Audit and Finance Committee Report As of October&nbsp;26, 2020, the date of this report, the Audit and Finance Committee consisted of three members: Ron&nbsp;Sugar, who serves as the Chair of the Committee, James Bell, and Sue Wagner. Each member is an independent director under Nasdaq and SEC rules, and meets the standards for committee independence as set forth in Apple&#146;s&nbsp;Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Audit and Finance Committee has the duties and powers described in&nbsp;its&nbsp;written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the charter is available on Apple&#146;s website at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board&#146;s oversight and monitoring of: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Apple&#146;s financial statements and other financial information provided by Apple to its shareholders and others; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; compliance with legal, regulatory, and public disclosure requirements; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; the independent auditors, including their qualifications and independence; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Apple&#146;s system of internal controls, including the internal audit function; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; treasury and finance matters; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; enterprise risk management, privacy, and data security; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; the auditing, accounting, and financial reporting process generally. &nbsp; The Audit and Finance Committee does not itself prepare financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of Apple&#146;s financial statements. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work performed by Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee carefully reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services. Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit and Finance Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit and Finance Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended September&nbsp;26, 2020 with Apple&#146;s management and Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young. The Audit and Finance Committee has also discussed with Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) and the SEC. The Audit and Finance Committee also has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young&#146;s communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young its independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements referred to above be included in Apple&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September&nbsp;26, 2020 for filing with the SEC.

Voting Each share of Apple&#146;s common stock has one vote on each matter. Only &#147;shareholders of record&#148; as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.

You may revoke your proxy and change your vote by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form dated as of a later date, in which case only your latest proxy card or voting instruction form received prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. &nbsp; Uninstructed Shares Shareholders of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and you: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Indicate when voting online or by phone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board; or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, &nbsp; then the persons named as proxy holders, Kate Adams and Luca Maestri, will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as they may determine in their best judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the broker that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then such broker may generally vote your shares in their discretion on &#147;routine&#148; matters, but cannot vote on &#147;non-routine&#148; matters. Routine and Non-Routine Proposals The following proposal is considered a routine matter: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The ratification of the appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for 2021 (Proposal No.&nbsp;2). &nbsp; A broker or other nominee may generally vote in their discretion on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected in connection with Proposal No.&nbsp;2. &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 78 Table of Contents The following proposals are considered non-routine matters: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Election of directors (Proposal No.&nbsp;1); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Advisory vote to approve executive compensation (Proposal No.&nbsp;3); and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Each of shareholder Proposals No.&nbsp;4 and No.&nbsp;5. &nbsp; If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a &#147;broker non-vote.&#148; Therefore, broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposal No.&nbsp;1 and Proposals No.&nbsp;3 through No.&nbsp;5. Vote Required to Approve a Proposal With respect to the election of directors (Proposal No.&nbsp;1), Apple&#146;s bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting; and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum is required to elect a director. An &#147;uncontested election of directors&#148; means an election of directors in which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election. Approval of Proposals No.&nbsp;2 through No.&nbsp;5 requires, in each case, the affirmative vote of both (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting; and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Only &#147;FOR&#148; and &#147;AGAINST&#148; votes are counted for purposes of determining the votes received in connection with each proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on determining whether the affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting. In addition, for each proposal, the affirmative vote equal to a majority of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum is also required for approval. Therefore, broker non-votes and abstentions could prevent the election of a director or the approval of a proposal because they do not count as affirmative votes. Confidentiality of Votes Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Apple will not disclose the proxy instructions or ballots of individual shareholders, except: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To allow for the tabulation and certification of votes; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To facilitate a successful proxy solicitation; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To assert claims for Apple; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To defend claims against Apple; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; As necessary to meet applicable legal requirements. &nbsp; &nbsp; Apple Inc. | 2021 Proxy Statement | 79 Table of Contents If you write comments on your proxy card or ballot, the proxy card or ballot may be forwarded to Apple&#146;s management and the Board to review your comments. Tabulation and Reporting of Voting Results Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election after the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. Apple will publish the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.

The proposal must be submitted by a shareholder of record and must set forth the information required by Apple&#146;s bylaws.
