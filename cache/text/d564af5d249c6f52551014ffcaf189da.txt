Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020. In making the assessment, management used the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0. The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jennifer Piepszak Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer F e b r u a r y 2 3 , 2 0 2 1 Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 158 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. Basis for Opinions The Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those p o l i c i e s a n d p r o c e d u r e s t h a t ( i ) p e r t a i n t o t h e m a i n t e n a n c e of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the c o m p a n y ; ( i i ) p r o v i d e r e a s o n a b l e a s s u r a n c e t h a t transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and d i r e c t o r s o f t h e c o m p a n y ; a n d ( i i i ) p r o v i d e r e a s o n a b l e assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  300 Madison Avenue  New York, NY 10017 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 159 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio- based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $23.4 billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $653.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables. Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.2 trillion of its assets and $437.6 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $10.3 billion of trading assets and $41.5 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include forward equity prices, volatility relating to interest rates and equity prices and correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 160 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s processes for determining fair value which include controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable inputs; and comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are a c c o u n t e d f o r ( i ) i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h t h e e q u i t y m e t h o d o f accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its p r o p o r t i o n a t e s h a r e o f t h e e n t i t y ’ s n e t e a r n i n g s ) , o r ( i i ) a t fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non- affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately- held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities V I E s a r e e n t i t i e s t h a t , b y d e s i g n , e i t h e r ( 1 ) l a c k s u f f i c i e n t equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and Notes to consolidated financial statements JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 167 circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation f r a m e w o r k ; a n d ( 2 ) w h e t h e r c h a n g e s i n t h e f a c t s a n d circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level- yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion of interest income. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Notes to consolidated financial statements 168 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements. Statements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks. Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”) The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 13 for further information. Prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses represented management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments. The following table presents the impacts to the allowance for credit losses and retained earnings upon adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2020: (in billions) December 31, 2019 CECL adoption impact January 1, 2020 Allowance for credit losses Consumer, excluding credit card(a) $ 2.6 $ 0.4 $ 3.0 Credit card 5.7 5.5 11.2 Wholesale(a) 6.0 (1.6) 4.4 Firmwide $ 14.3 $ 4.3 $ 18.6 Retained earnings Firmwide allowance increase $ 4.3 Balance sheet reclassification(b) (0.8) Total pre-tax impact 3.5 Tax effect (0.8) Decrease to retained earnings $ 2.7 (a) In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk- rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Accordingly, $ 0 . 6 b i l l i o n of the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 and $ ( 0 . 2 ) b i l l i o n of the CECL adoption impact were reclassified. (b) Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable difference on purchased credit deteriorated loans and the Firm's election to recognize the reserve for uncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in the allowance, both of which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans. Securities Financing Agreements As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. The difference between their carrying amount and fair value was immaterial and was recorded as part of the Firm’s cumulative-effect adjustment. Refer to Note 11 for further information. Investment securities Upon adoption, HTM securities are presented net of an allowance for credit losses. The guidance also amended the previous other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance. Refer to Note 10 for further information. Credit quality disclosures As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm expanded credit quality disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost particularly within the retained loan portfolios. Refer to Note 12 for further information. PCD loans The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm recognized the nonaccretable difference on PCD loans in the allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans. PCD loans are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies and are now reported in the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio’s residential real estate loan JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 169 class. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Changes in credit portfolio segments and classes In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. The Firm also revised its loan classes. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Accrued interest receivables As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to continue classifying accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, and investment securities in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans and securities, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. Capital transition provisions As permitted under the U.S. capital rules issued by the federal banking agencies in 2019, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020) that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). Refer to Note 27 for further information. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2018 Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several accounting standards resulting in a net decrease of $ 1 8 3 m i l l i o n to retained earnings and a net increase of $ 8 8 m i l l i o n to AOCI. The adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance resulted in $ 5 0 5 m i l l i o n of fair value gains in the first quarter of 2018, recorded in total net revenue, on certain equity investments that were previously held at cost.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below. The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s VCG, which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. The VGF is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk- taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid- offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size. • Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 171 that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 188 of this Note for more information on such adjustments. Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. Valuation hierarchy A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Notes to consolidated financial statements 172 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Securities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2 • Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below for further information. • Market rates for the respective maturity • Collateral characteristics Loans and lending-related commitments — wholesale Loans carried at fair value (trading loans and non-trading loans) and associated lending-related commitments Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent) • Relevant broker quotes • Observed market prices for similar instruments Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following: • Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating • Prepayment speed • Collateral characteristics Loans — consumer Loans carried at fair value — conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold Fair value is based on observable prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity. Predominantly level 2 Investment and trading securities Quoted market prices Level 1 In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observable market prices for similar securities • Relevant broker quotes • Discounted cash flows In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products: Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity • Credit spreads • Credit rating data Physical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data. Level 1 or 2 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 173 Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives that are actively traded and valued using the exchange price. Level 1 Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as considering the contractual terms. The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices, commodity prices, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, v o l a t i l i t i e s , c o r r e l a t i o n s , C D S s p r e a d s a n d r e c o v e r y r a t e s . A d d i t i o n a l l y , the credit quality of the counterparty and of the Firm as well as market funding levels may also be considered. Level 2 or 3 In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows: Structured credit derivatives specific inputs include: • CDS spreads and recovery rates • Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments Equity option specific inputs include: • Forward equity price • Equity volatility • Equity correlation • Equity-FX correlation • Equity-IR correlation Interest rate and FX exotic options specific inputs include: • Interest rate volatility • Interest rate spread volatility • Interest rate correlation • Foreign exchange correlation • Interest rate-FX correlation Commodity derivatives specific inputs include: • Commodity volatility • Forward commodity price • Commodity correlation Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 188 of this Note. Mortgage servicing rights Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15. Level 3 Private equity direct investments Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of potential inputs include: Level 2 or 3 • Transaction prices • Trading multiples of comparable public companies • Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company • Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are not identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific issues and lack of liquidity. • Additional available inputs relevant to the investment. Fund investments (e.g., mutual/collective investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and real estate funds) Net asset value • NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV level. Level 1 • Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption (e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where observable activity is limited. Level 2 or 3(a) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs Valued using observable market information, where available. Level 2 or 3 In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE. (a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. Notes to consolidated financial statements 174 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classification in the valuation hierarchy Structured notes (included in deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt) • Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note. • The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 188 of this Note.

e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $117.6 billion and $104.5 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related. (b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 177 discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $670 million and $684 million, respectively. Included in these balances at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, were trading assets of $52 million and $54 million, respectively, and other assets of $618 million and $630 million, respectively. (f) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, included within loans were $15.1 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.3 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $8.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively. (g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Notes to consolidated financial statements 178 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Level 3 valuations The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 171-175 of this Note for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price- based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. (h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price. (i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used. Notes to consolidated financial statements 180 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market- making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument- specific factors. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 181 Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, 2019 and 2018. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk- manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 187 Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary. The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Credit and funding adjustments: Derivatives CVA $ (337) $ 241 $ 193 Derivatives FVA (64) 199 (74) Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 186 in this Note and Note 24 for further information. Notes to consolidated financial statements 188 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The following tables present the assets and liabilities held as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

Of the $979 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2020, $535 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. (b) There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2019. (c) Primarily includes certain mortgage loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 189 Equity securities without readily determinable fair values The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 were $708 million. (c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 were $(430) million. (d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B common shares, recorded at a nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6228 at December 31, 2020, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments. The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 173 of this Note for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 191 Note 3 – Fair value option The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending- related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value Notes to consolidated financial statements 192 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table. 2020 2019 2018 December 31, (in millions) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(f) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(f) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(f) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 12 $ — $ 12 $ (36) $ — $ (36) $ (35) $ — $ (35) Securities borrowed 143 — 143 133 — 133 22 — 22 Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans 1,546 (1) (d) 1,545 2,482 (1) (d) 2,481 (1,680) 1 (d) (1,679) Loans reported as trading assets: Changes in instrument- specific credit risk(a) 135 — 135 248 — 248 15 — 15 Other changes in fair value(a) (19) — (19) (1) — (1) 28 — 28 Loans: Changes in instrument-specific credit risk(a) 190 7 (d) 197 475 2 (d) 477 385 1 (d) 386 Other changes in fair value(a) 470 3,239 (d) 3,709 267 1,224 (d) 1,491 138 185 (d) 323 Other assets(a) 103 (65) (e) 38 8 6 (e) 14 11 (45) (e) (34) Deposits(b) (726) — (726) (1,730) — (1,730) 181 — 181 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements (6) — (6) (8) — (8) 11 — 11 Short-term borrowings(b) 294 — 294 (693) — (693) 862 — 862 Trading liabilities 2 — 2 6 — 6 1 — 1 Other liabilities (94) — (94) (16) — (16) — — — Long-term debt(b)(c) (2,120) (1) (d) (2,121) (6,173) 1 (d) (6,172) 2,695 — 2,695 (a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (b) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI and subsequently recorded in principal transactions revenue when realized. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were $20 million for the year ended December 31,2020 and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. (c) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (d) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (e) Reported in other income. (f) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense. Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 193 Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. 2020 2019 December 31, (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Loans Nonaccrual loans Loans reported as trading assets(a) $ 3,386 $ 555 $ (2,831) $ 2,563 $ 234 $ (2,329) Loans(a) 1,867 1,507 (360) 964 696 (268) Subtotal 5,253 2,062 (3,191) 3,527 930 (2,597) 90 or more days past due and government guaranteed(b) Loans reported as trading assets — — — — — — Loans 328 317 (11) 138 129 (9) Subtotal 328 317 (11) 138 129 (9) All other performing loans(c) Loans reported as trading assets(a) 7,917 6,439 (1,478) 8,288 6,779 (1,509) Loans(a) 42,022 42,650 628 43,955 44,130 175 Subtotal 49,939 49,089 (850) 52,243 50,909 (1,334) Total loans $ 55,520 $ 51,468 $ (4,052) $ 55,908 $ 51,968 $ (3,940) Long-term debt Principal-protected debt $ 40,560 (e) $ 40,526 $ (34) $ 40,124 (e) $ 39,246 $ (878) Nonprincipal-protected debt(d) NA 36,291 NA NA 36,499 NA Total long-term debt NA $ 76,817 NA NA $ 75,745 NA Long-term beneficial interests Nonprincipal-protected debt(d) NA $ 41 NA NA $ 36 NA Total long-term beneficial interests NA $ 41 NA NA $ 36 NA (a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (b) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. (c) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. (d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $18.1 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(39) million and $(120) million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses. Notes to consolidated financial statements 196 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. The wholesale industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) The industry rankings presented in the table as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 1 9, are based on the industry rankings of the corresponding exposures at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, not actual rankings of such exposures at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 1 9. (c) Individuals and Individual Entities predominantly consists of Wealth Management clients within AWM and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts. (d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, noted above, the Firm held: $7.2 billion and $6.5 billion , respectively, of trading assets; $20.4 billion and $29.8 billion , respectively, of AFS securities; and $12.8 billion and $4.8 billion , respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments. Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for further information. (e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 92% and 8%, respectively, at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 90% and 10%, respectively, at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 1 9 . Refer to Note 14 for more information on exposures to SPEs. (f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $516.9 billion and $254.0 billion, at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks. (h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables. (i) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans, which resulted in a corresponding reclassification of certain off-balance sheet commitments. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (j) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, included $ 1 9 . 2 b i l l i o n of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans. (k) Represents lending-related financial instruments. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 197 Note 5 – Derivative instruments Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market- making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 209-211 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 209 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 206-208 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 202-209 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes. Notes to consolidated financial statements 198 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Derivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. Notes to consolidated financial statements 202 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of liquid s e c u r i t i e s a n d o t h e r c a s h c o l l a t e r a l h e l d a t t h i r d - p a r t y c u s t o d i a n s , w h i c h a r e s h o w n separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. Liquid securities represent high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below. 2020 2019 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative receivables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 367,056 $ (337,451) $ 29,605 $ 299,205 $ (276,255) $ 22,950 OTC–cleared 18,340 (17,919) 421 9,442 (9,360) 82 Exchange-traded(a) 554 (395) 159 347 (258) 89 Total interest rate contracts 385,950 (355,765) 30,185 308,994 (285,873) 23,121 Credit contracts: OTC 9,052 (8,514) 538 10,743 (10,317) 426 OTC–cleared 4,326 (4,309) 17 3,864 (3,858) 6 Total credit contracts 13,378 (12,823) 555 14,607 (14,175) 432 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 201,349 (189,655) 11,694 136,252 (129,324) 6,928 OTC–cleared 834 (819) 15 185 (152) 33 Exchange-traded(a) 35 (5) 30 10 (6) 4 Total foreign exchange contracts 202,218 (190,479) 11,739 136,447 (129,482) 6,965 Equity contracts: OTC 34,030 (27,374) 6,656 23,106 (20,820) 2,286 Exchange-traded(a) 28,294 (26,751) 1,543 19,654 (18,430) 1,224 Total equity contracts 62,324 (54,125) 8,199 42,760 (39,250) 3,510 Commodity contracts: OTC 10,924 (7,901) 3,023 7,093 (5,149) 1,944 OTC–cleared 20 (20) — 28 (28) — Exchange-traded(a) 6,833 (6,811) 22 6,154 (5,903) 251 Total commodity contracts 17,777 (14,732) 3,045 13,275 (11,080) 2,195 Derivative receivables with appropriate legal opinion 681,647 (627,924) 53,723 (d) 516,083 (479,860) 36,223 (d) Derivative receivables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 25,907 25,907 13,543 13,543 Total derivative receivables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 707,554 $ 79,630 $ 529,626 $ 49,766 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c) (14,806) (13,052) Net amounts $ 64,824 $ 36,714 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 203 2020 2019 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative payables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 331,854 $ (320,780) $ 11,074 $ 267,311 $ (260,229) $ 7,082 OTC–cleared 19,710 (19,494) 216 10,217 (10,138) 79 Exchange-traded(a) 358 (341) 17 365 (303) 62 Total interest rate contracts 351,922 (340,615) 11,307 277,893 (270,670) 7,223 Credit contracts: OTC 10,671 (9,141) 1,530 11,570 (10,080) 1,490 OTC–cleared 4,075 (4,056) 19 3,390 (3,389) 1 Total credit contracts 14,746 (13,197) 1,549 14,960 (13,469) 1,491 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 210,803 (193,672) 17,131 142,360 (131,792) 10,568 OTC–cleared 836 (819) 17 186 (152) 34 Exchange-traded(a) 34 (2) 32 12 (6) 6 Total foreign exchange contracts 211,673 (194,493) 17,180 142,558 (131,950) 10,608 Equity contracts: OTC 35,330 (28,763) 6,567 27,594 (21,778) 5,816 Exchange-traded(a) 34,491 (26,752) 7,739 20,216 (18,426) 1,790 Total equity contracts 69,821 (55,515) 14,306 47,810 (40,204) 7,606 Commodity contracts: OTC 10,365 (7,544) 2,821 8,714 (6,235) 2,479 OTC–cleared 32 (32) — 30 (30) — Exchange-traded(a) 7,391 (6,868) 523 6,012 (5,862) 150 Total commodity contracts 17,788 (14,444) 3,344 14,756 (12,127) 2,629 Derivative payables with appropriate legal opinion 665,950 (618,264) 47,686 (d) 497,977 (468,420) 29,557 (d) Derivative payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 22,937 22,937 14,151 14,151 Total derivative payables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 688,887 $ 70,623 $ 512,128 $ 43,708 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c) (11,964) (6,960) Net amounts $ 58,659 $ 36,748 (a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.

For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm refined its approach for disclosing additional collateral held by the Firm that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $88.0 billion and $65.9 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $78.4 billion and $54.4 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. Notes to consolidated financial statements 204 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables. While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 27,712 $ 14,819 Collateral posted 26,289 13,329 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives 2020 2019 December 31, (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 119 $ 1,243 $ 189 $ 1,467 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 153 2,449 104 1,398 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019.

Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. (f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross- currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 1 4 . 5 b i l l i o n and $ 1 4 . 9 b i l l i o n, respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 6 . 6 b i l l i o n and $ 2 . 8 b i l l i o n, respectively. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 10 for additional information. (d) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships. (e) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 207 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $818 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been t e r m i n a t e d , t h e m a x i m u m l e n g t h o f t i m e o v e r w h i c h t h e d e r i v a t i v e r e s u l t s r e c o r d e d i n A O C I w i l l b e r e c o g n i z e d i n e a r n i n g s i s approximately nine years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018. 2020 2019 2018 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Foreign exchange derivatives $(122) $(1,408) $72 $64 $11 $1,219 (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 209 Credit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes. Notes to consolidated financial statements 210 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 211 Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense Noninterest revenue The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known. Investment banking fees This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The following table presents the components of investment banking fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Underwriting Equity $ 2,759 $ 1,648 $ 1,684 Debt 4,362 3,513 3,347 Total underwriting 7,121 5,161 5,031 Advisory 2,365 2,340 2,519 Total investment banking fees $ 9,486 $ 7,501 $ 7,550 Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results. Principal transactions Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including: • the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to t h e F i r m and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and • realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments. – Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments. – Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to: • derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk. Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities in CIB and cash deployment activities in T r e a s u r y a n d C I O . Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.

(c) The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Principal transactions revenue is earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results. Lending- and deposit-related fees Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Deposit- related fees include fees earned from providing overdraft and other deposit account services, and from performing cash management activities. Lending- and deposit-related fees in this revenue category are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. The following table presents the components of lending- and deposit-related fees. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Lending-related fees $ 1,271 $ 1,184 $ 1,117 Deposit-related fees(a) 5,240 5,442 5,260 Total lending- and deposit-related fees $ 6,511 $ 6,626 $ 6,377 (a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, CB, and AWM. Refer to Note 32 for segment results. Asset management, administration and commissions This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services and other products. The Firm manages assets on behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset management activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service providers are generally recorded in professional and outside services expense. The following table presents the components of Firmwide asset management, administration and commissions. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Asset management fees Investment management fees(a) $ 11,694 $ 10,865 $ 10,768 All other asset management fees(b) 338 315 270 Total asset management fees 12,032 11,180 11,038 Total administration fees(c) 2,249 2,197 2,179 Commissions and other fees Brokerage commissions(d) 2,959 2,439 2,505 All other commissions and fees(e) 937 1,092 1,071 Total commissions and fees 3,896 3,531 3,576 Total asset management, administration and commissions $ 18,177 $ 16,908 $ 16,793 (a) Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firm’s clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. (b) Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/or investor redemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the fund or upon investor redemption. (c) Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds services and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period in which the related service is provided. (d) Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net against commission revenue. (e) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Asset management, administration and commissions are earned primarily by AWM, CIB and CCB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results. Mortgage fees and related income This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending net production and net mortgage servicing revenue. Net production revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option. Net mortgage JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 213 servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies. Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activities and MSRs. Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income. Card income This revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction- related costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income. Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co- brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co- brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co- brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years. The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned. The following table presents the components of card income: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Interchange and merchant processing income $ 18,563 $ 20,370 $ 18,808 Reward costs and partner payments(a) (13,637) (14,540) (13,320) (c) Other card income(b) (491) (754) (745) Total card income $ 4,435 $ 5,076 $ 4,743 (a) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend- based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (b) Predominantly represents the amortization of account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. (c) Includes an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million, recorded in the second quarter of 2018. Card income is earned primarily by CCB, CIB and CB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results. Refer to Note 18 for information on operating lease income included within other income.

(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (c) Represents securities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. (d) Negative interest income is related to the impact of current interest rates combined with the fees paid on client-driven securities borrowed balances. The negative interest expense related to prime brokerage customer payables is recognized in interest expense and reported within trading liabilities - debt and all other interest-bearing liabilities. (e) Includes interest earned on brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables, which are classified in accrued interest and accounts receivable, and all other interest-earning assets, which are classified in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (f) Includes commercial paper. (g) All other interest-bearing liabilities includes interest expense on brokerage-related customer payables. Interest income and interest expense includes the current- period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Refer to Notes 12, 10, 11 and 20, for further information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to loans, investment securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities loaned) and long-term debt, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 215 Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. is a qualified noncontributory plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S. employees who were hired prior to December 2, 2017. The Firm has frozen the U.S. defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan Freeze”). Effective as of January 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019 for new hires), new pay credits have been directed to the U.S. defined contribution plan. Interest credits will continue to accrue on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. As a result of the Plan Freeze, a curtailment was triggered and a remeasurement of the U.S. defined benefit pension obligation and plan assets occurred as of November 30, 2018. The plan design change did not have a material impact on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan or the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also has defined benefit pension plans that are offered in certain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It is the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate at this time making any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2021. The 2021 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $50 million, of which $35 million are contractually required. The Firm also has a number of nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that are unfunded. These plans provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain employees. The Firm offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. retirees and postretirement medical benefits to certain qualifying U.S. and U.K. employees. The Firm partially defrays the cost of its U.S. OPEB obligation through corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, certain COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. The Firm has prefunded its U.S. p o s t r e t i r e m e n t b e n e f i t o b l i g a t i o n s . T h e U . K . O P E B p l a n i s u n f u n d e d . Pension and OPEB accounting guidance generally requires that the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation be measured and recorded on the balance sheet. Plans that are overfunded (excess of plan assets over benefit obligation) are recorded in other assets and plans that are underfunded (excess benefit obligation over plan assets) are recorded in other liabilities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI and recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods as discussed in the Gains and losses section of this Note. Additionally, benefits earned during the year are reported in compensation expense; all other components of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 216 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K The following table presents the pretax changes in benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

U.S. defined benefit pension plans As of December 31, 2020 2019 Discount rate 2.50% 3.30% Rate of compensation increase NA NA Interest crediting rate 4.65 4.65 Gains and losses For the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans is currently 37 years and for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net gain was primarily attributable to a market-driven increase in the fair value of plan assets, predominantly offset by a decrease in the discount rate. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 217 The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm’s defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward- looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. Consideration is also given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each plan. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit pension plan was provided by the Firm’s actuaries. This rate was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, the Firm decreased the discount rates used to determine its benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans in light of current market interest rates, which is expected to decrease expense by approximately $64 million in 2021. The 2021 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets is 3.00%. The following table represents the effect of a 25-basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return of 3.00% and discount rate of 2.50%.

The trust- owned assets of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested primarily in fixed income securities. COLI policies used to partially defray the cost of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity and fixed income indices. The investment policies for the assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of each plan. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. Investments held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Additionally, the investments in each of the collective investment funds and/or registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments. As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in ETFs, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $2.7 billion and $3.1 billion, as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 67 million shares of common stock were available for issuance t h r o u g h M a y 2 0 2 2 . T h e L T I P i s t h e o n l y a c t i v e p l a n u n d e r which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three- year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date. There were no material grants of SARs or stock options in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 221 RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2020. RSUs/PSUs SARs/Options Year ended December 31, 2020 Number of units Weighted- average grant date fair value Number of awards Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in thousands, except weighted-average data, and where otherwise stated) Outstanding, January 1 52,239 $ 99.62 5,527 $ 41.36 Granted 17,891 132.17 1 137.80 Exercised or vested (21,502) 96.64 (2,389) 41.40 Forfeited (1,118) 111.59 (4) 122.59 Canceled NA NA (11) 39.33 Outstanding, December 31 47,510 $ 112.85 3,124 $ 41.25 1.4 $ 265,059 Exercisable, December 31 NA NA 3,124 41.25 1.4 265,059 The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, was $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, was $ 1 8 2 m i l l i o n, $503 million and $370 million, respectively. Compensation expense The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee share-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Cost of prior grants of RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 1,101 $ 1,141 $ 1,241 Accrual of estimated costs of share- based awards to be granted in future periods including those to full-career eligible employees 1,350 1,115 1,081 Total noncash compensation expense related to employee share-based incentive plans $ 2,451 $ 2,256 $ 2,322 At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, approximately $664 million ( p r e t a x ) o f c o m p e n s a t i o n e x p e n s e r e l a t e d t o u n v e s t e d awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share- based compensation awards to employees. Tax benefits Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) related to share-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $837 million, $ 8 9 5 m i l l i o n and $ 1 . 1 b i l l i o n, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 222 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 10 – Investment securities Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance, which also amended the AFS securities impairment guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. During 2020, the Firm transferred $164.2 billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $ 5 . 0 b i l l i o n on the securities at the dates of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded at fair value. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 223 The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated. 2020 2019 December 31, (in millions) Amortized cost(e) Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Amortized cost(e) Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Available-for-sale securities Mortgage-backed securities: U.S. GSEs and government agencies(a) $ 110,979 $ 2,372 $ 50 $ 113,301 $ 107,811 $ 2,395 $ 89 $ 110,117 Residential: U.S. 6,246 224 3 6,467 10,223 233 6 10,450 Non-U.S. 3,751 20 5 3,766 2,477 64 1 2,540 Commercial 2,819 71 34 2,856 5,137 64 13 5,188 Total mortgage-backed securities 123,795 2,687 92 126,390 125,648 2,756 109 128,295 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 199,910 2,141 100 201,951 139,162 449 175 139,436 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 18,993 1,404 1 20,396 27,693 2,118 1 29,810 Certificates of deposit — — — — 77 — — 77 Non-U.S. government debt securities 22,587 354 13 22,928 21,427 377 17 21,787 Corporate debt securities 215 4 3 216 823 22 — 845 Asset-backed securities: Collateralized loan obligations 10,055 24 31 10,048 25,038 9 56 24,991 Other 6,174 91 16 6,249 5,438 40 20 5,458 Total available-for-sale securities(b) 381,729 6,705 256 388,178 345,306 5,771 378 350,699 Held-to-maturity securities(c) Mortgage-backed securities: U.S. GSEs and government agencies(a) 107,889 2,968 29 110,828 36,523 1,165 62 37,626 U.S. Residential 4,345 8 30 4,323 — — — — Commercial 2,602 77 — 2,679 — — — — Total mortgage-backed securities 114,836 3,053 59 117,830 36,523 1,165 62 37,626 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 53,184 50 — 53,234 51 — 1 50 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 12,751 519 — 13,270 4,797 299 — 5,096 Asset-backed securities: Collateralized loan obligations 21,050 90 2 21,138 6,169 — — 6,169 Total held-to-maturity securities, net of allowance for credit losses(d) 201,821 3,712 61 205,472 47,540 1,464 63 48,941 Total investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses(d) $ 583,550 $ 10,417 $ 317 $ 593,650 $ 392,846 $ 7,235 $ 441 $ 399,640 (a) Includes AFS U.S. GSE obligations with fair values of $ 6 5 . 8 b i l l i o n and $78.5 billion, and HTM U.S. GSE obligations with amortized cost of $ 8 6 . 3 b i l l i o n and $31.6 billion, at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each exceeded 10% of JPMorgan Chase’s total stockholders’ equity; the amortized cost and fair value of such securities were $95.7 billion and $98.8 billion, and $54.7 billion and $55.8 billion, respectively. (b) There was no allowance for credit losses on AFS securities at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0. (c) The Firm purchased $12.4 billion, $13.4 billion and $9.4 billion of HTM securities for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (d) HTM securities measured at amortized cost are reported net of allowance for credit losses of $78 million at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0. (e) Excludes $ 2 . 1 b i l l i o n and $ 1 . 9 b i l l i o n of accrued interest receivables at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivables for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost. The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the securities. For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security. When assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. Allowance for credit losses Based on its assessment, the Firm did not recognize an allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of January 1, 2020 or D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0. Notes to consolidated financial statements 226 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K HTM securities – credit risk The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance requires management to estimate expected credit losses on HTM securities over the remaining expected life and recognize this estimate as an allowance for credit losses. As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm recognized an allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities of $ 1 0 m i l l i o n as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. Credit quality indicator The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 98% rated at least AA+. Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast. The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security. The application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $78 million as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, reflecting $68 million recognized in the provision for credit losses for the year ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0.

Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. (b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 5 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. Notes to consolidated financial statements 228 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 11 – Securities financing activities JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 229 The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. 2020 December 31, (in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b) Net amounts(c) Assets Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 666,467 $ (370,183) $ 296,284 $ (273,206) $ 23,078 Securities borrowed 193,700 (33,065) 160,635 (115,219) 45,416 Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 578,060 $ (370,183) $ 207,877 $ (191,980) $ 15,897 Securities loaned and other(a) 41,366 (33,065) 8,301 (8,257) 44 2019 December 31, (in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b) Net amounts(c) Assets Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 628,609 $ (379,463) $ 249,146 $ (231,147) (d) $ 17,999 (d) Securities borrowed 166,718 (26,960) 139,758 (104,990) 34,768 Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 555,172 $ (379,463) $ 175,709 $ (151,566) $ 24,143 Securities loaned and other(a) 36,649 (26,960) 9,689 (9,654) 35 (a) Includes securities-for-securities lending agreements of $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, the Firm held $598 million and $743 million, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 231 Note 12 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. Expected losses related to accrued interest on certain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due. Notes to consolidated financial statements 232 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows: • Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government- guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every twelve months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge- off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 233 Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for- sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re- default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance. The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: • they represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or • the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses. Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could delay recognition of foreclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted. Notes to consolidated financial statements 234 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm revised its loan classes. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation: • The consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment’s residential mortgage and home equity loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into a residential real estate class. • Upon adoption of CECL, the Firm elected to discontinue the pool-level accounting for PCI loans and to account for these loans on an individual loan basis. PCI loans are considered PCD loans under CECL and are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies. PCD loans are now reported in the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment’s residential real estate class. • Risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB were reclassified from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment, to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. The remaining scored auto and business banking loans and lending-related commitments have been combined into an auto and other class. • The wholesale portfolio segment’s classes, previously based on the borrower’s primary business activity, have been revised to align with the loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan’s collateral, purpose, and type of borrower. Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale(c) • Residential real estate(a) • Auto and other(b) • Credit card loans • Secured by real estate • Commercial and industrial • Other(d) (a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate. (b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts. (c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. (d) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Wealth Management clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 for more information on SPEs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 235 The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

These amounts were not material as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held- for-sale during the periods indicated. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table. 2020 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 3,474 (b)(c) $ — $ 1,159 $ 4,633 Sales 352 — 17,916 18,268 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale(a) 2,084 787 1,580 4,451 2019 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 1,282 (b)(c) $ — $ 1,291 $ 2,573 Sales 30,474 — 23,445 53,919 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale(a) 9,188 — 2,371 11,559 2018 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 2,543 (b)(c) $ — $ 2,354 $ 4,897 Sales 9,984 — 16,741 26,725 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale(a) 36 — 2,276 2,312 (a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions. (b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (c) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $15.3 billion, $16.6 billion and $18.6 billion for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of loans Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending- related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue was $ ( 4 3 ) m i l l i o n for the year ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 of which $ ( 3 6 ) m i l l i o n was related to loans. Net gains on sales of loans was $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gains and losses on sales of loans was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. Notes to consolidated financial statements 236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Residential real estate $ 225,302 $ 243,317 Auto and other(a) 76,825 51,682 Total retained loans $ 302,127 $ 294,999 (a) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, included $ 1 9 . 2 b i l l i o n of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 237 Residential real estate The following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.

(b) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. (c) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $40 million and $46 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. Approximately 35% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period. Notes to consolidated financial statements 238 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Nonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators The following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential real estate loans.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, approximately 7% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due, respectively. (b) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, nonaccrual loans included $1.6 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing. (c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral- dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative. (d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $161 million and $166 million for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. (e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were also at least 150 days past due and therefore considered collateral- dependent. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. (f) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, these balances included $33 million and $34 million, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. (g) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (h) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available. (j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0. (k) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $76 million and $63 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 239 Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans, where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was $819 million, $490 million and $ 7 3 6 m i l l i o n for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent of modifications The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. (b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, 2019 and 2018. Notes to consolidated financial statements 240 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were 6 years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

(b) All nonaccrual auto and other consumer loans generally have an allowance. Certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to the charge down, the related allowance may be negative. (c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. (d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0. Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019 were not material. Notes to consolidated financial statements 242 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Credit card loan portfolio The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 243 Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long- term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long- term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit. Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except weighted-average data) 2020 2019 2018 Balance of new TDRs(a) $ 818 $ 961 $ 866 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 18.04 % 19.07 % 17.98 % Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 4.64 4.70 5.16 Balance of loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(b) $ 110 $ 148 $ 116 (a) Represents the outstanding balance prior to modification. (b) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Notes to consolidated financial statements 244 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.

The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 247 Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information. JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending- related commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending- related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending- related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans and certain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. • Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, level and type of collateral, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, tenor, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral- dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s Notes to consolidated financial statements 248 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s overarching economic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firm’s models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances. The Firm also considers the impact of other events, such as government unemployment benefits or other stimulus programs, when determining whether adjustments are necessary. The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. Throughout 2020, the Firm made adjustments to its quantitative calculation which placed significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, as a result of continued uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral). The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses for loans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 249 Allowance for credit losses and related information The table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the allowance for credit losses on investment securities. The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD loans. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

As of December 31, 2020, the Firm’s central case reflected U.S. unemployment rates of approximately 7% through the second quarter of 2021 and remaining above 5% until the second half of 2022. This compared with relatively low levels of unemployment of approximately 4% throughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm’s January 1, 2020 central case. Further, while the Firm’s January 1, 2020 central case U.S. GDP forecast reflected a 1.7% expansion in 2020, actual U.S. GDP contracted approximately 2.5% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Firm’s central case assumptions reflect a return to pre-pandemic GDP levels in the fourth quarter of 2021. Due to elevated uncertainty in the near term outlook, driven by the potential for increased infection rates and related lock downs resulting from the pandemic, as well as the prospect that government and other consumer relief measures set to expire may not be extended, the Firm has placed significant weighting on its adverse scenarios. These scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates remaining elevated throughout 2021 and 2022, ending the fourth quarter of 2022 at approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP ending 2022 approximately 0.9% higher than fourth quarter 2019 actual pre-pandemic levels. The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: Assumptions at January 1, 2020 2Q20 4Q20(b) 2Q21 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 3.7% 3.8% 4.0% Cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 0.9% 1.7% 2.4% Assumptions at December 31, 2020 2Q21 4Q21 2Q22 U.S. unemployment rate(a) 6.8% 5.7% 5.1% Cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 (1.9)% 0.6% 2.0% (a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. (b) 4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment rate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20 actual cumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 4Q19 was (2.5%). Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods. Notes to consolidated financial statements 252 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 14 – Variable interest entities Refer to Note 1 on page 167 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs. The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase i s t h e p r i m a r y b e n e f i c i a r y o f t h e s t r u c t u r e ; ( 2 ) t h e V I E i s used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm a s s e t s ; ( 3 ) t h e V I E i s s u e s f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s w i t h t h e JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities. • Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third- party transaction. • Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 258 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties. Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities Credit card securitizations CCB’s Card business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $5.4 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 39% and 50% for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 253 2019. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests. Refer to Securitization activity on page 259 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows associated with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 259-260 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies.

(e) As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, 73% and 63%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $41 million and $72 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $753 million and $575 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 254 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. Refer to the table on page 257 of this Note for more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations. The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. Refer to the table on page 257 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Refer to the table on page 257 of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts. The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Transfers of securities to VIEs U.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 46,123 $ 25,852 $ 15,532 Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re- securitization VIEs during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and retained interests in any such Firm- sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were immaterial. Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re- securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 255 The following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs. Nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 U.S. GSEs and government agencies Interest in VIEs $ 2,631 $ 2,928 As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re- securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re- securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal- specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal- specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal- specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. Refer to page 257 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $13.5 billion and $16.3 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $12.2 billion and $8.9 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party; refer to page 258 of this Note for further information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2020 and 2019. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to Notes to consolidated financial statements 256 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020 and 2019.

(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $5.2 billion and $6.7 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on interest-bearing long-term beneficial interests. (e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 257 VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $24.9 billion and $19.1 billion, of which $8.7 billion and $5.5 billion was unfunded at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, was $6.7 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019 was $10.5 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending- related commitments. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue. Notes to consolidated financial statements 258 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization. 2020 2019 2018 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Residential mortgage(d) Commercial and other(e) Residential mortgage(d) Commercial and other(e) Residential mortgage(d) Commercial and other(e) Principal securitized $ 7,103 $ 6,624 $ 9,957 $ 9,390 $ 6,431 $ 10,159 All cash flows during the period:(a) Proceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments(b)(c) $ 7,321 $ 6,865 $ 10,238 $ 9,544 $ 6,449 $ 10,218 Servicing fees collected 211 1 287 2 319 2 Cash flows received on interests 801 239 507 237 411 301 (a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization- related indemnifications. Refer to Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 259 The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.

(e) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments. December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Consumer & Community Banking(a) $ 31,311 $ 30,133 $ 30,084 Corporate & Investment Bank(a) 7,913 7,901 7,721 Commercial Banking 2,985 2,982 2,860 Asset & Wealth Management(a) 7,039 6,807 6,806 Total goodwill $ 49,248 $ 47,823 $ 47,471 (a) In 2020, goodwill of $ 9 5 9 m i l l i o n was transferred from CCB to CIB and $ 5 1 m i l l i o n from AWM to CCB related to business realignments. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 32 for additional information on these realignments. The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.

For 2019, represents goodwill associated with the acquisition of InstaMed. This goodwill was allocated to CIB, CB and CCB. (b) Primarily relates to foreign currency adjustments. Goodwill impairment testing The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. The adoption of the guidance requires recognition of an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. It eliminated the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated capital is further reviewed periodically and updated as needed. The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts which are reviewed with senior management of the Firm. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. Management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 261 execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Notes to consolidated financial statements 262 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018.

In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. (e) The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 263 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, 2019 and 2018.

(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. December 31, (in millions, except rates) 2020 2019 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate) 14.90 % 11.67 % Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (206) $ (200) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (392) (384) Weighted-average option adjusted spread(a) 7.19 % 7.93 % Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change $ (134) $ (169) Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change (258) (326) (a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. Notes to consolidated financial statements 264 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 16 – Premises and equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term, or estimated useful life of the improvements. JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis.

These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The following tables provide information related to the Firm’s operating leases: December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2020 2019 Right-of-use assets $ 8,006 $ 8,190 Lease liabilities 8,508 8,505 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.7 8.8 Weighted average discount rate 3.48 % 3.68 % Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities - operating cash flows $ 1,626 $ 1,572 Supplemental non-cash information Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 1,350 $ 1,413 Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Rental expense Gross rental expense $ 2,094 $ 2,057 Sublease rental income (166) (184) Net rental expense $ 1,928 $ 1,873 The following table presents future payments under operating leases as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2021 $ 1,606 2022 1,435 2023 1,270 2024 1,123 2025 947 After 2025 3,602 Total future minimum lease payments 9,983 Less: Imputed interest (1,475) Total $ 8,508 In addition to the table above, as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 , the Firm had additional future operating lease commitments of $1.2 billion that were signed but had not yet commenced. These operating leases will commence between 2021 and 2023 with lease terms up to 25 years. Notes to consolidated financial statements 266 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Firm as lessor The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. Generally, the Firm’s lease financings are operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income. On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees. The following table presents the carrying value of assets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance sheets: December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Carrying value of assets subject to operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation $ 21,155 $ 23,587 Accumulated depreciation 6,388 6,121 The following table presents the Firm’s operating lease income and the related depreciation expense on the Consolidated statements of income: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Operating lease income $ 5,539 $ 5,455 $ 4,540 Depreciation expense 4,257 4,157 3,522 The following table presents future receipts under operating leases as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 : Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2021 $ 3,686 2022 2,084 2023 613 2024 52 2025 24 After 2025 34 Total future minimum lease receipts $ 6,493 Notes to consolidated financial statements JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 267 Note 19 – Accounts payable and other liabilities Accounts payable and other liabilities consist of brokerage payables, which include payables to customers and payables related to security purchases that did not settle, as well as other accrued expenses, such as income tax payables, operating lease liabilities, credit card rewards liability, and litigation reserves.

The use of these derivative instruments modifies the Firm’s exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table above. Including the effects of the hedge accounting derivatives, the range of modified rates in effect at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, for total long-term debt was (0.40)% to 7.28%, versus the contractual range of 0.17% to 8.75% presented in the table above. The interest rate ranges shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value. (b) Included long-term debt of $17.2 billion and $32.0 billion secured by assets totaling $166.4 billion and $186.1 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. (c) Included $76.8 billion and $75.7 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. (d) Included $16.1 billion and $14.0 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $45.3 billion and $39.7 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable. (e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $41 million and $36 million accounted for at fair value at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $12.4 billion and $11.1 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. (f) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, long-term debt in the aggregate of $151.3 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments. (g) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2020 is $26.9 billion in 2021, $18.4 billion in 2022, $32.2 billion in 2023, $29.6 billion in 2024 and $17.1 billion in 2025. (h) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 269 The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 2.89% and 3.13% as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020 and 2019, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 1.58% and 3.19% as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $13.8 billion and $14.4 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price. Notes to consolidated financial statements 270 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 21 – Preferred stock At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 272 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 22 – Common stock At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0 billion shares of common stock with a par value of $1 per share. Common shares issued (reissuances from treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total issued – balance at January 1 4,104.9 4,104.9 4,104.9 Treasury – balance at January 1 (1,020.9) (829.1) (679.6) Repurchase (50.0) (213.0) (181.5) Reissuance: Employee benefits and compensation plans 14.2 20.4 21.7 Warrant exercise — — 9.4 Employee stock purchase plans 1.2 0.8 0.9 Total reissuance 15.4 21.2 32.0 Total treasury – balance at December 31 (1,055.5) (1,020.9) (829.1) Outstanding at December 31 3,049.4 3,084.0 3,275.8 There were no warrants to purchase shares of common stock (“Warrants”) outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 as any Warrants that were not exercised on or before October 29, 2018 have expired. On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. The Firm's Board of Directors has authorized a new common share repurchase program for up to $ 3 0 b i l l i o n. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common stock for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018. There were no Warrants repurchased during 2018. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total number of shares of common stock repurchased 50.0 213.0 181.5 Aggregate purchase price of common stock repurchases $ 6,397 $ 24,121 $ 19,983 The authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares —for example, during internal trading blackout periods. As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, approximately 62.1 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 273 Note 23 – Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information. Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018.

(d) The pre-tax amounts are primarily recorded in noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense in the Consolidated statements of income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 276 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 25 – Income taxes JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported. Effective tax rate and expense The following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate. Effective tax rate Year ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increase/(decrease) in tax rate resulting from: U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit 2.5 3.5 4.0 Tax-exempt income (1.6) (1.4) (1.5) Non-U.S. earnings 1.4 1.8 0.6 Business tax credits (6.3) (4.4) (3.5) Tax audit resolutions — (2.3) (0.1) Impact of the TCJA(a) — — (0.7) Other, net 0.7 — 0.5 Effective tax rate 17.7 % 18.2 % 20.3 % (a) Represents changes in the estimates related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 which was completed in 2018. The following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income. Income tax expense/(benefit) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Current income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal $ 5,759 $ 3,284 $ 2,854 Non-U.S. 2,705 2,103 2,077 U.S. state and local 1,793 1,778 1,638 Total current income tax expense/ (benefit) 10,257 7,165 6,569 Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal (3,184) 709 1,359 Non-U.S. (126) 20 (93) U.S. state and local (671) 220 455 Total deferred income tax expense/(benefit) (3,981) 949 1,721 Total income tax expense $ 6,276 $ 8,114 $ 8,290 Total income tax expense includes $72 million, $1.1 billion and $54 million of tax benefits recorded in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, resulting from the resolution of tax audits. Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders’ equity. The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stockholders’ equity resulted in a decrease of $827 million and $862 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an increase of $172 million in 2018. Results from Non-U.S. earnings The following table presents the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income before income tax expense. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. $ 26,904 $ 36,670 $ 33,052 Non-U.S.(a) 8,503 7,875 7,712 Income before income tax expense $ 35,407 $ 44,545 $ 40,764 (a) For purposes of this table, non-U.S. income is defined as income generated from operations located outside the U.S. The Firm will recognize any U.S. income tax expense it may incur on global intangible low tax income as income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 277 Affordable housing tax credits The Firm recognized $1.5 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for each of the three years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $9.7 billion and $8.6 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $3.8 billion and $2.8 billion at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Deferred taxes Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table. December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets Allowance for loan losses $ 7,270 $ 3,400 Employee benefits 1,104 1,039 Accrued expenses and other 3,332 2,767 Non-U.S. operations 849 949 Tax attribute carryforwards 757 605 Gross deferred tax assets 13,312 8,760 Valuation allowance (560) (557) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 12,752 $ 8,203 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation and amortization $ 3,329 $ 2,852 Mortgage servicing rights, net of hedges 2,184 2,354 Leasing transactions 5,124 5,598 Other, net 6,025 4,683 Gross deferred tax liabilities 16,662 15,487 Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets $ (3,910) $ (7,284) JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $757 million at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital loss carryforwards. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were $799 million, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $139 million, FTC carryforwards were $444 million, state and local capital loss carryforwards were $1.1 billion, and other federal tax attributes were $393 million. I f n o t u t i l i z e d , a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will expire between 2022 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2036 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030, and the state and local capital loss c a r r y f o r w a r d s w i l l e x p i r e b e t w e e n 2 0 2 1 a n d 2 0 2 2 . The valuation allowance at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards. Unrecognized tax benefits At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $4.3 billion, $4.0 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of which $3.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits by as much as approximately $300 million. Upon settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result from payment or income statement recognition. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 B a l a n c e a t J a n u a r y 1 , $ 4,024 $ 4,861 $ 4,747 Increases based on tax positions related to the current period 685 871 980 Increases based on tax positions related to prior periods 362 10 649 Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods (705) (706) (1,249) Decreases related to cash settlements with taxing authorities (116) (1,012) (266) Balance at December 31, $ 4,250 $ 4,024 $ 4,861 After-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $147 million, $(52) million and $192 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, in addition to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $966 million and $817 million, respectively, for income tax- related interest and penalties. Notes to consolidated financial statements 278 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Tax examination status JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of significant income tax examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2020. Periods under examination Status JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2009 – 2013 Field examination of amended returns JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2014 - 2016 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York State 2012 - 2014 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York City 2012 - 2014 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – California 2011 – 2012 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – U.K. 2006 – 2018 Field examination of certain select entities JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 279 Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted assets and intercompany funds transfers Restricted cash and other restricted assets Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits. The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks. The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealers (principally J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in the U.S and J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the U.K.) are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s restricted cash: December 31, (in billions) 2020 2019 Cash reserves – Federal Reserve Banks(a) $ — $ 26.6 Segregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers 19.3 16.0 Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes 5.1 3.9 Total restricted cash(b) $ 24.4 $ 46.5 (a) Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve eliminated reserve requirements for depository institutions (b) Comprises $22.7 billion and $45.3 billion in deposits with banks, and $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance sheets as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 a n d 2 0 1 9 , respectively. A l s o , a s o f D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 a n d 2 0 1 9 , t h e F i r m h a d t h e following other restricted assets: • Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $37.2 billion and $24.7 billion, respectively. • Securities with a fair value of $1.3 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity. Intercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors. At J a n u a r y 1 , 2 0 2 1 , t h e P a r e n t C o m p a n y ’ s b a n k i n g subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $13 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2021 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year. Notes to consolidated financial statements 280 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 27 – Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective minimum capital ratios. The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below: Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators. The following table presents the minimum and well- capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. Standardized Minimum capital ratios Advanced Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios BHC(a)(b)(c) IDI(c)(d) BHC(a)(c) IDI(c)(d) BHC(e) IDI(f) Capital ratios CET1 capital 11.3 % 7.0 % 10.5 % 7.0 % NA 6.5 % Tier 1 capital 12.8 8.5 12.0 8.5 6.0 8.0 Total capital 14.8 10.5 14.0 10.5 10.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 NA 5.0 SLR NA NA 5.0 6.0 NA 6.0 Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios each include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.3% SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the federal banking agencies. (b) For the period ended December 31, 2019, the CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and SLR minimum capital ratios under Basel III Standardized applicable to the Firm were 10.5%, 12.0%, 14.0%, 4.0%, and 5.0%, respectively. (c) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively. (d) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a fixed capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (e) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (f) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. Current Expected Credit Losses Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments – Credit Losses guidance under U.S. GAAP. As permitted under the U.S. capital rules issued by the federal banking agencies in 2019, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020) that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss model during the first two years of the transition period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of the change in the JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 281 allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital, as well as the $ 2 . 7 b i l l i o n day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $ 5 . 7 b i l l i o n, which is the $ 2 . 7 b i l l i o n day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $ 1 2 . 2 b i l l i o n increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance. The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, the capital metrics are presented applying the CECL capital transition provisions. As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not elected to apply this exclusion. (c) As of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, the capital metrics for the Firm reflect the exclusion of assets purchased from money market mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF. Additionally, loans originated under the PPP for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. receive a zero percent risk weight. Notes to consolidated financial statements 282 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, including the impact of the Firm’s adoption of CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 283 In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (e) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans, which resulted in a corresponding reclassification of commitments from Other guarantees and commitments to Wholesale other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (f) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $264.3 billion and $216.2 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies. (g) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses. (h) At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, primarily includes letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis, and unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments. (i) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (j) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative- related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value. Notes to consolidated financial statements 284 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non- contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation. Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 284. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019.

Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 285 Securities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions. The notional value of derivatives guarantees generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount. The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019. (in millions) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Notional amounts Derivative guarantees $ 54,415 $ 53,089 Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 27,752 28,877 Maximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 2,803 2,967 Fair value Derivative payables 322 159 In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled securities financing agreements In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Private label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation. Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk Notes to consolidated financial statements 286 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $889 million and $944 million, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $23 million and $27 million at D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0 and 2019, respectively. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third- party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge- backs. The carrying value of the valuation allowance was $ 1 2 m i l l i o n and $ 1 1 m i l l i o n at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended D e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 0 2 0, 2019 and 2018, Merchant Services processed an aggregate volume of $1,597.3 billion, $1,511.5 billion, and $1,366.1 billion, respectively. Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 287 Exchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another m e m b e r . G e n e r a l l y a p a y m e n t w o u l d o n l y b e r e q u i r e d should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 284. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned and consolidated finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 284 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information. Notes to consolidated financial statements 288 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral Pledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets. December 31, (in billions) 2020 2019 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 166.6 $ 125.2 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 113.9 80.2 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 455.3 478.9 Total pledged assets $ 735.8 $ 684.3 Total pledged assets do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt. The significant components of the Firm’s pledged assets were as follows. December 31, (in billions) 2020 2019 Investment securities $ 80.2 $ 35.9 Loans 420.5 460.4 Trading assets and other 235.1 188.0 Total pledged assets $ 735.8 $ 684.3 Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales, and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. December 31, (in billions) 2020 2019 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,451.7 $ 1,282.5 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,038.9 1,000.5 (a) (a) Includes collateral repledged to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s open market operations. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 289 Note 30 – Litigation Contingencies As of December 31, 2020, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Advisory and Other Activities. In November 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a resolution with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regarding historical deficiencies in internal controls and internal audit for certain fiduciary activities. In connection with the resolution, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid a $ 2 5 0 m i l l i o n Civil Money Penalty. The OCC found that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has remediated the deficiencies that led to the penalty. Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali G r o u p ( “ A m r a p a l i ” ) . I n 2 0 1 7 , n u m e r o u s c r e d i t o r s f i l e d c i v i l claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $ 2 5 m i l l i o n held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and c o o p e r a t i n g w i t h t h e i n v e s t i g a t i o n . Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on Notes to consolidated financial statements 290 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten- year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions also remain pending in the District Court. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of a class action filed by purported indirect purchasers for a total of $ 1 0 m i l l i o n. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 291 changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has resolved certain of these actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other plaintiffs. In the consolidated putative class action related to the time period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SIBOR”), and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and one of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class actions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending. In addition to the actions pending or consolidated in the Southern District of New York, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/ or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 9 2 0 m i l l i o n. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In addition, several putative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in October 2020 and set a deadline of February 2021 for the filing of a consolidated complaint. Two putative class action complaints have also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced investigations. Plaintiffs have filed a stipulation seeking consolidation of the actions and the appointment of co-lead plaintiffs and counsel, which is pending Court approval. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an Notes to consolidated financial statements 292 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $1.1 billion, $239 million and $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 293 Note 31 – International operations The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32. The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions) Revenue(c) Expense(d) Income before income tax expense Net income Total assets 2020 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 16,566 $ 10,987 $ 5,579 $ 3,868 $ 530,687 (e) Asia-Pacific 9,289 5,558 3,731 2,630 252,553 Latin America/Caribbean 2,740 1,590 1,150 837 61,980 Total international 28,595 18,135 10,460 7,335 845,220 North America(a) 90,948 66,001 24,947 21,796 2,540,851 Total $ 119,543 $ 84,136 $ 35,407 $ 29,131 $ 3,386,071 2019(b) Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 15,887 $ 9,860 $ 6,027 $ 4,158 $ 391,369 (e) Asia-Pacific 7,254 5,060 2,194 1,467 183,023 Latin America/Caribbean 2,405 1,561 844 609 47,820 Total international 25,546 16,481 9,065 6,234 622,212 North America(a) 89,853 54,373 35,480 30,197 2,065,167 Total $ 115,399 $ 70,854 $ 44,545 $ 36,431 $ 2,687,379 2018(b) Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 16,459 $ 10,032 $ 6,427 $ 4,569 $ 424,935 (e) Asia-Pacific 6,991 4,884 2,107 1,481 171,547 Latin America/Caribbean 2,365 1,301 1,064 744 43,871 Total international 25,815 16,217 9,598 6,794 640,353 North America(a) 82,968 51,802 31,166 25,680 1,982,179 Total $ 108,783 $ 68,019 $ 40,764 $ 32,474 $ 2,622,532 (a) Substantially reflects the U.S. (b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 295 Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs. Business segment capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. The assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change from time to t i m e . Business segment changes In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm transferred certain assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and headcount associated with certain wealth management clients from AWM to the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management business unit within CCB. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the transfer of approximately 1,650 technology and support staff during the second and third quarters of 2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and certain high-net-worth client relationships remained in AWM. In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises: • Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB • Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB. In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business are reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB. Payment processing-only clients are those that only use payment services offered by Merchant Services, and in general do not currently utilize other services offered by the Firm. Prior-period amounts have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 300–304 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental. 2020 versus 2019 2019 versus 2018 (Unaudited) Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Year ended December 31, (On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) Volume Rate Net change Volume Rate Net change Interest-earning assets Deposits with banks: U.S. $ 333 $ (3,153) $ (2,820) $ (3,030) $ 915 $ (2,115) Non-U.S. (8) (310) (318) 35 60 95 Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements: U.S. (83) (2,644) (2,727) 1,304 337 1,641 Non-U.S. 81 (1,064) (983) 168 518 686 Securities borrowed:(a) U.S. (24) (1,704) (1,728) 236 362 598 Non-U.S. (1) (147) (148) 2 61 63 Trading assets – debt instruments:(b) U.S. 365 (1,466) (1,101) 2,416 (488) 1,928 Non-U.S. 336 (555) (219) 253 (198) 55 Investment securities: U.S. 3,426 (3,686) (260) 2,723 (703) 2,020 Non-U.S. 38 (115) (77) (79) 36 (43) Loans:(b) U.S. 557 (7,907) (7,350) 890 1,941 2,831 Non-U.S. 74 (850) (776) (122) 95 (27) All other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S.(b) 324 (1,447) (1,123) 48 63 111 Change in interest income 5,418 (25,048) (19,630) 4,844 2,999 7,843 Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing deposits: U.S. 495 (5,103) (4,608) 407 1,927 2,334 Non-U.S. 25 (2,017) (1,992) 165 485 650 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements: U.S. 176 (3,302) (3,126) 1,133 294 1,427 Non-U.S. (51) (395) (446) (85) 222 137 Trading liabilities – debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing liabilities: (a)(c) U.S. 2 (2,606) (2,604) (5) 354 349 Non-U.S. 36 (698) (662) 30 (77) (47) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly U.S. (37) (317) (354) 37 38 75 Long-term debt: U.S. 131 (3,193) (3,062) 93 719 812 Non-U.S. 6 13 19 17 — 17 Intercompany funding: U.S. (89) 249 160 293 (961) (668) Non-U.S. 89 (249) (160) (293) 961 668 Change in interest expense 783 (17,618) (16,835) 1,792 3,962 5,754 Change in net interest income $ 4,635 $ (7,430) $ (2,795) $ 3,052 $ (963) $ 2,089 (a) Negative interest income and yield are related to the impact of current interest rates combined with the fees paid on client-driven securities borrowed balances.

Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions. Credit cycle: A period of time over which credit quality improves, deteriorates and then improves again (or vice versa). The duration of a credit cycle can vary from a couple of years to several years. Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap. ERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 EPS: Earnings per share ETD: “Exchange-traded derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.

Examples of volume- and revenue-related expenses include commissions and incentive compensation, depreciation expense related to operating lease assets, and brokerage expense related to equities trading transaction volume. • Investments include expenses associated with supporting medium- to longer-term strategic plans of the Firm. Examples of investments include initiatives in technology (including related compensation), marketing, and compensation for new bankers and client advisors. • Structural expenses are those associated with the day- today cost of running the bank and are expenses not covered by the above two categories. Examples of structural expenses include employee salaries and benefits, as well as noncompensation costs such as real estate and all other expenses.

LTIP: Long-term incentive plan LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Glossary of Terms and Acronyms JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 307 MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties. Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm. Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies. Net production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms 308 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option. Net revenue rate: Represents Credit Card net revenue (annualized) expressed as a percentage of average loans for the period. Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NFA: National Futures Association NM: Not meaningful NOL: Net operating loss Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property. NOW: Negotiable Order of Withdrawal NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio OAS: Option-adjusted spread OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss) OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairment Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: Represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCA: Prompt corrective action PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm. PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represented certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit- impaired on the acquisition date. The superseded FASB guidance allowed purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans had common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool was then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PD: Probability of default PDCF: Primary Dealer Credit Facility PPP: Paycheck Protection Program PPPL Facility: Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Pretax margin: Represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which management evaluates the performance of AWM against the performance of their respective competitors. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including: • the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to Glossary of Terms and Acronyms JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K 309 sell an instrument to t h e F i r m and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and • realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments. – Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments. – Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities. Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to: • derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk; • derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk. PSUs: Performance share units REIT: “Real estate investment trust”: A special purpose investment vehicle that provides investors with the ability to participate directly in the ownership or financing of real- estate related assets by pooling their capital to purchase and manage income property (i.e., equity REIT) and/or mortgage loans (i.e., mortgage REIT). REITs can be publicly or privately held and they also qualify for certain favorable tax considerations. Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. REO: Real estate owned Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e., excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). Revenue wallet: Proportion of fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic, a third-party provider of investment banking competitive analysis and volume-based league tables for the above noted industry products. RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Risk-rated portfolio: Credit loss estimates are based on estimates of the probability of default (“PD”) and loss severity given a default. The probability of default is the likelihood that a borrower will default on its obligation; the loss given default (“LGD”) is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. ROA: Return on assets ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity ROU assets: Right-of-use assets RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. S&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 Index SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights SCB: Stress Capital Buffer Scored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that predominantly include residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans to individuals and certain small business loans. SEC: Securities and Exchange Commission Securities financing agreements: Include resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record.

Structured notes: Structured notes are financial instruments whose cash flows are linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, or other market variables. The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates or indexes. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting results on a managed basis, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax- equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in managed basis results on a level comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. TBVPS: Tangible book value per share TCE: Tangible common equity TDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.
