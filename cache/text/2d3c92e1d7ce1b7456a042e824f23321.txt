(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) for the second quarter of 2018. This Form 10-Q should be read together with JPMorgan Chase’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“2017 Annual Report” or “2017 Form 10-K”), to which reference is hereby made, and which is referred to throughout this document. Refer to the Glossary of terms and acronyms and line of business metrics on pages 172–179 for definitions of terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-Q. The MD&A included in this Form 10-Q contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties, refer to Forward-looking Statements on page 83 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 8–26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase & Co., a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (“U.S.”), with operations worldwide; the Firm had $2.6 trillion in assets and $257.5 billion in stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2018. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients. JPMorgan Chase’s principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 23 states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (“Chase Bank USA, N.A.”), a national banking association that is the Firm’s principal credit card-issuing bank. JPMorgan Chase’s principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan Securities”), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, and representative offices. The Firm’s principal operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. For management reporting purposes, the Firm’s activities are organized into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate segment. The Firm’s consumer business segment is the Consumer & Community Banking (“CCB”). The Firm’s wholesale business segments are Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”), Commercial Banking (“CB”), and Asset & Wealth Management (“AWM”). For a description of the Firm’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases, refer to Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Form 10-K. 5 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW This executive overview of the MD&A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to readers of this Form 10-Q. For a complete description of the trends and uncertainties, as well as the risks and critical accounting estimates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business, this Form 10-Q and and the 2017 Form 10-K should be read in their entirety. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards, of which the most significant to the Firm are the guidance related to revenue recognition, and recognition and measurement of financial assets. The revenue recognition guidance required gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, resulting in both total net revenue and total noninterest expense increasing with no impact to net income. The adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance resulted in $505 million of fair value gains, which were recorded in total net revenue in the first quarter of 2018, on certain equity investments that were previously held at cost. For additional information, refer to Note 1.

(b) The prior period ratios have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 6 Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported strong results in the second quarter of 2018 with record net income of $8.3 billion, or $2.29 per share, on net revenue of $27.8 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 14% and ROTCE of 17%. • Net income increased 18%, reflecting higher net revenue and the impact of the lower U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Acts (“TCJA”), partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. • Total net revenue increased 8%. Net interest income was $13.5 billion, up 10%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income. Noninterest revenue was $14.3 billion, up 6%, driven by higher Markets revenue, investment banking fees and auto lease income, partially offset by lower Card net interchange income. Card net interchange income includes a rewards liability adjustment of approximately $330 million, driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions, partially offset by higher card sales volumes. • Noninterest expense was $16.0 billion, up 8%, driven by higher performance-related compensation expense, investments in technology, auto lease depreciation, volume-related transaction costs, and a loss of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity. • The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, flat compared with the prior year. • The total allowance for credit losses was $14.4 billion at June 30, 2018, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio, excluding the PCI portfolio, of 1.22%, compared with 1.28% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $5.8 billion at June 30, 2018, a decrease from $6.4 billion in the prior year. • Firmwide average core loans increased 6%, and excluding CIB, core loans increased 7%. Selected capital-related metrics • The Firm’s Basel III Fully Phased-In CET1 capital was $185 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.0% and 12.8%, respectively. • The Firm’s fully phased-in SLR was 6.5% at June 30, 2018. • The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending the second quarter of 2018 at $55.14, up 3%. ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. Core loans and each of the Fully Phased-In capital and certain leverage measures are all considered key performance measures. For a further discussion of each of these measures, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 15–17, and Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47. Lines of business highlights Selected business metrics for each of the Firm’s four lines of business are presented below for the second quarter of 2018. CCB ROE 26% • Average core loans up 7%; average deposits up 5% • Client investment assets of $284 billion, up 12% • Credit card sales volume up 11% and merchant processing volume up 12% CIB ROE 17% • #1 Global Investment Banking fees with 8.6% wallet share year-to-date • Markets revenue up 13%, with Equity Markets revenue of $2.0 billion, up 24% • Treasury Services and Securities Services revenue each up 12% CB ROE 21% • Average loan balances up 4% • Strong credit quality with 7 bps net charge-off rate AWM ROE 33% • Average loan balances up 12% • Assets under management (“AUM”) of $2.0 trillion, up 8% For a detailed discussion of results by line of business, refer to the Business Segment Results on pages 18–40. Credit provided and capital raised JPMorgan Chase continues to support consumers, businesses and communities around the globe. The Firm provided credit and raised capital of $1.4 trillion for wholesale and consumer clients during the first six months of 2018: • $114 billion of credit for consumers • $11 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses • $470 billion of credit for corporations • $743 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non- U.S. government entities • $26 billion of credit and capital raised for U.S. government and nonprofit entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. Recent events On June 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2018 capital plan, submitted under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). As a result, the Firm announced that the Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.80 per share (up from the current $0.56 per share), effective the third quarter of 2018 and has authorized gross common equity repurchases of up to $20.7 billion between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 under a new common equity repurchase program. 2018 outlook At this time the Firm is not updating the outlook provided in the first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q. 7 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, unless otherwise specified. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, refer to pages 77–79 of this Form 10-Q and pages 138–140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1. Revenue Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Investment banking fees $ 2,168 $ 1,846 17% $ 3,904 $ 3,726 5% Principal transactions 3,782 3,137 21 7,734 6,719 15 Lending- and deposit-related fees 1,495 1,482 1 2,972 2,930 1 Asset management, administration and commissions 4,304 4,047 6 8,613 7,924 9 Investment securities losses (80) (34) (135) (325) (37) NM Mortgage fees and related income 324 404 (20) 789 810 (3) Card income 1,020 1,167 (13) 2,295 2,081 10 Other income(a) 1,255 1,474 (15) 2,881 2,245 28 Noninterest revenue 14,268 13,523 6 28,863 26,398 9 Net interest income 13,485 12,208 10 26,797 24,272 10 Total net revenue $ 27,753 $ 25,731 8% $ 55,660 $ 50,670 10% (a) Included operating lease income of $1.1 billion and $873 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Quarterly results Investment banking fees increased reflecting higher equity underwriting and advisory fees. The increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO and convertible markets. The increase in advisory fees was driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. For additional information, refer to CIB segment results on pages 25–30 and Note 5. Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting higher client-driven market-making revenue in CIB as a result of strength across products in Equity Markets, predominantly in derivatives and prime brokerage. Fixed Income Markets also recorded solid performance with good client activity. For additional information, refer to CIB segment results on pages 25–30 , and Note 5. For information on lending- and deposit-related fees, refer to the segment results for CCB on pages 20–24, CIB on pages 25–30, CB on pages 31–34 and Note 5. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased reflecting: • higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB driven by net long-term product inflows and higher market levels, partially offset by fee compression in AWM • higher brokerage commissions driven by higher volumes and higher asset-based fees in CIB driven by net client inflows and higher market levels. For additional information, refer to AWM, CCB and CIB segment results on pages 35–38, pages 20–24 and pages 25–30, respectively, and Note 5. Investment securities losses increased primarily due to sales related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. For further information on the investment securities portfolio, refer to the Corporate segment discussion on pages 39–40 and Note 9. Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by lower net production revenue, reflecting lower margins, and lower servicing revenue, partially offset by higher MSR risk management results. For further information, refer to CCB segment results on pages 20–24 and Note 14. Card income decreased driven by: • lower net interchange income reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, partially offset by higher card sales volumes. The rewards costs included an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions the lower net interchange income was largely offset by • lower new account origination costs • higher merchant processing fees reflecting higher merchant processing volumes. For further information, refer to CCB segment results on pages 20–24 and Note 5. 8 Other income reflects: • higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB which was more than offset by • the absence of a $645 million legal benefit in Corporate related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts. For further information, refer to Note 5. Net interest income increased primarily driven by the net impact of higher rates and loan growth across the businesses, partially offset by declines in Markets net interest income in CIB. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.2 trillion, up $45 billion from the prior year, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 2.46%, an increase of 15 basis points from the prior year. Year-to-date results Investment banking fees increased reflecting: • higher advisory and equity underwriting fees in CIB. The increase in advisory fees was driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. The increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO market partially offset by • lower debt underwriting fees primarily driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels and a lower share in leveraged finance. Principal transactions revenue increased primarily reflecting: • higher client-driven market-making revenue in CIB driven by strength across products in Equity Markets, predominantly derivatives and prime brokerage. Fixed Income Markets also recorded strong performance in Commodities and Currencies & Emerging Markets, largely offset by lower revenue in Credit the increase in client-driven market-making revenue in CIB was partially offset by • private equity losses of $45 million compared with gains of $153 million in the prior year on legacy investments in Corporate. Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased reflecting: • higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB driven by net long-term product inflows and higher market levels, partially offset by fee compression in AWM • higher brokerage commissions driven by higher volumes in CIB and AWM, and higher asset-based fees in CIB driven by net client inflows and higher market levels. Investment securities losses increased primarily due to sales related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by lower net production revenue, reflecting lower margins, and lower servicing revenue, predominantly offset by higher MSR risk management results. Card income increased driven by: • lower new account origination costs • higher merchant processing fees reflecting higher merchant processing volumes largely offset by • lower net interchange income reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, largely offset by higher card sales volumes. The rewards costs included an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions. Other income increased reflecting: • fair value gains of $505 million recognized in the first quarter of 2018 related to the adoption of the new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost • higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB partially offset by • the absence of a legal benefit of $645 million in Corporate related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts. Net interest income increased primarily driven by the net impact of higher rates and loan growth across the businesses, partially offset by declines in Markets net interest income in CIB. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.2 trillion, up $44 billion from the prior year, and the net interest yield on these assets, on a FTE basis, was 2.47%, an increase of 15 basis points from the prior year. 9 Provision for credit losses Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Consumer, excluding credit card $ (56) $ 12 NM $ 90 $ 454 (80)% Credit card 1,164 1,387 (16)% 2,334 2,380 (2) Total consumer 1,108 1,399 (21) 2,424 2,834 (14) Wholesale 102 (184) NM (49) (304) 84 Total provision for credit losses $ 1,210 $ 1,215 — % $ 2,375 $ 2,530 (6)% Quarterly results The provision for credit losses was flat as a result of: • a decrease in the consumer provision predominantly reflecting – no addition to the allowance for credit losses in CCB in the current quarter, compared with a net addition in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio – lower net charge-offs, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery from a loan sale, and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, predominantly offset by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations the decrease in the consumer provision was offset by • an increase in the wholesale provision reflecting – a net expense in the current period as a result of net portfolio activity, including new exposures and loan sales, compared with a net benefit in the prior year driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals and Mining portfolios. For a more detailed discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 20–24, CIB on pages 25–30, CB on pages 31–34, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67–69 and Note 12. Year-to-date results The provision for credit losses decreased as a result of: • a lower consumer provision predominantly reflecting – no addition to the allowance for credit losses in CCB in the current year, compared with a net addition in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio partially offset by – higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations. These were largely offset by lower net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery from a loan sale and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies – the prior year included a $218 million write-down recorded in connection with the sale of the student loan portfolio the decrease in the consumer provision was partially offset by • a lower net benefit in the wholesale provision reflecting – a net benefit in the current period, primarily driven by a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio, partially offset by other net portfolio activity, compared with a net benefit in the prior year, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals and Mining portfolios.

(b) Included FDIC-related expense of $368 million and $376 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $751 million and $757 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 10 Quarterly results Compensation expense increased driven by investments in headcount across the businesses, including bankers, advisors and business-related support staff; and higher performance-related compensation expense predominantly in CIB. Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: • higher outside services expense primarily due to higher volume-related transaction costs in CIB and higher external fees on revenue growth in AWM • higher depreciation expense due to growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB • a loss of $174 million recorded in other expense in Corporate on the liquidation of a legal entity • higher investments in technology For additional information on the liquidation of a legal entity, refer to Note 17. Year-to-date results Compensation expense increased driven by investments in headcount across the businesses, including bankers, advisors and business-related support staff, and higher performance-related compensation expense predominantly in CIB. Noncompensation expense increased as a result of: • higher outside services expense primarily due to higher volume-related transaction costs in CIB and higher external fees on revenue growth in AWM • higher depreciation expense due to growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB • a loss of $174 million recorded in other expense in Corporate on the liquidation of a legal entity • higher investments in technology partially offset by • lower legal expense For a discussion of legal expense, refer to Note 22.

The decrease was partially offset by the change in mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes. Year-to-date results The effective tax rate decreased due to the TCJA, including the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as well as a $189 million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2018 resulting from a change in the estimate for the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. The decrease was partially offset by higher pre-tax income, and the change in mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes. 11 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1. Consolidated balance sheets analysis The following is a discussion of the significant changes between June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (in millions) Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Change Assets Cash and due from banks $ 23,680 $ 25,898 (9)% Deposits with banks 381,500 405,406 (6) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 226,505 198,422 14 Securities borrowed 108,246 105,112 3 Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments 360,289 325,321 11 Derivative receivables 58,510 56,523 4 Investment securities 233,015 249,958 (7) Loans 948,414 930,697 2 Allowance for loan losses (13,250) (13,604) (3) Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 935,164 917,093 2 Accrued interest and accounts receivable 75,669 67,729 12 Premises and equipment 14,132 14,159 — Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets 54,535 54,392 — Other assets 118,805 113,587 5 Total assets $ 2,590,050 $ 2,533,600 2% Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a result of net long-term debt maturities and a shift in the deployment of excess cash from deposits with banks into securities purchased under resale agreements. The Firm’s excess cash is largely placed with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve Banks. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased primarily due to higher client activity in CIB and the shift in the deployment of excess cash from deposits with banks into securities purchased under resale agreements. For additional information on the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 48–52. Trading assets-debt and equity instruments increased predominantly as a result of client-driven market-making activities in CIB, primarily debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, and equity instruments in prime brokerage, driven by higher client demand. For additional information, refer to Notes 2 and 4. Investment securities decreased primarily reflecting net sales, paydowns and maturities of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), commercial MBS, and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities. For additional information on Investment securities, refer to Corporate segment results on pages 39–40, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 70, and Notes 2 and 9. Loans increased reflecting: • higher wholesale loans across all lines of business, predominantly driven by CIB, including loans to financial institution and commercial and industrial clients, and in AWM due to higher loans to international and domestic Private Banking clients partially offset by • lower consumer loans driven by the seasonal decline in credit card balances, paydown of home equity loans, run- off of PCI loans, and a mortgage loan sale, predominantly offset by higher retention of high-quality prime mortgages in CCB and AWM. The allowance for loan losses decreased reflecting: • a net reduction in the wholesale allowance primarily in the Oil & Gas portfolio driven by a single name • the consumer allowance was relatively flat. For a detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 53–70, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12. Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased primarily reflecting higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in CIB. Other assets increased largely reflecting higher auto operating lease assets from growth in business volume in CCB. For information on Goodwill and MSRs, refer to Note 14. 12 Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued) (in millions) Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Change Liabilities Deposits $ 1,452,122 $ 1,443,982 1% Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 175,293 158,916 10 Short-term borrowings 63,918 51,802 23 Trading liabilities: Debt and equity instruments 107,327 85,886 25 Derivative payables 42,511 37,777 13 Accounts payable and other liabilities 196,984 189,383 4 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) 21,323 26,081 (18) Long-term debt 273,114 284,080 (4) Total liabilities 2,332,592 2,277,907 2 Stockholders’ equity 257,458 255,693 1 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 2,590,050 $ 2,533,600 2% Deposits increased due to: • higher deposits in the consumer business reflecting the continuation of growth from new and existing customers and low attrition rates in CCB, partially offset by balance migration as customers shift from deposits largely into the Firm’s investment-related products; and in the wholesale business reflecting an increase in CIB’s Treasury Services business driven by growth in client activity partially offset by • lower deposits in the other wholesale businesses primarily driven by the impact of seasonality in CB and AWM, and balance migration in AWM predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products. For more information, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 48–52; and Notes 2 and 15. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements increased reflecting higher secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments, partially offset by a change in the mix of funding to short-term borrowings in CIB. Short-term borrowings increased driven by a change in the mix of funding for CIB activities from securities sold under repurchase agreements to short-term borrowings, and the net issuance of commercial paper. For additional information, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 48–52. Trading liabilities–debt and equity instruments increased predominantly as a result of client-driven market-making activities in CIB, primarily debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, and equity instruments in prime brokerage. For additional information, refer to Note 2 . Trading liabilities–derivative payables increased predominantly as a result of client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets, which increased equity and interest rate derivative payables. For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on pages 65–66, and Notes 2 and 4. Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased due to net maturities of credit card securitizations. For further information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 14 and Notes 13 and 20. Long-term debt decreased primarily driven by lower Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances and net maturities of senior debt. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt activities, refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 48–52. For information on changes in stockholders’ equity, refer to page 87, and on the Firm’s capital actions, refer to Capital actions on pages 46–47. 13 Consolidated cash flows analysis The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. (in millions) Six months ended June 30, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by/(used in) Operating activities $ 576 $ (18,486) Investing activities (38,974) 24,539 Financing activities 13,766 47,911 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1,492) 5,408 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks $ (26,124) $ 59,372 Operating activities • In 2018, cash provided primarily reflected increased trading liabilities-debt and equity instruments and accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by increases in trading assets-debt and equity instruments. • In 2017, cash used primarily reflected increases in trading assets-debt and equity instruments and accrued interest and accounts receivable, and decreases in trading liabilities-derivative payables, and accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in other assets. Investing activities • In 2018, cash used reflected an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements and higher net loans originated, partially offset by lower investment securities. • In 2017, cash provided reflected a decrease in securities purchased under resale agreements and lower investment securities, partially offset by a net increase in loan originations. Financing activities • In 2018, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, short-term borrowings and deposits, partially offset by a decrease in long-term borrowings. • In 2017, cash provided reflected higher deposits, and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in long-term borrowings. • Additionally, for both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and dividends on common and preferred stock. For a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm’s cash flows, refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 11–13, Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 48–52 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 92–97 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 14 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The Firm is involved with several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees. The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct. The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. In addition, refer to Note 1 for information about the Firm’s consolidation policies. Type of off-balance sheet arrangement Location of disclosure Page references Special-purpose entities: variable interests and other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from variable interests in nonconsolidated VIEs Refer to Note 13 145-150 Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments Refer to Note 20 159-162 15 EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES Non-GAAP financial measures The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 84–88. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level, because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, refer to Business Segment Results on pages 18–40. Additionally, certain credit metrics and ratios disclosed by the Firm exclude PCI loans, and are therefore non-GAAP measures. For additional information on these non-GAAP measures, refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 53–70. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The following summary tables provide a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis. Three months ended June 30, 2018 2017 (in millions, except ratios) Reported results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a)(b) Managed basis Reported results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Other income $ 1,255 $ 474 $ 1,729 $ 1,474 $ 596 $ 2,070 Total noninterest revenue 14,268 474 14,742 13,523 596 14,119 Net interest income 13,485 161 13,646 12,208 339 12,547 Total net revenue 27,753 635 28,388 25,731 935 26,666 Pre-provision profit 11,782 635 12,417 10,964 935 11,899 Income before income tax expense 10,572 635 11,207 9,749 935 10,684 Income tax expense $ 2,256 $ 635 $ 2,891 $ 2,720 $ 935 $ 3,655 Overhead ratio 58% NM 56% 57% NM 55% Six months ended June 30, 2018 2017 (in millions, except ratios) Reported results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a)(b) Managed basis Reported results Fully taxable- equivalent adjustments(a) Managed basis Other income $ 2,881 $ 929 $ 3,810 $ 2,245 $ 1,178 $ 3,423 Total noninterest revenue 28,863 929 29,792 26,398 1,178 27,576 Net interest income 26,797 319 27,116 24,272 668 24,940 Total net revenue 55,660 1,248 56,908 50,670 1,846 52,516 Pre-provision profit 23,609 1,248 24,857 20,620 1,846 22,466 Income before income tax expense 21,234 1,248 22,482 18,090 1,846 19,936 Income tax expense $ 4,206 $ 1,248 $ 5,454 $ 4,613 $ 1,846 $ 6,459 Overhead ratio 58% NM 56% 59% NM 57% Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1. (a) Predominantly recognized in CIB and CB business segments and Corporate. (b) The decrease in fully taxable-equivalent adjustments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, reflects the impact of the TCJA. 16 Net interest income excluding CIB’s Markets businesses In addition to reviewing net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews net interest income excluding net interest income arising from CIB’s Markets businesses to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. This net interest income is referred to as non-markets related net interest income. CIB’s Markets businesses are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income provides investors and analysts with another measure by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities. The data presented below are non-GAAP financial measures due to the exclusion of markets-related net interest income arising from CIB.

(c) For further information on CIB’s Markets businesses, refer to page 29. 17 Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE. Period-end Average (in millions, except per share and ratio data) Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Common stockholders’ equity $ 231,390 $ 229,625 $ 228,901 $ 230,200 $ 228,261 $ 228,959 Less: Goodwill 47,488 47,507 47,494 47,290 47,499 47,292 Less: Other intangible assets 806 855 822 838 833 845 Add: Certain Deferred tax liabilities(a)(b) 2,227 2,204 2,221 3,239 2,216 3,234 Tangible common equity $ 185,323 $ 183,467 $ 182,806 $ 185,311 $ 182,145 $ 184,056 Return on tangible common equity NA NA 17% 14% 18% 14% Tangible book value per share $ 55.14 $ 53.56 NA NA NA NA (a) Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE. (b) Includes the effect from the revaluation of the Firm’s net deferred tax liability as a result of the TCJA. Key performance measures The Firm considers the following to be key regulatory capital measures: • Capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), and capital and leverage ratios presented under Basel III Standardized and Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, and • SLR calculated under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules. The Firm, as well as banking regulators, investors and analysts use these measures to assess the Firm’s regulatory capital position and to compare the Firm’s regulatory capital to that of other financial services companies. For additional information on these measures, refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47. Core loans are also considered a key performance measure. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; and exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans is a measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio. 18 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on pages 15–17. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. For further information about line of business capital, refer to Line of business equity on page 46. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on pages 88-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For a further discussion of those methodologies, refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 55–56 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 19 Segment results – managed basis Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1. Net income in 2018 for the business segments reflects the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA.

(a) Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain operations staff were transferred from CCB to CB. The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. For a further discussion of this transfer, refer to CB segment results on page 31. (b) Included operating lease depreciation expense of $827 million and $638 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion for six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $(23) million and $(57) million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $(6) million and $(109) million for six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 21 Quarterly results Net income was $3.4 billion, an increase of 53%. Net revenue was $12.5 billion, an increase of 10%. Net interest income was $8.7 billion, up 13%, driven by: • higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances, and • margin expansion and higher loan balances in Card, partially offset by • loan spread compression from higher rates in Home Lending and Auto, and • the impact of the sale of the student loan portfolio in the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $3.7 billion, up 2%, driven by: • lower new account origination costs in Card, • higher auto lease volume, and • higher MSR risk management results, predominantly offset by • lower net interchange reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, partially offset by higher card sales volumes. The rewards costs included an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions, and • lower net production revenue reflecting lower mortgage production margins. Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Noninterest expense was $6.9 billion, up 6%, driven by: • higher auto lease depreciation, and • investments in technology. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 21% from the prior year, reflecting: • no addition to the allowance for credit losses in the current quarter, compared with a net addition of $250 million in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio, and • lower net charge-offs, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery of approximately $130 million from a loan sale, and reflects continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, predominantly offset by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations. Year-to-date results Net income was $6.7 billion, an increase of 60%. Net revenue was $25.1 billion, an increase of 12%. Net interest income was $17.2 billion, up 12%, driven by: • higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances, and • margin expansion and higher loan balances in Card, partially offset by • loan spread compression from higher rates in Home Lending and Auto, and • the impact of the sale of the student loan portfolio in the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $7.9 billion, up 13%, driven by: • lower new account origination costs in Card, • higher auto lease volume, and • higher MSR risk management results, partially offset by • lower net interchange reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, largely offset by higher card sales volumes. The rewards costs included an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million driven by an increase in redemption rate assumptions, and • lower net production revenue reflecting lower mortgage production margins. Noninterest expense was $13.8 billion, up 7%, driven by: • investments in technology and marketing, • higher auto lease depreciation, and • continued business growth. The provision for credit losses was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 14% from the prior year, reflecting: • no addition to the allowance for credit losses in the current year, compared with a net addition of $250 million in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio partially offset by • higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations. These were largely offset by lower net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery of approximately $130 million from a loan sale, and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies • the prior year included a $218 million write-down recorded in connection with the sale of the student loan portfolio. 22 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except headcount) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Total assets $ 552,674 $ 529,859 4% $ 552,674 $ 529,859 4% Loans: Consumer & Business Banking 26,272 25,044 5 26,272 25,044 5 Home equity 39,033 46,330 (16) 39,033 46,330 (16) Residential mortgage 202,205 189,661 7 202,205 189,661 7 Home Lending 241,238 235,991 2 241,238 235,991 2 Card 145,255 140,141 4 145,255 140,141 4 Auto 65,014 65,627 (1) 65,014 65,627 (1) Student — 75 NM — 75 NM Total loans 477,779 466,878 2 477,779 466,878 2 Core loans 419,295 393,639 7 419,295 393,639 7 Deposits 679,154 648,369 5 679,154 648,369 5 Equity 51,000 51,000 — 51,000 51,000 — Selected balance sheet data (average) Total assets $ 544,642 $ 528,598 3 $ 541,806 $ 530,338 2 Loans: Consumer & Business Banking 26,110 24,725 6 25,978 24,543 6 Home equity 39,898 47,339 (16) 40,836 48,303 (15) Residential mortgage 201,587 187,201 8 200,129 185,489 8 Home Lending 241,485 234,540 3 240,965 233,792 3 Card 142,724 138,132 3 142,825 137,674 4 Auto 65,383 65,474 — 65,622 65,395 — Student — 4,642 NM — 5,772 NM Total loans 475,702 467,513 2 475,390 467,176 2 Core loans 414,120 387,783 7 412,145 384,419 7 Deposits 673,761 639,873 5 666,719 631,441 6 Equity 51,000 51,000 — 51,000 51,000 — Headcount(a) 131,945 135,040 (2)% 131,945 135,040 (2)% (a) Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain operations staff were transferred from CCB to CB.

(b) At June 30, 2018 and 2017, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $3.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. Student loans insured by U.S. government agencies under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) and 90 or more days past due were also excluded from nonaccrual loans prior to sale of the student loan portfolio in 2017. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rates for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, excluded $73 million and $22 million, respectively, and for six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, excluded $93 million and $46 million, respectively, of write-offs in the PCI portfolio. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. For further information on PCI write-offs, refer to Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses on page 68. (d) Excludes the impact of PCI loans. For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the net charge-off/(recovery) rates including the impact of PCI loans were as follows: (1) home equity of (0.07)% and 0.06%, respectively; (2) residential mortgage of (0.30)% and (0.01)%, respectively; (3) Home Lending of (0.26)% and 0.01%, respectively; and (4) total CCB of 0.93% and 0.99%, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the net charge-off/(recovery) rates included impact of PCI loans were as follows: (1) home equity of 0.04% and 0.23%, respectively; (2) residential mortgage of (0.15)% and -%, respectively; (3) Home Lending of (0.12)% and 0.05%, respectively; and (4) total CCB of 1.03% and 1.23%, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards; the guidance which had the most significant impact on the CIB segment results was revenue recognition, and recognition and measurement of financial assets. The revenue recognition guidance was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1.

Results are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. 26 Quarterly results Net income was $3.2 billion, up 18%. Net revenue was $9.9 billion, up 11%. Banking revenue was $3.5 billion, up 9%. Investment banking revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13%, driven by higher equity underwriting and advisory fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. Equity underwriting fees were $570 million, up 49%, driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO and convertible markets. Advisory fees were $626 million, up 24%, driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. Debt underwriting fees were $943 million, flat compared to the prior year. Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 12%, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in deposits. Lending revenue was $321 million, down 14%, predominantly driven by lower net interest income primarily reflecting a change in the portfolio composition and overall spread tightening as well as higher gains in the prior year on securities received from restructurings. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $6.5 billion, up 12%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.5 billion, up 7%. Excluding the reduction of approximately $160 million in tax-equivalent adjustments as a result of the TCJA, Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 12%. Fixed Income Markets reflected solid performance across products with good client activity, and improved Commodities revenue compared to a challenging prior year. Equity Markets revenue was $2.0 billion, up 24%, driven by strength across products, predominantly in derivatives and prime brokerage. Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher interest rates and deposit growth, as well as higher asset-based fees driven by net client inflows and higher market levels. The provision for credit losses was an expense of $58 million, reflecting net portfolio activity, including new exposures and loan sales. The prior year was a benefit of $53 million primarily driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas portfolio. Noninterest expense was $5.4 billion, up 11%, predominantly driven by higher performance-related compensation, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology. Year-to-date results Net income was $7.2 billion, up 21%. Net revenue was $20.4 billion, up 10%. Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, up 3%. Investment banking revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%, driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees, largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. Advisory fees were $1.2 billion, up 20%, driven by a higher number of large completed transactions. Equity underwriting fees were $916 million, up 14%, driven by a higher share of fees, primarily due to strong performance in the IPO market. Debt underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, down 10%, primarily driven by declines in industry-wide fee levels and a lower share in leveraged finance. Treasury Services revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates and growth in deposits. Lending revenue was $623 million, down 18%, driven by lower net interest income primarily reflecting a change in the portfolio composition and overall spread tightening as well as higher gains in the prior year on securities received from restructurings. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $14.0 billion, up 14%. The results included approximately $500 million of fair value gains related to the adoption in the first quarter of 2018 of the new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost, and a reduction of approximately $310 million in tax-equivalent adjustments as a result of the TCJA. Fixed Income Markets revenue was $8.0 billion, up 8%. Excluding the impact of these fair value gains and tax-equivalent adjustments, Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 5%, with strong performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Commodities, largely offset by lower revenue in Credit. Equity Markets revenue was $4.0 billion, up 25%, driven by strength across derivatives, prime brokerage and Cash Equities. Securities Services revenue was $2.2 billion, up 14%, predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates and deposit growth as well as higher asset-based fees driven by net client inflows and higher market levels. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $100 million, primarily driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas portfolio related to a single name, partially offset by net portfolio activity. The prior year was a benefit of $149 million primarily driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas portfolio. Noninterest expense was $11.1 billion, up 10%, largely driven by higher performance-related compensation expense, volume-related transaction costs and investments in technology. 27 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except headcount) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Assets $ 908,954 $ 847,377 7% $ 908,954 $ 847,377 7% Loans: Loans retained(a) 116,645 108,935 7 116,645 108,935 7 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 6,254 7,168 (13) 6,254 7,168 (13) Total loans 122,899 116,103 6 122,899 116,103 6 Core loans 122,574 115,764 6 122,574 115,764 6 Equity 70,000 70,000 — 70,000 70,000 — Selected balance sheet data (average) Assets $ 937,217 $ 864,686 8 $ 923,756 $ 851,425 8 Trading assets-debt and equity instruments 358,611 351,678 2 356,750 340,073 5 Trading assets-derivative receivables 60,623 54,937 10 60,393 56,931 6 Loans: Loans retained(a) $ 113,950 $ 110,011 4 $ 111,665 $ 109,204 2 Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value 5,961 5,789 3 5,722 5,550 3 Total loans $ 119,911 $ 115,800 4 $ 117,387 $ 114,754 2 Core loans 119,637 115,434 4 117,090 114,375 2 Equity 70,000 70,000 — 70,000 70,000 — Headcount 51,400 49,228 4% 51,400 49,228 4% (a) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans, loans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for- investment loans and overdrafts.

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions. For a description of the composition of these income statement line items, refer to Notes 5 and 6. For further information, refer to Markets revenue on page 65 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

The decrease in taxable-equivalent adjustments reflects the impact of TCJA. (c) Effective in the first quarter of 2018, certain Operations and Compliance staff were transferred from CCB and Corporate, respectively, to CB. As a result, expense for this staff is now reflected in CB’s compensation expense with a corresponding adjustment for expense allocations reflected in noncompensation expense. CB’s, Corporate’s and CCB’s previously reported headcount, compensation expense and noncompensation expense have been revised to reflect this transfer. Quarterly results Net income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21%. Net revenue was $2.3 billion, an increase of 11%. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, an increase of 12%, driven by higher deposit margins. Noninterest revenue was $633 million, an increase of 9% driven by higher investment banking revenue from an increased number of large transactions. Noninterest expense was $844 million, an increase of 7%, predominantly driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology. The provision for credit losses was an expense of $43 million. The prior year was a benefit of $130 million driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses, including in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines and Metals & Mining portfolios. Year-to-date results Net income was $2.1 billion, an increase of 24%. Net revenue was $4.5 billion, an increase of 9%. Net interest income was $3.3 billion, an increase of 13%, driven by higher deposit margins. Noninterest revenue was $1.2 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology. The provision for credit losses was an expense of $38 million. The prior year was a benefit of $167 million, driven by net reductions in the allowance for credit losses, including in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines and Metals & Mining portfolios. 32 Selected income statement data (continued) Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions, except ratios) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Revenue by product Lending $ 1,026 $ 1,023 —% $ 2,025 $ 2,015 —% Treasury services 1,026 854 20 1,998 1,650 21 Investment banking(a) 254 189 34 438 405 8 Other 10 22 (55) 21 36 (42) Total Commercial Banking net revenue $ 2,316 $ 2,088 11 $ 4,482 $ 4,106 9 Investment banking revenue, gross(b) $ 739 $ 533 39 $ 1,308 $ 1,199 9 Revenue by client segment Middle Market Banking $ 919 $ 839 10 $ 1,814 $ 1,623 12 Corporate Client Banking 807 662 22 1,494 1,328 13 Commercial Term Lending 344 364 (5) 696 731 (5) Real Estate Banking 170 147 16 334 281 19 Other 76 76 — 144 143 1 Total Commercial Banking net revenue $ 2,316 $ 2,088 11% $ 4,482 $ 4,106 9% Financial ratios Return on equity 21% 17% 20% 16% Overhead ratio 36 38 38 39 (a) Includes total Firm revenue from investment banking products sold to CB clients, net of revenue sharing with the CIB.

Net revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 4%. Net interest income was $885 million, up 5%, driven by deposit margin expansion and loan growth. Noninterest revenue was $2.7 billion, up 4%, driven by higher management fees from net long-term product inflows and higher market levels, partially offset by fee compression and the impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments. Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 6%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and advisors, as well as higher external fees on revenue growth. Year-to-date results Net income was $1.5 billion, an increase of 51%. Net revenue was $7.1 billion, an increase of 5%. Net interest income was $1.8 billion, up 6%, driven by deposit margin expansion and loan growth. Noninterest revenue was $5.3 billion, up 5%, driven by higher management fees from net long-term product inflows and higher market levels, partially offset by fee compression and the impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments. Noninterest expense was $5.1 billion, a decrease of 1%, driven by higher legal expense in 1Q17, largely offset by investments in technology and advisors, as well as higher external fees on revenue growth. 36 Selected metrics As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except ranking data, headcount and ratios) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change % of JPM mutual fund assets rated as 4- or 5-star(a) 59 % 65% 59 % 65% % of JPM mutual fund assets ranked in 1st or 2nd quartile:(b) 1 year 65 60 65 60 3 years 71 83 71 83 5 years 85 77 85 77 Selected balance sheet data (period-end) Total assets $ 161,474 $ 147,508 9% $ 161,474 $ 147,508 9% Loans 138,606 124,517 11 138,606 124,517 11 Core loans 138,606 124,517 11 138,606 124,517 11 Deposits 131,511 146,758 (10) 131,511 146,758 (10) Equity 9,000 9,000 — 9,000 9,000 — Selected balance sheet data (average) Total assets $ 158,244 $ 142,966 11 $ 156,305 $ 140,585 11 Loans 136,710 122,173 12 134,683 120,252 12 Core loans 136,710 122,173 12 134,683 120,252 12 Deposits 139,557 150,786 (7) 141,865 154,776 (8) Equity 9,000 9,000 — 9,000 9,000 — Headcount 23,141 22,289 4 23,141 22,289 4 Number of Wealth Management client advisors 2,644 2,452 8 2,644 2,452 8 Credit data and quality statistics Net charge-offs $ (5) $ 2 NM $ (4) $ 5 NM Nonaccrual loans 323 400 (19) 323 400 (19) Allowance for credit losses: Allowance for loan losses $ 304 $ 285 7 $ 304 $ 285 7 Allowance for lending-related commitments 15 10 50 15 10 50 Total allowance for credit losses $ 319 $ 295 8% $ 319 $ 295 8% Net charge-off rate (0.01)% 0.01% (0.01)% 0.01% Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans 0.22 0.23 0.22 0.23 Allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans 94 71 94 71 Nonaccrual loans to period-end loans 0.23 0.32 0.23 0.32 (a) Represents the “overall star rating” derived from Morningstar for the U.S., the U.K., Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Taiwan domiciled funds; and Nomura “star rating” for Japan domiciled funds.

Net revenue was $80 million, compared with $804 million in the prior year. The current period includes investment securities losses related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. The prior year included a $645 million benefit from a legal settlement. Noninterest expense of $279 million increased from the prior year, primarily driven by a pretax loss of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity. Current period income tax reflects a benefit of $189 million resulting from a change in the estimate for the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings as well as other net tax adjustments, that were predominantly offset by changes to certain tax reserves. Year-to-date results Net loss was $519 million, compared with net income of $605 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $152 million, compared with a gain of $779 million in the prior-year. The current period includes investment securities losses related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. The prior year included a $645 million benefit from a legal settlement. Noninterest expense of $366 million, up $85 million from prior year, includes a pretax loss in the current period of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity. Current period income tax expense reflects changes to certain tax reserves, largely offset by changes in the estimate for the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings and other tax adjustments. 40 Treasury and CIO overview At June 30, 2018, the average credit rating of the Treasury and CIO investment securities comprising the portfolio in the table below was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s).

For additional information, refer to Notes 1 and 9. 41 ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes that effective risk management requires: • Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management by each of the lines of business and corporate functions; and • Firmwide structures for risk governance. The Firm strives for continual improvement through efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent Board oversight. The impact of risk and control issues are carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm’s approach to risk management involves understanding drivers of risks, risk types, and impacts of risks. Drivers of risk include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types: • Strategic risk is the risk associated with the Firm’s current and future business plans and objectives, including capital risk, liquidity risk, and the impact to the Firm’s reputation. • Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. • Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. • Operational risk is the risk associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events and includes compliance risk, conduct risk, legal risk, and estimations and model risk. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts, such as reputation damage, loss of clients, and regulatory and enforcement actions. 42 The Firm has established Firmwide risk management functions to manage different risk types. The scope of a particular risk management function may include multiple risk types. For example, the Firm’s Country Risk Management function oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk. The following provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q and in JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report information about the Firm’s management of its key risks can be found.

The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable it to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength. The Firm’s capital risk management objectives are achieved through the establishment of minimum capital targets and a strong capital governance framework. Capital risk management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. The Firm’s minimum capital targets are based on the most binding of three pillars: an internal assessment of the Firm’s capital needs; an estimate of required capital under the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements; and Basel III Fully Phased-In regulatory minimums. Where necessary, each pillar may include a management-established buffer. For a further discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management, refer to pages 82–91 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, Note 19 of this Form 10-Q, and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website (http:// investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm). The Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries are subject to Basel III capital rules which include minimum capital ratio requirements that are subject to phase-in periods (“transitional period”) through the end of 2018. While this required capital remains subject to the transitional rules during 2018, as of January 1, 2018, the Firm’s capital in the form of CET1 and Tier 1, and the Firm’s risk-weighted assets were equivalent whether calculated on a transitional basis or on a fully phased-in basis. The capital adequacy of the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, both during the transitional period and upon full phase-in, is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) which, for each quarter, results in the lower ratio as required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Collins Floor”). The Basel III Standardized Fully Phased-In CET1 ratio is the Firm’s current binding constraint, and the Firm expects that this will remain its binding constraint for the foreseeable future. The Firm is subject to minimum capital ratios under Basel III rules and well-capitalized ratios under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 19. 44 The following tables present the Firm’s Transitional and Fully Phased-In risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm’s Basel III ratios exceeded both the Transitional and Fully Phased-In regulatory minimums as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. For a further discussion of these capital metrics, including regulatory minimums, and the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, refer to Strategy and Governance on pages 84–88 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

(b) Effective January 1, 2018, the SLR was fully phased-in under Basel III. The December 31, 2017, amounts were calculated under the Basel III Transitional rules. Recent regulatory developments In April 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) proposed the introduction of a stress buffer framework that would create a single, integrated set of capital requirements by combining the supervisory stress test results of the CCAR assessment and those under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test) with current point-in-time capital requirements. If the proposal is finalized in its current form, the new minimum capital requirements will become effective on October 1, 2019. In addition, in April 2018, the FRB and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released a proposal to revise the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (“eSLR”) requirements applicable to the U.S. global systemically important bank (“GSIBs”) and their subsidiary insured depository institutions (“IDIs”) and to make conforming changes to the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”) and external long-term debt that satisfies certain eligibility criteria (“eligible LTD”) requirements applicable to U.S. GSIBs. The Firm continues to evaluate the impact of these proposals. 45 Capital components The following table presents reconciliations of total stockholders’ equity to Basel III Fully Phased-In CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Supplementary leverage ratio The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. For additional information, refer to Capital Risk Management on page 88 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s Fully Phased-In SLR as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. (in millions, except ratio) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Tier 1 capital $ 210,321 $ 208,564 Total average assets 2,612,969 2,562,155 Less: Adjustments for deductions from Tier 1 capital 46,956 47,333 Total adjusted average assets(a) 2,566,013 2,514,822 Off-balance sheet exposures(b) 689,283 690,193 Total leverage exposure $ 3,255,296 $ 3,205,015 SLR 6.5% 6.5% (a) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the SLR, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly goodwill and other intangible assets. (b) Off-balance sheet exposures are calculated as the average of the three month-end spot balances during the quarter. As of June 30, 2018, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s and Chase Bank USA, N.A.’s Fully Phased-In SLRs were approximately 6.7% and 13.1%, respectively. Line of business equity Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons and regulatory capital requirements. For additional information, refer to page 88 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following table represents the capital allocated to each business segment: (in billions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Consumer & Community Banking $ 51.0 $ 51.0 Corporate & Investment Bank 70.0 70.0 Commercial Banking 20.0 20.0 Asset & Wealth Management 9.0 9.0 Corporate 81.4 79.6 Total common stockholders’ equity $ 231.4 $ 229.6 Planning and stress testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. Through the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve evaluates each bank holding company’s (“BHC”) capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes, as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. On June 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object, on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, to the Firm’s 2018 capital plan. Capital actions Preferred stock Preferred stock dividends declared were $788 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Common stock dividends The current quarter common stock dividend was $0.56 per share. On June 28, 2018, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.80 per share, effective the third quarter of 2018. The Firm’s dividends are subject to the Board of Directors’ approval on a quarterly basis. 47 Common equity Effective as of June 28, 2018, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $20.7 billion of common equity (common stock and warrants) between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, as part of its annual capital plan. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. There were no repurchases of warrants during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

There were 12.1 million and 15.0 million warrants outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Other capital requirements TLAC The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the top-tier U.S. GSIB holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD effective January 1, 2019. As of June 30, 2018, the Firm was compliant with the requirements of the rule to which it will be subject on January 1, 2019. For additional information, refer to page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Broker-dealer regulatory capital J.P. Morgan Securities JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also registered as a futures commission merchant and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities has elected to compute its minimum net capital requirements under the “Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital Rule. Under the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule, J.P. Morgan Securities is eligible to use the alternative method of computing net capital if, in addition to meeting its minimum net capital requirement, it maintains tentative net capital of at least $1.0 billion. J.P. Morgan Securities is required to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in the event that tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. As of June 30, 2018, J.P. Morgan Securities maintained tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities’ net capital information: June 30, 2018 Net Capital (in millions) Actual Minimum J.P. Morgan Securities $ 16,649 $ 2,888 J.P. Morgan Securities plc J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and is the Firm’s principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. It has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulatory Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is subject to the European Union Capital Requirements Regulation and the U.K. PRA capital rules, each of which implemented Basel III and thereby subject J.P. Morgan Securities plc to its requirements. The following table presents J.P.

For a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 92–97 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report and the Firm’s US LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at: (https://investor.shareholder.com/ jpmorganchase/basel.cfm). LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires the Firm to maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A that are in excess of each entity’s standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017 based on the Firm’s current interpretation of the finalized LCR framework. Three months ended Average amount (in billions) June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018 June 30, 2017 HQLA Eligible cash(a) $ 363 $ 358 378 Eligible securities(b)(c) 166 181 163 Total HQLA(d) $ 529 $ 539 541 Net cash outflows $ 458 468 469 LCR 115% 115% 115% Net excess HQLA (d) $ 71 71 72 (a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rules. (c) HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows under the LCR as a result of ongoing business activity. The Firm’s HQLA are expected to be available to meet its liquidity needs in a time of stress. Other liquidity sources As of June 30, 2018, in addition to assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA under the LCR rule, the Firm had approximately $215 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. This includes HQLA- eligible securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non- bank affiliates. As of June 30, 2018, the Firm also had approximately $292 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”), discount windows at Federal Reserve Banks and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at Federal Reserve Bank discount windows. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount windows and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. Funding Sources of funds Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations. The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm’s loan portfolio is funded with a portion of the Firm’s deposits, through securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm’s real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the FHLBs. Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments are primarily funded by the Firm’s securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities-debt and equity instruments, and a portion of the Firm’s long-term debt and stockholders’ equity. In addition to funding securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and trading assets-debt and equity instruments, proceeds from the Firm’s debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Refer to the discussion below for additional information relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance. 49 Deposits The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposit balances as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and the average deposit balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, Deposits Average Average (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Consumer & Community Banking $ 679,154 $ 659,885 $ 673,761 $ 639,873 $ 666,719 $ 631,441 Corporate & Investment Bank 475,761 455,883 475,697 442,387 470,788 434,968 Commercial Banking 165,170 181,512 170,665 173,081 173,081 174,843 Asset & Wealth Management 131,511 146,407 139,557 150,786 141,865 154,776 Corporate 526 295 815 4,002 839 4,870 Total Firm $ 1,452,122 $ 1,443,982 $ 1,460,495 $ 1,410,129 $ 1,453,292 $ 1,400,898 A key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. (in billions except ratios) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Deposits $ 1,452.1 $ 1,444.0 Deposits as a % of total liabilities 62% 63% Loans $ 948.4 $ 930.7 Loans-to-deposits ratio 65% 64% Deposits increased from December 31, 2017, due to higher deposits in the consumer business reflecting the continuation of growth from new and existing customers and low attrition rates in CCB, partially offset by balance migration as customers shift from deposits largely into the Firm’s investment-related products; and in the wholesale business reflecting an increase in CIB’s Treasury Services business driven by growth in client activity. The increase was partially offset by declines in the other wholesale businesses primarily driven by the impact of seasonality in CB and AWM, and balance migration in AWM predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products. Average deposits increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, due to higher deposits in the consumer business and in CIB, partially offset by declines in AWM and Corporate. Drivers of the changes in average balances for these businesses are generally consistent with the drivers of the changes in the period-end balances described above. The decline in average Corporate deposits was predominantly due to maturities of wholesale non- operating deposits, which are consistent with the Firm’s efforts to reduce such products. The Firm believes average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. For further information on deposit and liability balance trends, refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 18–40 and pages 11–13, respectively. 50 The following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and average balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information, refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 11–13 and Note 10.

(d) Excludes federal funds purchased. (e) Subordinated debt includes $1.6 billion of junior subordinated debentures distributed pro rata to the holders of trust preferred securities which were cancelled on December 18, 2017. For further information refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. (f) Other securitizations include securitizations of student loans. The Firm deconsolidated the student loan securitization entities in the second quarter of 2017 as it no longer had a controlling financial interest in these entities as a result of the sale of the student loan portfolio. The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions, which are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table. (g) Includes long-term structured notes which are secured. (h) For additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 43–47, Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, and Note 20 and Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Short-term funding The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government- issued debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase at June 30, 2018, from December 31, 2017, reflected higher secured financing of trading assets-debt and equity instruments, partially offset by a change in the mix of funding to short- term borrowings in CIB. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities; the Firm’s demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market- making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors. The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The increase in commercial paper was due to higher net issuance. 51 Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”). The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. For additional information on the IHC and long-term debt, refer to Liquidity Risk Management and Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

The Firm deconsolidated the student loan securitization entities in the second quarter of 2017 as it no longer had a controlling financial interest in these entities as a result of the sale of the student loan portfolio. (b) Includes long-term structured notes which are secured. (c) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 52 Credit ratings The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, refer to SPEs on page 14, and Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 4. The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and nonbank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2018, were as follows. JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Chase Bank USA, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC J.P. Morgan Securities plc June 30, 2018 Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Moody’s Investors Service A3 P-2 Stable Aa3 P-1 Stable A1 P-1 Stable Standard & Poor’s A- A-2 Stable A+ A-1 Stable A+ A-1 Stable Fitch Ratings AA- F1+ Stable AA F1+ Stable AA F1+ Stable On June 21, 2018, Fitch upgraded the Parent Company’s long term issuer rating to AA- (previously A+) and short term issuer rating to F1+ (previously F1). The long term issuer ratings were also upgraded to AA for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, Chase Bank USA, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (all previously AA-). Downgrades of the Firm’s long-term ratings by one or two notches could result in an increase in its cost of funds, and access to certain funding markets could be reduced. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price. Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings. 53 CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments.

These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”). (f) For the six months ended June 30, 2017, excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio transfer, the net charge-off rate for Loans would have been 0.54% and for Loans – excluding PCI would have been 0.56%. 55 CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market.

These operating lease assets are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. The risk of loss on these assets relates to the residual value of the leased vehicles, which is managed through projection of the lease residual value at lease origination, periodic review of residual values, and through arrangements with certain auto manufacturers that mitigates this risk. (b) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included within the consumer portfolio. (c) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans. (d) For the six months ended June 30, 2017, excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio sale, the net charge-off rate for Total consumer, excluding credit card and PCI loans and loans held-for-sale would have been 0.20%; Total consumer – retained excluding credit card loans would have been 0.18%; Total consumer credit portfolio would have been 0.95%; and Total consumer credit portfolio, excluding PCI loans would have been 1.02%. (e) At both June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, approximately 68% of the PCI option adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) portfolio has been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. 56 (f) Credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home equity commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For further information, refer to Note 20. (g) Receivables from customers represent held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (h) Includes billed interest and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible interest and fees. (i) At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC. (j) Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools is performing. (k) Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rates excluded write-offs in the PCI portfolio of $73 million and $22 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $93 million and $46 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 67–69 for further information. (l) Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $291 million and $4.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $263 million and $2.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off rates. Consumer, excluding credit card Portfolio analysis Consumer loan balances increased from December 31, 2017 predominantly due to originations of high-quality prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet, largely offset by paydowns and the charge- off or liquidation of delinquent loans. PCI loans are excluded from the following discussions of individual loan products and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm’s consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q. Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio predominantly consists of high-quality prime mortgage loans, with a small component consisting of subprime mortgage loans (approximately 1%). These subprime mortgage loans continue to run off and are performing in line with expectations. The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, increased from December 31, 2017 as the amount of retained originations of primarily high-quality prime mortgage loans exceeded paydowns. Residential mortgage 30+ day delinquencies decreased from December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017 due to lower delinquencies. Net recoveries for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were higher compared with the same period in the prior year reflecting a loan sale as well as continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included $20.8 billion and $20.2 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. To date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader residential mortgage portfolio. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans. The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government- insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Current $ 3,194 $ 2,401 30-89 days past due 1,741 1,958 90 or more days past due 3,254 4,264 Total government guaranteed loans $ 8,189 $ 8,623 Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from December 31, 2017 primarily reflecting loan paydowns. The amount of 30+ day delinquencies decreased from December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of loss mitigation activities. Net recoveries for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2018 improved when compared with the same period in the prior year, as a result of lower loan balances and continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. At June 30, 2018, approximately 90% of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $27 billion at June 30, 2018. This amount included $13 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. 57 The Firm monitors risks associated with junior lien loans where the borrower has a senior lien loan that is either delinquent or has been modified. These loans are considered “high-risk seconds” and are classified as nonaccrual as they are considered to pose a higher risk of default than other junior lien loans. The carrying value of high-risk seconds declined from December 31, 2017. For further information on the Firm’s home equity portfolio, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 102-107 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Auto: The auto loan portfolio, which predominantly consists of prime-quality loans, declined when compared with December 31, 2017, as paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans were partially offset by new originations. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were relatively flat when compared with the same period in the prior year. Consumer & Business Banking: Consumer & Business Banking loans increased when compared with December 31, 2017, as growth due to loan originations was predominantly offset by paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year. Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans decreased from December 31, 2017 due to portfolio run off and a loan sale. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 11% of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 68% of the portfolio had been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment. The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses. Summary of PCI loans lifetime principal loss estimates Lifetime loss estimates(a) Life-to-date liquidation losses(b) (in billions) Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Home equity $ 14.1 $ 14.2 $ 13.0 $ 12.9 Prime mortgage 4.1 4.0 3.8 3.8 Subprime mortgage 3.3 3.3 3.1 3.1 Option ARMs 10.3 10.0 9.9 9.7 Total $ 31.8 $ 31.5 $ 29.8 $ 29.5 (a) Includes the original nonaccretable difference established in purchase accounting of $30.5 billion for principal losses plus additional principal losses recognized subsequent to acquisition through the provision and allowance for loan losses. The remaining nonaccretable difference for principal losses was $624 million and $842 million at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. (b) Represents both realization of loss upon loan resolution and any principal forgiven upon modification. Geographic composition of residential real estate loans For information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s residential real estate loans, refer to Note 11. Current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have declined consistent with recent improvements in home prices, customer pay downs, and charge-offs or liquidations of higher LTV loans. For further information on current estimated LTVs on residential real estate loans, refer to Note 11. Loan modification activities for residential real estate loans The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type due to differences in both the credit quality and the types of modifications provided. The performance of modifications to the residential real estate portfolios as measured through cumulative redefault rates, were not materially different from December 31, 2017. For further information on the Firm’s cumulative redefault rates refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 102-107 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Certain loans that were modified under HAMP and the Firm’s proprietary modification programs have interest rate reset provisions (“step-rate modifications”). Interest rates on these loans generally began to increase commencing in 2014 by 1% per year, and will continue to do so, until the rate reaches a specified cap. The cap on these loans is typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate mortgage loan as of the modification date. At June 30, 2018, the carrying value of non-PCI loans and the unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications, which have not yet met their specified caps, were $2 billion and $5 billion, respectively. The Firm continues to monitor this risk exposure and the impact of these potential interest rate increases is considered in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. 58 The following table presents information as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For further information on modifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, refer to Note 11. Modified residential real estate loans June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (in millions) Retained loans Non- accrual retained loans(d) Retained loans Non- accrual retained loans(d) Modified residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans(a)(b) Residential mortgage $ 5,024 $ 1,730 $ 5,620 $ 1,743 Home equity 2,092 1,041 2,118 1,032 Total modified residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans $ 7,116 $ 2,771 $ 7,738 $ 2,775 Modified PCI loans(c) Home equity $ 2,180 NA $ 2,277 NA Prime mortgage 3,684 NA 4,490 NA Subprime mortgage 2,322 NA 2,678 NA Option ARMs 7,196 NA 8,276 NA Total modified PCI loans $ 15,382 NA $ 17,721 NA (a) Amounts represent the carrying value of modified residential real estate loans. (b) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. For additional information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae, refer to Note 13. (c) Amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans. (d) At both June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans included $2.2 billion of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, refer to Note 11. Nonperforming assets The following table presents information as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets(a) (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Nonaccrual loans(b) Residential real estate $ 3,582 $ 3,785 Other consumer 397 424 Total nonaccrual loans 3,979 4,209 Assets acquired in loan satisfactions Real estate owned 206 225 Other 33 40 Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions 239 265 Total nonperforming assets $ 4,218 $ 4,474 (a) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, and REO insured by U.S. government agencies of $84 million and $95 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (b) Excludes PCI loans, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of the pools, or that of individual loans within the pools, is not meaningful. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of loans as each of the pools is performing. Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio at June 30, 2018 decreased to $3.6 billion from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2017, of which 26% were greater than 150 days past due for both time periods. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 34% and 40% to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Nonaccrual loan activity Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 Beginning balance $ 4,209 $ 4,820 Additions 1,575 1,647 Reductions: Principal payments and other(a) 738 888 Charge-offs 246 372 Returned to performing status 666 750 Foreclosures and other liquidations 155 231 Total reductions 1,805 2,241 Net changes (230) (594) Ending balance $ 3,979 $ 4,226 (a) Other reductions includes loan sales. Active and suspended foreclosure: For information on loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure, refer to Note 11. 59 Credit card Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2017 due to seasonality. The June 30, 2018 30+ day delinquency rate seasonally decreased to 1.65% from 1.80% at December 31, 2017, and the June 30, 2018 90+ day delinquency rate decreased to 0.85% from 0.92% at December 31, 2017, in line with expectations. Net charge- offs increased for the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to growth in newer vintages which, as anticipated, have higher loss rates than the more seasoned portion of the portfolio. For further information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans, refer to Note 11. Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Modifications of credit card loans At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Firm had $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, refer to Note 11. 60 WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market- making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The credit quality of the wholesale portfolio was stable for the six months ended June 30, 2018, characterized by low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge- offs. Refer to industry discussion on pages 62–64 for further information. Retained loans increased across all wholesale lines of business, predominantly driven by CIB, including loans to financial institution and commercial and industrial clients, and in AWM due to higher loans to international and domestic Private Banking clients. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, and excludes all exposure managed by CCB.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold through credit derivatives used to manage both performing and nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. For additional information, refer to Credit derivatives on page 66, and Note 4. (c) Excludes assets acquired in loan satisfactions. 61 The following tables present the maturity and ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings assigned by S&P and Moody’s. For additional information on wholesale loan portfolio risk ratings, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. (c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. (d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is based on the remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2018, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 62 Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $11.2 billion at June 30, 2018, compared with $15.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was largely driven by select names within Oil & Gas, including a loan sale. Below are summaries of the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

Loans In the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For a further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators and sales of loans, refer to Note 11. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Wholesale nonaccrual loan activity Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 Beginning balance $ 1,734 $ 2,063 Additions 505 747 Reductions: Paydowns and other 394 666 Gross charge-offs 231 93 Returned to performing status 176 183 Sales 107 203 Total reductions 908 1,145 Net changes (403) (398) Ending balance $ 1,331 $ 1,665 The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans. Wholesale net charge-offs/ (recoveries) (in millions, except ratios) Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Loans – reported Average loans retained $ 414,980 $ 392,257 $ 409,949 $ 387,339 Gross charge- offs 176 73 241 99 Gross recoveries (30) (16) (76) (69) Net charge- offs/ (recoveries) 146 57 165 30 Net charge- off/ (recovery) rate 0.14% 0.06% 0.08% 0.02% 65 Lending-related commitments The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring. In the Firm’s view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further information on wholesale lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20 . Derivative contracts Derivatives enable clients to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. In the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. For a further discussion of derivative contracts, refer to Note 4. The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented. Derivative receivables (in millions) Derivative receivables June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Interest rate $ 22,971 $ 24,673 Credit derivatives 624 869 Foreign exchange 16,763 16,151 Equity 10,176 7,882 Commodity 7,976 6,948 Total, net of cash collateral 58,510 56,523 Liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables(a) (16,103) (16,108) Total, net of collateral $ 42,407 $ 40,415 (a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $58.5 billion and $56.5 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $16.1 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative transactions move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements, refer to Note 4. 66 The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as assigned by S&P and Moody’s. Ratings profile of derivative receivables June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Rating equivalent (in millions, except ratios) Exposure net of collateral % of exposure net of collateral Exposure net of collateral % of exposure net of collateral AAA/Aaa to AA-/Aa3 $ 11,133 26% $ 11,529 29% A+/A1 to A-/A3 7,796 18 6,919 17 BBB+/Baa1 to BBB-/Baa3 14,851 35 13,925 34 BB+/Ba1 to B-/B3 7,997 19 7,397 18 CCC+/Caa1 and below 630 2 645 2 Total $ 42,407 100% $ 40,415 100% As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 90% at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Credit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit portfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities Notional amount of protection purchased and sold(a) (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Credit derivatives used to manage: Loans and lending-related commitments $ 1,297 $ 1,867 Derivative receivables 13,932 15,742 Credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities $ 15,229 $ 17,609 (a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index. For further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, refer to Credit derivatives in Note 4 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 67 ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. For further information on the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 77–79 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q, and Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 138–140 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of June 30, 2018, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The wholesale allowance for credit losses decreased from December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a reduction in the allowance for the Oil & Gas portfolio driven by a single name. The consumer allowance for credit losses was relatively flat compared with December 31, 2017. For additional information on the wholesale and consumer credit portfolios, refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 60–66, and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 55– 59 and Note 11. 68 Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses 2018 2017 Six months ended June 30, Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(in millions, except ratios) Allowance for loan losses Beginning balance at January 1, $ 4,579 $ 4,884 $ 4,141 $ 13,604 $ 5,198 $ 4,034 $ 4,544 $ 13,776 Gross charge-offs 539 2,578 241 3,358 1,105 2,223 99 3,427 Gross recoveries (451) (244) (76) (771) (307) (193) (69) (569) Net charge-offs(a) 88 2,334 165 2,587 798 2,030 30 2,858 Write-offs of PCI loans(b) 93 — — 93 46 — — 46 Provision for loan losses 90 2,334 (98) 2,326 448 2,380 (337) 2,491 Other — — — — (2) — 2 — Ending balance at June 30, $ 4,488 $ 4,884 $ 3,878 $ 13,250 $ 4,800 $ 4,384 $ 4,179 $ 13,363 Impairment methodology Asset-specific(c) $ 226 $ 402 $ 318 $ 946 $ 296 $ 370 $ 345 $ 1,011 Formula-based 2,130 4,482 3,560 10,172 2,239 4,014 3,834 10,087 PCI 2,132 — — 2,132 2,265 — — 2,265 Total allowance for loan losses $ 4,488 $ 4,884 $ 3,878 $ 13,250 $ 4,800 $ 4,384 $ 4,179 $ 13,363 Allowance for lending-related commitments Beginning balance at January 1, $ 33 $ — $ 1,035 $ 1,068 $ 26 $ — $ 1,052 $ 1,078 Provision for lending-related commitments — — 49 49 6 — 33 39 Other — — — — — — — — Ending balance at June 30, $ 33 $ — $ 1,084 $ 1,117 $ 32 $ — $ 1,085 $ 1,117 Impairment methodology Asset-specific $ — $ — $ 139 $ 139 $ — $ — $ 211 $ 211 Formula-based 33 — 945 978 32 — 874 906 Total allowance for lending-related commitments(d) $ 33 $ — $ 1,084 $ 1,117 $ 32 $ — $ 1,085 $ 1,117 Total allowance for credit losses $ 4,521 $ 4,884 $ 4,962 $ 14,367 $ 4,832 $ 4,384 $ 5,264 $ 14,480 Memo: Retained loans, end of period $ 374,587 $ 145,221 $ 420,632 $ 940,440 $ 365,115 $ 140,035 $ 394,426 $ 899,576 Retained loans, average 373,562 142,757 409,949 926,268 364,316 137,574 387,339 889,229 PCI loans, end of period 26,977 — 3 26,980 33,064 — 3 33,067 Credit ratios Allowance for loan losses to retained loans 1.20% 3.36% 0.92% 1.41% 1.31% 3.13% 1.06% 1.49% Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(e) 113 NM 335 258 114 NM 256 229 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card 113 NM 335 163 114 NM 256 154 Net charge-off rates(a) 0.05 3.30 0.08 0.56 0.44 2.98 0.02 0.65 Credit ratios, excluding residential real estate PCI loans Allowance for loan losses to retained loans 0.68 3.36 0.92 1.22 0.76 3.13 1.06 1.28 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(e) 59 NM 335 217 60 NM 256 190 Allowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card 59 NM 335 121 60 NM 256 115 Net charge-off rates(a) 0.05% 3.30% 0.08% 0.58% 0.49% 2.98% 0.02% 0.67% Note: In the table above, the financial measures which exclude the impact of PCI loans are non-GAAP financial measures. (a) For the six months ended June 30, 2017, excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio transfer, the net charge-off rate for Consumer, excluding credit card would have been 0.18%; total Firm would have been 0.54%; Consumer, excluding credit card and PCI loans would have been 0.20%; and total Firm, excluding PCI would have been 0.56%. (b) Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool. (c) Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates. (d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. (e) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. 69 Provision for credit losses The following table presents the components of the Firm’s provision for credit losses: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, Provision for loan losses Provision for lending- related commitments Total provision for credit losses Provision for loan losses Provision for lending- related commitments Total provision for credit losses (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Consumer, excluding credit card $ (56) $ 6 $ — $ 6 $ (56) $ 12 $ 90 $ 448 $ — $ 6 $ 90 $ 454 Credit card 1,164 1,387 — — 1,164 1,387 2,334 2,380 — — 2,334 2,380 Total consumer 1,108 1,393 — 6 1,108 1,399 2,424 2,828 — 6 2,424 2,834 Wholesale 91 (218) 11 34 102 (184) (98) (337) 49 33 (49) (304) Total $ 1,199 $ 1,175 $ 11 $ 40 $ 1,210 $ 1,215 $ 2,326 $ 2,491 $ 49 $ 39 $ 2,375 $ 2,530 Quarterly discussion The provision for credit losses was flat as a result of: • a decrease in the consumer provision predominantly reflecting – no addition to the allowance for credit losses in CCB in the current quarter, compared with a net addition in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio – lower net charge-offs, primarily in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery from a loan sale, and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, predominantly offset by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations the decrease in the consumer provision was offset by • an increase in the wholesale provision reflecting – a net expense in the current period as a result of net portfolio activity, including new exposures and loan sales, compared with a net benefit in the prior year driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals and Mining portfolios. Year-to-date discussion The provision for credit losses decreased as a result of: • a lower consumer provision predominantly reflecting – no addition to the allowance for credit losses in CCB in the current year, compared with a net addition in the prior year primarily in the credit card portfolio partially offset by – higher net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio due to seasoning of newer vintages, in line with expectations. These were largely offset by lower net charge-offs in the residential real estate portfolio, which includes a recovery from a loan sale and reflects the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies – the prior year included a $218 million write-down recorded in connection with the sale of the student loan portfolio the decrease in the consumer provision was partially offset by • a lower net benefit in the wholesale provision reflecting – a net benefit in the current period, primarily driven by a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio, partially offset by other net portfolio activity, compared with a net benefit in the prior year, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in the Oil & Gas, Natural Gas Pipelines, and Metals and Mining portfolios. 70 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives or from principal investments managed in various LOBs in predominantly privately-held financial assets and instruments. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. Investment securities risk Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is minimized given that Treasury and CIO generally invest in high-quality securities. At June 30, 2018, the investment securities portfolio was $231.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s).

Principal investment risk Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments cover multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. Increasingly, new principal investments are made to enhance or accelerate LOB strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the various LOBs and are reflected within the respective LOB financial results. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets, which requires fair value adjustments upon observable price changes to certain equity investments previously held at cost in the principal investment portfolios. For additional information, refer to Note 2. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were $19.9 billion and $19.5 billion, respectively, which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments) of $13.6 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. For a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk Management governance and oversight, refer to page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 71 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. For a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management organization, tools used to measure risk, risk monitoring and control and risk identification and classification, refer to Market Risk Management on pages 121-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Value-at-risk JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other measures such as stress testing and nonstatistical measures, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions. For further information, refer to Other risk measures on pages 126-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. For information regarding model reviews and approvals, refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a stable measure of VaR that closely aligns to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business, and provides the necessary and appropriate information to respond to risk events on a daily basis. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. For further information regarding the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR, refer to page 123 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR- based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting), refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at: (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm). 72 The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. Total VaR Three months ended June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018 June 30, 2017 (in millions) Avg. Min Max Avg. Min Max Avg.

The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated. (b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across lines of business and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful. Quarter over Quarter results Average total VaR decreased by $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared with the prior quarter. The decrease reflects changes in the exposure profile for Equities and Fixed income risk types. Year over Year results Average total VaR increased by $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in the prior year. The increase in average total VaR is primarily due to the inclusion of a Corporate private equity position that became publicly traded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and certain investments in CIB VaR. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change. 73 VaR back-testing The Firm evaluates the effectiveness of its VaR methodology by back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk related revenue. The Firm’s definition of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR excluding fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments (e.g., liquidity and FVA), net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading. The following chart compares actual daily market risk-related gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2018. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of back-testing disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to covered positions. The chart shows that for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Firm observed five VaR back-testing exceptions and posted market risk-related gains on 75 of the 129 days. The Firm observed one VaR back-testing exception and posted market risk-related gains on 35 of the 65 days for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Daily Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses vs. Risk Management VaR (1-day, 95% Confidence level) Six months ended June 30, 2018 Market Risk-Related Gains and Losses Risk Management VaR January February March April May June 74 Earnings-at-risk The VaR and sensitivity measures illustrate the economic sensitivity of the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. The Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk exposure through earnings-at-risk, which measures the extent to which changes in interest rates will affect the Firm’s net interest income and interest rate-sensitive fees. For a summary by line of business, identifying positions included in earnings- at-risk, refer to the table on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm generates a baseline for net interest income and certain interest rate-sensitive fees, and then conducts simulations of changes for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). This simulation primarily includes retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and excludes other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios consider the impact on exposures as a result of changes in interest rates from baseline rates, as well as pricing sensitivities of deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on scenario interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. The pricing sensitivity of deposits in the baseline and scenarios use assumed rates paid which may differ from actual rates paid due to timing lags and other factors. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. JPMorgan Chase’s 12-month earnings-at-risk sensitivity profiles U.S. dollar Instantaneous change in rates (in billions) +200 bps +100 bps -100 bps -200 bps June 30, 2018 $ 1.9 $ 1.0 $ (2.1) NM (a) December 31, 2017 $ 2.4 $ 1.7 $ (3.6) NM (a) (a) Given the level of market interest rates, these downward parallel earnings-at-risk scenarios are not considered to be meaningful. The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is largely a result of assets re- pricing at a faster pace than deposits. The Firm’s net U.S. dollar sensitivities to 200 and 100 basis points instantaneous rate increases each decreased by approximately $500 million and $700 million, respectively, while the Firm’s net U.S. dollar sensitivity to 100 basis points instantaneous decrease in rates decreased by $1.5 billion when compared to December 31, 2017. The primary driver of these decreases was the updating of the Firm’s baseline to reflect higher interest rates. As higher interest rates are reflected in the Firm’s baselines, sensitivities to changes in rates are expected to be less significant. The non-U.S. dollar sensitivities for an instantaneous increase in rates by 200 and 100 basis points results in a 12-month benefit to net interest income of approximately $900 million and $500 million, respectively, at June 30, 2018 and $800 million and $500 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The non-U.S. dollar sensitivities for an instantaneous decrease in rates by 200 and 100 basis points are not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Separately, another U.S. dollar interest rate scenario used by the Firm — involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels — results in a 12-month benefit to net interest income of approximately $500 million and $700 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in net interest income under this scenario reflects the Firm reinvesting at the higher long- term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged. The results of the comparable non-U.S. dollar scenarios are not material to the Firm at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 75 Other sensitivity-based measures The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and OCI due to changes in relevant market variables. For additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures, please refer to the Risk identification and classification table on page 122 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration in these sensitivities.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios giving rise to country risk to ensure the Firm’s country risk exposures are diversified and that exposure levels are appropriate given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or groups of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the firm, as necessary. For a further discussion of the Firm’s Country Risk Management organization; identification and measurement; stress testing; monitoring and control; and reporting, refer to pages 129–130 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2018. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending- related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. For further information on these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, refer to pages 117– 119, page 138 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 67–69 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q. As noted in the discussion on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, the Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Refer to Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion. To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of June 30, 2018, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses: • A combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply: an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $525 million for PCI loans. an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $75 million for residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans. • For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in unemployment rates from current levels could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately $775 million. • An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $1.5 billion. • A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately $175 million. The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. 78 Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventory Assets measured at fair value The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, refer to Note 2. June 30, 2018 (in millions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets Trading–debt and equity instruments $ 360.2 $ 4.5 Derivative receivables(a) 58.5 7.0 Trading assets 418.7 11.5 AFS securities 202.0 0.1 Loans 3.1 0.2 MSRs 6.2 6.2 Other 30.1 1.3 Total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 660.1 $ 19.3 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 1.6 1.0 Total assets measured at fair value $ 661.7 $ 20.3 Total Firm assets $ 2,590.1 Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets(a) 0.8% Level 3 assets as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a) 3.1% (a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $7.0 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. Valuation Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. For a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, refer to Note 2. For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm refer to Note 2. Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2. Goodwill impairment Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, refer to Goodwill impairment on pages 139–140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, business performance, the current estimated market cost of equity, and prior projections of business performance for all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of June 30, 2018. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. For additional information on goodwill, refer to Note 14. 79 Credit card rewards liability JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The rewards liability is sensitive to various assumptions, including cost per point and redemption rates for each of the various rewards programs, which are evaluated periodically. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $5.5 billion and $4.9 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Income taxes For a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 1, and Income taxes on page 140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Litigation reserves For a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 80 ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2018 Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Revenue recognition – revenue from contracts with customers Issued May 2014 • Requires that revenue from contracts with customers be recognized upon transfer of control of a good or service in the amount of consideration expected to be received. • Changes the accounting for certain contract costs, including whether they may be offset against revenue in the Consolidated statements of income, and requires additional disclosures about revenue and contract costs. • Adopted January 1, 2018. • For further information, refer to Note 1.

Treatment of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows Issued November 2016 • Requires restricted cash to be combined with unrestricted cash when reconciling the beginning and ending cash balances on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. • Requires additional disclosures to supplement the Consolidated statements of cash flows. • Adopted January 1, 2018 • For further information, refer to Note 1. 81 FASB Standards Adopted since January 1, 2018 (continued) Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Definition of a business Issued January 2017 • Narrows the definition of a business and clarifies that, to be considered a business, substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) may not be concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets. • In addition, the definition now requires that a set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. • Adopted January 1, 2018. • The adoption of the guidance had no impact because it is being applied prospectively. Subsequent to adoption, fewer transactions will be treated as acquisitions or dispositions of a business. Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost Issued March 2017 • Requires the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost to be reported separately in the Consolidated statements of income from the other components (e.g., expected return on assets, interest costs, amortization of gains/losses and prior service costs). • Adopted January 1, 2018. • For further information, refer to Note 1. Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities Issued March 2017 • Requires amortization of premiums to the earliest call date on debt securities with call features that are explicit, noncontingent and callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. • Does not impact debt securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to the contractual maturity date. • Adopted January 1, 2018. • For further information, refer to Note 1. Hedge accounting Issued August 2017 • Aligns the accounting with the economics of the risk management activities. • Expands the ability for certain hedges of interest rate risk to qualify for hedge accounting. • Allows recognition of ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges and net investment hedges in OCI. • Permits an election at adoption to transfer certain investment securities classified as held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. • Simplifies hedge documentation requirements. • Adopted January 1, 2018. • For further information, refer to Note 1. Reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI Issued February 2018 • Permits reclassification of the income tax effects of the TCJA on items within AOCI to retained earnings so that the tax effects of items within AOCI reflect the appropriate tax rate. • Adopted January 1, 2018. • For further information, refer to Note 1. 82 FASB Standards Issued but not yet Adopted Standard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements Leases Issued February 2016 • Requires lessees to recognize all leases longer than twelve months on the Consolidated balance sheets as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of- use asset. • Requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” classification tests. • Permits the Firm to generally account for its existing leases consistent with current guidance, except for the incremental balance sheet recognition. • Expands qualitative and quantitative leasing disclosures. • May be adopted using a modified cumulative effect approach wherein the guidance is applied only to existing contracts as of the date of initial application, and to new contracts transacted after that date, or a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the effective date. • Required effective date: January 1, 2019.(a) • The Firm is in the process of its implementation which includes evaluating its leasing activities and certain contracts for embedded leases, implementing a new lease accounting software solution for its real estate leases, and updating processes and internal controls for its leasing activities. As a lessee, the Firm is developing its estimate of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, which is based on the present value of lease payments. The Firm expects to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset (at their present value) related to predominantly all of the $10 billion of future minimum payments required under operating leases as disclosed in Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. However, the population of contracts subject to balance sheet recognition and their initial measurement remains under evaluation; final financial statement impacts will depend on the lease portfolio at the time of adoption. The Firm does not expect material changes to the recognition of operating lease expense in its Consolidated statements of income. • The Firm plans to adopt the new lease guidance on January 1, 2019 and elect the available practical expedients, which will not require it to reassess whether an existing contract contains a lease or whether classification or unamortized initial lease costs would be different under the new lease guidance. Financial instruments – credit losses Issued June 2016 • Replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost, which will reflect management’s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the financial assets. • Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and requires recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. • Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance, which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves. • Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • The Firm has established a Firmwide, cross-discipline governance structure, which provides implementation oversight. The Firm continues to identify key interpretive issues, and is in the process of developing and implementing current expected credit loss models that satisfy the requirements of the new standard. • The Firm expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in its allowance for credit losses due to several factors, including: 1. The allowance related to the Firm’s loans and commitments will increase to cover credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the portfolio, and will consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions 2. The nonaccretable difference on PCI loans will be recognized as an allowance, which will be offset by an increase in the carrying value of the related loans 3. An allowance will be established for estimated credit losses on non-agency HTM securities • The extent of the increase in the allowance is under evaluation, but will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the Firm’s portfolio at the adoption date, and the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date. • The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020. Goodwill Issued January 2017 • Requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value. • Eliminates the second condition in the current guidance that requires an impairment loss to be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value. • Required effective date: January 1, 2020.(a) • Based on current impairment test results, the Firm does not expect a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the impact of the new accounting guidance will depend on the performance of the reporting units and the market conditions at the time of adoption. • After adoption, the guidance may result in more frequent goodwill impairment losses due to the removal of the second condition. • The Firm plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2020. (a) Early adoption is permitted. 83 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements.

The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) are an integral part of these statements. 89 Refer to the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms on pages 172–176 for definitions of terms and acronyms used throughout the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments, refer to Note 23. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly presented. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. For a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation, refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. For further information on offsetting assets and liabilities, refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Application of U.S. GAAP related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and the Firm recorded the estimated impact of the deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings and the remeasurement of deferred taxes under the TCJA. These provisional amounts represent estimates under SEC guidance, which provides a one-year measurement period in which to refine the estimates based on new information or the issuance of interpretative guidance. Based on legislative clarifications published during the second quarter of 2018, which were specific to the deemed repatriation tax on non- U.S. earnings, the Firm recorded a tax benefit of $189 million. The Firm has made and continues to anticipate refinements to both calculations as a result of the issuance of additional legislative and accounting guidance as well as those in the normal course of business, including true-ups to the tax liability on the tax return as filed and the resolution of tax audits. The Firm considers any legislative or accounting guidance issued as of the balance sheet date when evaluating potential refinements to these estimates. 90 Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2018 The following table identifies the standards adopted, and the note where further information on the impact of the new guidance can be found: Revenue recognition – revenue from contracts with customers Note 5 Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities Notes 2 and 9 Treatment of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows Note 18 Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost Note 7 Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities Notes 9 and 17 Hedge accounting Notes 4, 9 and 17 Reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI Note 17 Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and prior period amounts were revised accordingly. The most significant of the new standards was revenue recognition, which requires gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. This change resulted in noninterest revenue and noninterest expense each increasing by $261 million and $525 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, with no impact to net income. Upon adoption of the restricted cash guidance, to align the Consolidated balance sheets with the Consolidated statements of cash flows, the Firm reclassified restricted cash into cash and due from banks or deposits with banks. In addition, for the Firm’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks. This guidance was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised, resulting in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks increasing by $71 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, and other assets decreasing by $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. 91 Note 2 – Fair value measurement For a discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 92 The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

(493,029) $ 211,644 (a) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations of $65.6 billion and $78.0 billion, respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related. (b) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included within trading loans were $14.8 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $5.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $9.7 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of zero and $836 million respectively. (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying 94 value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, refer to Note 4. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. (f) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $764 million and $779 million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, were trading assets of $50 million and $54 million, respectively, and other assets of $714 million and $725 million, respectively. (g) Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted the recognition and measurement guidance. Equity securities that were previously reported as AFS securities were reclassified to other assets upon adoption. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 there were no individually significant transfers. All transfers are based on changes in the observability of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Level 3 valuations For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/ or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/ instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at June 30, 2018, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range; equity correlation, equity-FX, and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate, yield and prepayment speed inputs used in estimating fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads and conditional default rates were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; loss severity and price inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range. 95 Level 3 inputs(a) June 30, 2018 Product/Instrument Fair value (in millions) Principal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g) Range of input values Weighted average Residential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b) $ 798 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% – 23% 6% Prepayment speed 0% – 50% 8% Conditional default rate 0% – 20% 1% Loss severity 0% – 100% 6% Commercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c) 445 Market comparables Price $ 6 – $ 101 $ 91 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 736 Market comparables Price $ 59 – $ 100 $ 97 Corporate debt securities 274 Market comparables Price $ 2 – $ 107 $ 82 Loans(d) 1,486 Market comparables Price $ 4 – $ 104 $ 87 Asset-backed securities 147 Discounted cash flows Credit spread 216 bps 216 bps Prepayment speed 20% 20% Conditional default rate 2% 2% Loss severity 30% 30% 87 Market comparables Price $ 4 – $ 100 $ 59 Net interest rate derivatives 293 Option pricing Interest rate spread volatility 16 bps – 38 bps Interest rate correlation (50)% – 97% IR-FX correlation 55% – 60% 196 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 0% – 30% Net credit derivatives (27) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 35% – 65% Credit spread 8 bps – 1,497 bps Recovery rate 20% – 70% Yield 1% – 36% Prepayment speed 0% – 18% Conditional default rate 0% – 93% Loss severity 0% – 100% 3 Market comparables Price $ 10 – $ 98 Net foreign exchange derivatives (62) Option pricing IR-FX correlation (50)% – 60% (183) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 8% – 9% Net equity derivatives (2,578) Option pricing Equity volatility 10% – 60% Equity correlation 10% – 95% Equity-FX correlation (70)% – 60% Equity-IR correlation 20% – 40% Net commodity derivatives (752) Option pricing Forward commodity price $ 52 – $ 80 per barrel Commodity volatility 5% – 53% Commodity correlation (52)% – 95% MSRs 6,241 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 14 Other assets 289 Discounted cash flows Credit spread 70 bps 70 bps Yield 8% – 10% 8% 1,342 Market comparables Price $ 35 – $ 104 $ 46 EBITDA multiple 3.0x – 8.4x 8.0x Long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e) 24,776 Option pricing Interest rate spread volatility 16 bps – 38 bps Interest rate correlation (50)% – 97% IR-FX correlation (50)% – 60% Equity correlation 10% – 95% Equity-FX correlation (70)% – 60% Equity-IR correlation 20% – 40% Other level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f) 419 (a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. (b) Includes U.S. government agency securities of $471 million, nonagency securities of $88 million and trading loans of $239 million. (c) Includes U.S. government agency securities of $7 million, nonagency securities of $18 million, trading loans of $261 million and non-trading loans of $159 million. (d) Comprises trading loans. (e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. (f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. 96 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs For a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments. 97 Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Three months ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) Fair value at April 1, 2018 Total realized/ unrealized gains/

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 0.8% of total Firm assets at June 30, 2018. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2017, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 102. Three months ended June 30, 2018 Level 3 assets were $19.3 billion at June 30, 2018, reflecting a decrease of $180 million from March 31, 2018 with no movements that were individually significant. Six months ended June 30, 2018 Level 3 assets at June 30, 2018 increased by $87 million from December 31, 2017 with no movements that were individually significant. Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. For further information on these instruments, refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 96–101. Three months ended June 30, 2018 • $278 million of net gains on assets and $504 million of net gains on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Three months ended June 30, 2017 • $176 million of net gains on assets and $145 million of net losses on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Six months ended June 30, 2018 • $1.7 billion of net gains on assets predominantly driven by market movements in derivative receivables, in particular equity derivative receivables. • $822 million of net gains on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Six months ended June 30, 2017 • $506 million of of net gains on assets and $654 million of net losses on liabilities, none of which were individually significant. Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Fair value hierarchy Total fair valueJune 30, 2018 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans $ — $ 325 $ 210 (a) $ 535 Other assets(b) — 217 823 1,040 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ — $ 542 $ 1,033 $ 1,575 Fair value hierarchy Total fair valueJune 30, 2017 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans $ — $ 292 $ 430 $ 722 Other assets — 10 245 255 Total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ — $ 302 $ 675 $ 977 (a) Of the $210 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2018, $166 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker’s price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 13% to 40% with a weighted average of 22%. (b) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative) as a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance. Of the $823 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2018, $641 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. There were no material liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2018 and 2017. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, related to financial instruments held at those dates.

Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. (a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. For a further discussion of the Firm’s methodologies for estimating the fair value of loans and lending-related commitments, refer to Valuation hierarchy on pages 156–159 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. (b) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated. June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Estimated fair value hierarchy Estimated fair value hierarchy (in billions) Carrying value(a) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value Carrying value(a) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value Wholesale lending- related commitments $ 1.1 $ — $ — $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ 1.1 $ — $ — $ 1.6 $ 1.6 (a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees. 104 The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, refer to page 157 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values As a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance and the election of the measurement alternative in the first quarter of 2018, the Firm measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in earnings. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still held as of June 30, 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be converted into Visa Class A shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is 1.6298 at June 30, 2018, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. 105 Note 3 – Fair value option For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, refer to Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transaction revenue were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. (e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. For further information regarding interest income and interest expense, refer to Note 6. 107 Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected notes. Unlike principal-protected structured notes, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at the maturity of the note, nonprincipal-protected structured notes do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal protected notes. (c) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $10.9 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(225) million and $(76) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report, and Note 20 of this Form 10-Q. Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk component The following table presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.

For a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (“specified risk management” positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes. Derivatives designated as hedges The adoption of the new hedge accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018 better aligns hedge accounting with the economics of the Firm’s risk management activities. For additional information, refer to Note 17. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. For qualifying fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings through an amortization approach over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings. 109 The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments. 111 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated balance sheets The following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.

Refer to Note 3 for further information. (b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. (c) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 112 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $41.9 billion and $45.5 billion related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. (c) Represents liquid security collateral as well as cash collateral held at third party custodians related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. (d) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. 114 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features For a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit- related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 10,796 $ 11,916 Collateral posted 9,066 9,973 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 118 $ 2,027 $ 79 $ 1,989 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 242 860 320 650 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at June 30, 2018 was not material, and there were no such transfers at December 31, 2017. 115 Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. (f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Under the new hedge accounting guidance, the initial amount of the excluded components may be amortized into income over the life of the derivative, or changes in fair value may be recognized in current period earnings. (g) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 116 As of June 30, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to impact the income statement in future periods (e.g., as adjustments to yield or to securities gains/losses). Carrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b) Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items: June 30, 2018 (in millions) Active hedging relationships Discontinued hedging relationships(d) Total Assets Investment securities - AFS $ 47,402 (c) $ (1,861) $ 488 $ (1,373) Liabilities Long-term debt $ 131,705 $ (1,413) $ (11) $ (1,424) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 7,665 — (51) (51) (a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.2 billion to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Given the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges generally will not impact the income statement in future periods. The carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is $15.4 billion and for long-term debt is $7.2 billion. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. (d) Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date. 117 Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 13 $ (33) $ (46) Foreign exchange(b) 6 (166) (172) Total $ 19 $ (199) $ (218) Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Three months ended June 30, 2017 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI(c) Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (6) $ 1 $ 7 Foreign exchange(b) (59) 22 81 Total $ (65) $ 23 $ 88 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Six months ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 26 $ (111) $ (137) Foreign exchange(b) 45 (132) (177) Total $ 71 $ (243) $ (314) Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Six months ended June 30, 2017 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI(c) Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (17) $ 12 $ 29 Foreign exchange(b) (133) 70 203 Total $ (150) $ 82 $ 232 (a) Primarily consists of benchmark interest rate hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. (c) Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(54) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2018, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately five years. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. 118 Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 2018 2017 Three months ended June 30, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI(b) Foreign exchange derivatives $ 4 $ 1,204 $ (50) $ (319) 2018 2017 Six months ended June 30, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI(b) Foreign exchange derivatives $ (7) $ 815 $ (112) $ (828) (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income. (b) Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on net investment hedges directly in income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. (c) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. For additional information, refer to Note 17. Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (25) $ 238 $ (235) $ 221 Credit(b) (3) (7) (10) (52) Foreign exchange(c) 130 (14) 100 (34) Total $ 102 $ 217 $ (145) $ 135 (a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income. (b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue. 119 Credit derivatives For a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold. (c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

(b) Amounts are shown on a gross basis, before the benefit of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received by the Firm. 120 Note 5 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense Noninterest revenue For a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm’s noninterest revenue, refer to Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The adoption of the revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018, requires gross presentation of certain costs previously offset against revenue, predominantly associated with certain distribution costs (previously offset against asset management, administration and commissions), with the remainder associated with certain underwriting costs (previously offset against investment banking fees). Adoption of the guidance did not result in any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition.

At June 30, 2018, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. As a result of the adoption of the premium amortization accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, premiums on purchased callable debt securities must be amortized to the earliest call date for debt securities with call features that are explicit, noncontingent and callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. The guidance primarily impacts obligations of U.S. states and municipalities held in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. For additional information, refer to Note 17. As permitted by the new hedge accounting guidance, the Firm also elected to transfer U.S. government agency MBS, commercial MBS, and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $22.4 billion from HTM to AFS in the first quarter of 2018.

The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. (c) Includes investment securities with no stated maturity. Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 7 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 128 Note 10 – Securities financing activities For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, refer to Note 3. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, refer to Note 21. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces the economic exposure with the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented below, if the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.

These amounts are presented within other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets. (b) Includes securities financing agreements accounted for at fair value. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, included securities purchased under resale agreements of $12.8 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $866 million and $697 million, respectively. There were $4.1 billion and $3.0 billion of securities borrowed at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value in either period. (c) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related asset or liability with that counterparty. (d) Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, included $5.2 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $30.0 billion and $25.5 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $13.4 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively, of securities sold under agreements to repurchase; and $50 million and $29 million, respectively, of securities loaned and other. 129 The tables below present as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.

These amounts are presented within other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm held $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. 130 Note 11 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value • PCI loans held-for-investment For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10- Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f) Residential real estate – excluding PCI • Residential mortgage(b) • Home equity(c) Other consumer loans(d) • Auto • Consumer & Business Banking(e) Residential real estate – PCI • Home equity • Prime mortgage • Subprime mortgage • Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial • Real estate • Financial institutions • Government agencies • Other(g) (a) Includes loans held in CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. (b) Predominantly includes prime (including option ARMs) and subprime loans. (c) Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans. (d) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes. (e) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans. (f) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions. (g) Includes loans to: individuals (predominantly Wealth Management clients within AWM), SPEs, and private education and civic organizations. For more information on SPEs, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(b) Loans (other than PCI loans and loans for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums, and net deferred loan fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. 131 The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held- for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table. 2018 2017 Three months ended June 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 532 (a)(b) $ — $ 532 $ 1,064 $ 626 (a)(b) $ — $ 594 $ 1,220 Sales 2,391 — 4,943 7,334 763 — 2,377 3,140 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale — — 392 392 31 — 307 338 2018 2017 Six months ended June 30, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 1,603 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,630 $ 3,233 $ 1,566 (a)(b) $ — $ 878 $ 2,444 Sales 2,872 — 8,632 11,504 1,353 — 4,824 6,177 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 36 — 1,260 1,296 6,340 (c) — 768 7,108 (a) Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (b) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $5.3 billion and $5.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $8.9 billion and $11.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (c) Includes the Firm’s student loan portfolio which was sold in 2017. Gains and losses on sales of loans Gains and losses on sales of loans (including adjustments to record loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in other income were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. In addition, the sale of loans may result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. In 2017, the Firm sold its student loan portfolio.

(b) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $4.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, these balances included $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. (d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (f) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. 133 Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate (in millions, except ratios) Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 HELOCs:(a) Within the revolving period(b) $ 5,455 $ 6,363 0.26% 0.50% Beyond the revolving period 12,631 13,532 2.72 3.56 HELOANs 1,190 1,371 2.77 3.50 Total $ 19,276 $ 21,266 2.03% 2.64% (a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period. (b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. (in millions) Residential mortgage Home equity Total residential real estate – excluding PCI Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Impaired loans With an allowance $ 3,816 $ 4,407 $ 1,211 $ 1,236 $ 5,027 $ 5,643 Without an allowance(a) 1,208 1,213 881 882 2,089 2,095 Total impaired loans(b)(c) $ 5,024 $ 5,620 $ 2,092 $ 2,118 $ 7,116 $ 7,738 Allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans $ 94 $ 62 $ 62 $ 111 $ 156 $ 173 Unpaid principal balance of impaired loans(d) 6,870 7,741 3,604 3,701 10,474 11,442 Impaired loans on nonaccrual status(e) 1,730 1,743 1,041 1,032 2,771 2,775 (a) Represents collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2018, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 13% of residential mortgages and 9% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due. (b) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. (c) Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. (e) At both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, nonaccrual loans included $2.2 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status refer to the Loan accounting framework in Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 134 The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Residential mortgage $ 100 $ 96 $ 247 $ 168 Home equity 83 69 186 150 Total residential real estate – excluding PCI $ 183 $ 165 $ 433 $ 318 135 Nature and extent of modifications The U.S. Treasury’s Making Home Affordable programs, as well as the Firm’s proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. (b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Also includes forbearances that meet the definition of a TDR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Forbearances suspend or reduce monthly payments for a specific period of time to address a temporary hardship. 136 Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications and does not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. At June 30, 2018, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for residential mortgage and 8 years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). Active and suspended foreclosure At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $763 million and $787 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. 137 Other consumer loans The table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto and business banking loans.

(b) For risk-rated business banking and auto loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the risk rating of the loan, including whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. 138 Other consumer impaired loans and loan modifications The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs. (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Impaired loans With an allowance $ 245 $ 272 Without an allowance(a) 26 26 Total impaired loans(b)(c) $ 271 $ 298 Allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans $ 70 $ 73 Unpaid principal balance of impaired loans(d) 373 402 Impaired loans on nonaccrual status 246 268 (a) When discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S. (c) Other consumer average impaired loans were $277 million and $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $287 million and $501 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $91 million and $102 million, respectively. New TDRs, as well as the impact of these modifications were not material to the Firm for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were not material. TDRs on nonaccrual status were $66 million and $72 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 139 Purchased credit-impaired loans For a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

(b) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (c) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. 140 Approximately 25% of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table represents the Firm’s delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

(b) Substantially all undrawn HELOCs within the revolving period have been closed. (c) Includes loans modified into fixed rate amortizing loans. The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.

Active and suspended foreclosure At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $1.2 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. Credit card loan portfolio For further information on the credit card loan portfolio, including credit quality indicators, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report.

The table below sets forth information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs. (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Impaired credit card loans with an allowance(a)(b) Credit card loans with modified payment terms(c) $ 1,191 $ 1,135 Modified credit card loans that have reverted to pre-modification payment terms(d) 61 80 Total impaired credit card loans(e) $ 1,252 $ 1,215 Allowance for loan losses related to impaired credit card loans $ 402 $ 383 (a) The carrying value and the unpaid principal balance are the same for credit card impaired loans. (b) There were no impaired loans without an allowance. (c) Represents credit card loans outstanding to borrowers enrolled in a credit card modification program as of the date presented. (d) Represents credit card loans that were modified in TDRs but that have subsequently reverted back to the loans’ pre-modification payment terms. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, $29 million and $43 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $32 million and $37 million at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers’ credit lines remain closed. (e) Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S. The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Average impaired credit card loans $ 1,244 $ 1,212 $ 1,234 $ 1,220 Interest income on impaired credit card loans 16 15 31 29 Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications under long- term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were $202 million and $176 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $425 million and $361 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. (in millions, except weighted-average data) Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 18.00% 16.55% 17.61% 16.35% Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 5.06 4.80 5.13 4.78 Loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(a) $ 25 $ 24 $ 51 $ 45 (a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.

(c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. For conduits program-wide credit enhancements, refer to note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $17.0 billion and $21.8 billion at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. (e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind, solar and other alternative energy projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $13.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, of which $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion was unfunded, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until qualification of the project for tax credits. For further information on affordable housing tax credits, refer to Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20 of this Form 10-Q. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to Customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the 149 Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to Customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, was $8.6 billion and $9.2 million, respectively. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 20. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. For a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations, refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

(e) Includes prime, Alt-A, subprime, and option ARMs. Excludes loan securitization transactions entered into with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (f) Includes commercial mortgage and other consumer loans. Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (“U.S. GSEs”). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 20 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities. 150 Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Carrying value of loans sold $ 8,076 $ 11,711 $ 16,836 $ 28,880 Proceeds received from loan sales as cash — 4 — 13 Proceeds from loan sales as securities(a) 7,959 11,602 16,578 28,589 Total proceeds received from loan sales(b) $ 7,959 $ 11,606 $ 16,578 $ 28,602 Gains on loan sales(c)(d) $ 9 $ 42 $ 23 $ 73 (a) Predominantly includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt. (b) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. (c) Gains on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (d) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 20, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 11. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Goodwill The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments. (in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Consumer & Community Banking $ 30,999 $ 31,013 Corporate & Investment Bank 6,772 6,776 Commercial Banking 2,860 2,860 Asset & Wealth Management 6,857 6,858 Total goodwill $ 47,488 $ 47,507 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.

Goodwill Impairment testing For a further description of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, refer to Impairment testing on pages 244–245 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Goodwill was not impaired at June 30, 2018, or December 31, 2017, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2018 or 2017. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. 152 Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. As of or for the three months ended June 30, As of or for the six months ended June 30, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Fair value at beginning of period $ 6,202 $ 6,079 $ 6,030 $ 6,096 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 157 154 333 371 Purchase of MSRs 79 — 146 — Disposition of MSRs(a) (104) (67) (399) (138) Net additions/(dispositions) 132 87 80 233 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (187) (213) (347) (419) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) 103 (178) 485 (121) Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) — 2 — 14 Discount rates — (7) 24 (19) Prepayment model changes and other(c) (9) (17) (31) (31) Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions (9) (22) (7) (36) Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions 94 (200) 478 (157) Fair value at June 30, $ 6,241 $ 5,753 $ 6,241 $ 5,753 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at June 30, $ 94 $ (200) $ 478 $ (157) Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 446 477 911 964 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at June 30, (in billions) 534 569 534 569 Net servicer advances at June 30, (in billions)(d) 3.3 4.1 3.3 4.1 (a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. 153 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 CCB mortgage fees and related income Net production revenue $ 93 $ 152 $ 188 $ 293 Net mortgage servicing revenue: Operating revenue: Loan servicing revenue 441 518 954 1,040 Changes in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (187) (212) (347) (417) Total operating revenue 254 306 607 623 Risk management: Changes in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a) 104 (178) 486 (121) Other changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b) (9) (22) (7) (36) Change in derivative fair value and other (118) 143 (485) 48 Total risk management (23) (57) (6) (109) Total net mortgage servicing revenue 231 249 601 514 Total CCB mortgage fees and related income 324 401 789 807 All other — 3 — 3 Mortgage fees and related income $ 324 $ 404 $ 789 $ 810 (a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. (in millions, except rates) Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”) 8.43% 9.35% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (195) $ (221) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (379) (427) Weighted-average option adjusted spread 8.72% 9.04% Impact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change $ (245) $ (250) Impact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change (472) (481) CPR: Constant prepayment rate. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. 154 Note 15 – Deposits For further information on deposits, refer to Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, noninterest- bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.

(d) The pre-tax amounts are predominantly recorded in noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense in the Consolidated statements of income. (e) The pre-tax amount is reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of income. 157 Note 18 – Restricted cash and other restricted assets For a detailed discussion of the Firm’s restricted cash and other restricted assets, refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. As a result of the adoption of the restricted cash accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, restricted cash is included with unrestricted cash when reconciling the beginning and ending cash balances on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s restricted cash: (in billions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Cash reserves – Federal Reserve Banks $ 22.8 $ 25.7 Segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers 15.3 16.8 Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes 3.2 3.3 Total restricted cash(a) $ 41.3 $ 45.8 (a) Comprises $40.0 billion and $44.8 billion in deposits with banks, and $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Also, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Firm had: • Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $18.4 billion and $18.0 billion, respectively. • Securities with a fair value of $5.2 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity. Note 19 – Regulatory capital For a detailed discussion on regulatory capital, refer to Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s insured depository institutions (“IDI”), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table represents the minimum and well- capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2018. Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios BHC(a)(e) IDI(b)(e) BHC(c) IDI(d) Capital ratios CET1 9.0% 6.375% —% 6.5% Tier 1 10.5 7.875 6.0 8.0 Total 12.5 9.875 10.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 SLR 5.0 6.0 — 6.0 Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the Transitional minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018, the CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 2.5% capital conservation buffer and 2.625%, resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 3.5% GSIB surcharge. (b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. (e) For the period ended December 31, 2017, the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 7.5%, 9.0%, 11.0% and 4.0%, and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries were 5.75%, 7.25%, 9.25% and 4.0%, respectively. 158 The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and its significant IDI subsidiaries under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, JPMorgan Chase and all of its IDI subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a further discussion of lending- related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. 160 Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments Contractual amount Carrying value(g) June 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Jun 30, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 By remaining maturity (in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after 1 year through 3 years Expires after 3 years through 5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total Lending-related Consumer, excluding credit card: Home equity $ 1,202 $ 1,163 $ 1,559 $ 16,606 $ 20,530 $ 20,360 $ 12 $ 12 Residential mortgage(a) 8,342 — — 12 8,354 5,736 — — Auto 7,770 949 187 153 9,059 9,255 2 2 Consumer & Business Banking 12,410 796 110 525 13,841 13,202 19 19 Total consumer, excluding credit card 29,724 2,908 1,856 17,296 51,784 48,553 33 33 Credit card 592,452 — — — 592,452 572,831 — — Total consumer(b) 622,176 2,908 1,856 17,296 644,236 621,384 33 33 Wholesale: Other unfunded commitments to extend credit(c) 86,217 130,739 140,327 9,395 366,678 331,160 942 840 Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(c) 14,469 8,744 7,042 1,708 31,963 35,226 593 636 Other letters of credit(c) 2,914 54 148 3,116 3,712 4 3 Total wholesale(d) 103,600 139,537 147,517 11,103 401,757 370,098 1,539 1,479 Total lending-related $ 725,776 $ 142,445 $ 149,373 $ 28,399 $ 1,045,993 $ 991,482 $ 1,572 $ 1,512 Other guarantees and commitments Securities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(e) $ 202,797 $ — $ — $ — $ 202,797 $ 179,490 $ — $ — Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 4,737 334 12,415 40,235 57,721 57,174 457 304 Unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements 102,480 — — — 102,480 76,859 — — Unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements 92,150 — — — 92,150 44,205 — — Loan sale and securitization-related indemnifications: Mortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 123 111 Loans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 1,084 1,169 33 38 Other guarantees and commitments(f) 11,754 1,458 209 2,664 16,085 11,867 (225) (76) (a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (d) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the U.S. portion of the contractual amount of total wholesale lending-related commitments was 78% and 77%, respectively. (e) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $213.7 billion and $188.7 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash and securities issued by governments that are members of G7 and U.S. government agencies. (f) At June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, primarily includes letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis, unfunded commitments related to institutional lending and commitments associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses. Additionally, includes unfunded commitments predominantly related to certain tax-oriented equity investments. (g) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. 161 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank, the Firm in part is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured clearance advance facilities that the Firm extended to its clients (i.e., cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the Firm’s intra-day credit risk to the facility amount and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of December 31, 2017 the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $1.5 billion. As of June 30, 2018 the Firm no longer offers such arrangements to its clients. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017.

For a further discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 4. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs and in certain private label transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. For additional information, refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. 162 The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Guarantees of subsidiary The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company, and these guarantees rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Note 21 – Pledged assets and collateral For a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and collateral, refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Pledged assets The Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, and cover customer short sales. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged. The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets. (in billions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 140.4 $ 135.8 Assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 76.7 68.1 Assets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 487.0 493.7 Total assets pledged $ 704.1 $ 697.6 Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm’s securities financing activities, refer to Note 10. For additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt, refer to Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Collateral The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Collateral is generally used under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover customer short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted. (in billions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Collateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,102.8 $ 968.8 Collateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 908.2 771.0 Certain prior period amounts for both collateral and pledged assets (including the corresponding pledged assets parenthetical disclosure for trading assets and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets) have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 163 Note 22 – Litigation Contingencies As of June 30, 2018, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.7 billion at June 30, 2018. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. American Depositary Receipts Pre-Release Inquiry. The Staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division has been investigating depositary banks and broker-dealers, including the Firm, in connection with activity relating to pre-released American Depositary Receipts. The Staff’s investigation focuses on the period of 2011 to 2015. The Firm has been cooperating with this investigation. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX- related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter. The Firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.- based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the “U.S. class action”). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the “exchanged-based actions”), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”), participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the “ERISA actions”), and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions. The Court granted final approval of that settlement agreement in May 2018. Certain members of the settlement class have filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class. 164 The District Court has dismissed one of the ERISA actions, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that dismissal in July 2018. The District Court has also dismissed the indirect purchaser action, and the plaintiffs have sought leave to replead their complaint. The consumer action and a second ERISA action remain pending in the District Court. General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated Term Loan facility (“Term Loan”) for General Motors Corporation (“GM”). In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (“Creditors Committee”) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal of the Creditors Committee’s claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In connection with that additional collateral, a trial in the Bankruptcy Court regarding the value of certain representative assets concluded in May 2017, and a ruling was issued in September 2017. The Bankruptcy Court found that 33 of the 40 representative assets are fixtures and that these fixtures generally should be valued on a “going concern” basis. The Creditors Committee is seeking leave to appeal the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling that the fixtures should be valued on a “going concern” basis rather than on a liquidation basis. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. seeking indemnification and asserting various claims. The parties have engaged in mediation concerning, among other things, the characterization and value of the remaining additional collateral, in light of the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling regarding the representative assets, as well as other issues, including the cross-claims. In July 2018, the parties informed the Bankruptcy Court that, at this time, they do not believe that they will be able to reach a global settlement of the adversary proceeding through mediation, and that they intend to present the Bankruptcy Court with a proposed schedule for ongoing litigation. The parties will continue to mediate specific disputes involving certain issues, principally relating to whether certain of the additional collateral should be characterized as fixtures. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws. The parties settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed the settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. In March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined petitions seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. The parties to the class action seeking monetary relief have reached a settlement agreement in principle, subject to documentation and court approval, and are engaged in ongoing negotiations. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates was submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rates (“EURIBOR”) and to the Japanese Bankers’ Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (“TIBOR”) during similar time periods, as well as processes for the setting of U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods, including through 2012. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations to the extent that they are ongoing. The Firm has recently reached a resolution with the CFTC concerning the CFTC’s U.S. dollar ISDAFIX- related investigation. As previously reported, the Firm has resolved EC inquiries relating to Yen LIBOR and Swiss Franc 165 LIBOR. In December 2016, the Firm resolved ComCo inquiries relating to these same rates. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various United States District Courts. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation. The Firm has agreed to settle putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts, Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate. Those settlements are all subject to further documentation and court approval. In an action related to EURIBOR, the District Court dismissed all claims except a single antitrust claim and two common law claims, and dismissed all defendants except the Firm and Citibank. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted antitrust claims, claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims to proceed. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. In February 2018, the District Court (i) granted class certification with respect to certain antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, (ii) denied class certification with respect to state common law claims brought by the holders of those bonds and swaps and (iii) denied class certification with respect to two other putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts and LIBOR- based loans held by plaintiff lending institutions. The Firm and another defendant have petitioned for leave to appeal the class certification of the antitrust claims related to bonds and swaps, and plaintiffs have petitioned for leave to appeal the denial of class certification as to exchange- traded Eurodollar futures contracts. In July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the plaintiff lending institutions’ petition for leave to appeal the denial of their motion for class certification. In an action related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, the District Court dismissed without prejudice all claims except a single antitrust claim, and dismissed without prejudice all defendants except the Firm, Bank of America and Citibank. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2017, which the Firm and other defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm is one of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. In April 2016, the Firm settled this litigation, along with certain other banks. Those settlements have been preliminarily approved by the Court. Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3.0 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the “Plan of Adjustment”), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment’s effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending. Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (“OEP”), were named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, “Petters”) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates were brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three Petters entities. These actions generally sought to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered 166 into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. In January 2017, the Court substantially denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss an amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. In October 2017, JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates reached an agreement to settle the litigation brought by the Petters bankruptcy trustees, or their successors, and the receiver for Thomas J. Petters. The settlement has received Court approval. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. The Firm has been successful in legal challenges made to the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, with respect to the criminal proceedings. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Firm is requesting clarification from the Court of Cassation concerning the Court of Appeal’s decision before seeking direction on next steps in the criminal proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense for litigation and investigations was $0 million and $61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. 167 Note 23 – Business segments The Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments, refer to Segment results below, and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. For additional information on business segment capital allocation, refer to Line of business equity on pages 88-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1. Net income in 2018 for the business segments reflects the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 27, 2018, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. Basis for Review Results These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. August 1, 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017 170 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract.

However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. Subprime Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan. MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas MSR: Mortgage servicing rights NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented. Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/ (recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period. Net interchange income includes the following components: • Interchange income: A fee paid to a credit card issuer in the clearing and settlement of a sales or cash advance transaction. • Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs. • Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions. 175 Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds. NM: Not meaningful NOL: Net operating loss Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property. OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss) OEP: One Equity Partners OIS: Overnight index swap OPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit OTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.

OTTI: Other-than-temporary impairment Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue. Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Participating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends. PCA: Prompt corrective action PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. PD: Probability of default PRA: Prudential Regulatory Authority Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses. Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market- making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk- management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. PSU(s): Performance share units Receivables from customers: primarily represents margin loans to brokerage customers that are collateralized through assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts, as such no allowance is held against these receivables. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Regulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules. REO: Real estate owned Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments. Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value). Revenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan 176 syndications.

RHS: Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. S&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 Index SAR(s): Stock appreciation rights SCCL: Single-counterparty credit limits Scored portfolio: The scored portfolio predominantly includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans and certain auto and business banking loans where credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time. The statistical analysis uses portfolio modeling, credit scoring and decision-support tools. SEC: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment. Single-name: Single reference-entities SLR: Supplementary leverage ratio SMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securities SPEs: Special purpose entities Structural interest rate risk: represents interest rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of the Firm. Structured notes: Structured notes are predominantly financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. Where present, the embedded derivative is the primary driver of risk. Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial and non-judicial states. Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. TBVPS: Tangible book value per share TCE: Tangible common equity TDR: “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty. TLAC: Total Loss Absorbing Capacity U.K.: United Kingdom Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion. U.S.: United States of America U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

U.S. GSEs include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but do not include Ginnie Mae, which is directly owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. U.S. GSE obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury VA: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VaR: “Value-at-risk” is a measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/ accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 180 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. For a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to the Market Risk Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis and pages 121-128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls do occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 146 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting. Part II – Other Information Item 1. Legal Proceedings. For information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, refer to the discussion of the Firm’s material legal proceedings in Note 22 of this Form 10-Q. Item 1A. Risk Factors. For a discussion of certain risk factors affecting the Firm, refer to Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 8–26 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Forward-Looking Statements on page 83 of this Form 10-Q. Supervision and regulation For information on Supervision and Regulation, refer to Recent regulatory developments on page 44 of this Form 10-Q and the Supervision and regulation section on pages 1–8 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2017 Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. The Firm did not have any unregistered sale of equity securities during the three months ended June 30, 2018. Repurchases under the common equity repurchase program Following receipt in June 2018 of the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to the Firm’s 2018 capital plan, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $20.7 billion of common equity (common stock and warrants) between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s equity-based compensation plans. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. There were no warrants repurchased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Total shares of common stock repurchased 45.3 35.0 86.7 67.1 Aggregate common stock repurchases $ 4,968 $ 3,007 $ 9,639 $ 5,839 The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading blackout periods. All purchases under Rule 10b5-1 plans must be made according to predefined plans established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; maybe executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. 181 Shares repurchased pursuant to the common equity repurchase program during the six months ended June 30, 2018, were as follows.
