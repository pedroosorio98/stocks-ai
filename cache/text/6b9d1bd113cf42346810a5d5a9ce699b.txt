Regulation FD Disclosure In January 2021, Microsoft announced a minority investment in Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors Company (&#8220;GM&#8221;). On December&#160;10, 2024, GM announced its intent to realign its autonomous driving strategy, no longer fund Cruise&#8217;s robotaxi development work, and pursue the acquisition of minority investor shares. As a result, we expect to record an impairment charge of approximately $800&#160;million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. This charge will be recorded in other income and expense and was not included in our second quarter guidance provided on October&#160;30, 2024. It is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately $0.09 to second quarter diluted earnings per share.
