Profitability $0.4B GAAP operating income $0.4B GAAP net income $0.9B non-GAAP net income 1 In Q1, we accomplished an industry first: simultaneously changing over production lines across all factories for the world’s best -selling vehicle 4 – the Model Y. The Tesla team successfully ramped our production lines across four factories while managing supply chains across three continents without any major disruptions, demonstrating the advancement of our operational and supply chain management capabilities. AI is a major pillar of growth for Tesla and the broader economy and key to our pursuit of sustainable abundance. Furthermore, AI infrastructure is driving rapid load growth, which, along with traditional utility customer applications, is creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity. While the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive, we are taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long -term and focus on maintaining its health. Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers. This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near -term. We remain committed to expanding our business model to include delivering autonomous robots across multiple form factors and use cases – powered by our real -world AI expertise – to our customers and for use in our factories, as we navigate these headwinds. In the face of near -term profitability hurdles, the low -cost, localized manufacturing base that we have built provides advantages in delivering the best products at the right price to our customers globally. We continue to make critical, high -value investments while maintaining a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.

F I N A N C I A L S U M M A R Y Revenue Total revenue decreased 9% YoY to $19.3B. YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: - decline in vehicle deliveries, in part due to the Model Y update across all four vehicle factories - reduced vehicle average selling price (ASP) (excl. FX impact 1), due to mix and sales incentives - negative FX impact of $0.3B 1 + growth in Energy Generation and Storage and Services and Other + higher regulatory credit revenue Profitability Our operating income decreased 66% YoY to $0.4B, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impac ted by the following items: - reduced vehicle ASP - decline in vehicle deliveries - increase in operating expenses driven by AI and other R&D projects partially offset by a decrease in SG&A + growth in Energy Generation and Storage gross profit + lower cost associated with Cybertruck production ramp in Q1’24 + lower cost per vehicle, including lower raw material costs partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption primarily from M odel Y production decrease YoY + higher regulatory credit revenue Cash Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments was $37.0B. The sequential increase of $0.4B was primarily the result of posi tive free cash flow of $0.7B. 5 (1) Impact is calculated on a constant currency basis. Actuals are compared against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from Q1’24.

Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime, component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors. Construction includes factory and infrastructure buildout as well as tool installation. Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM) Source: Tesla estimates based on latest available data from ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM – light- duty vehicles only; TTM = Trailing twelve months; Q1 data for Europe unavailable as of 4/22/25.(1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous As guided, switchover of production lines for the New Model Y resulted in several weeks of lost production. During the switchover, we also prepared our factories for the launch of new models later this year. Given economic uncertainty resulting from changing trade policy, more affordable options are as critical as ever. US: California, Nevada and Texas In April, Gigafactory Texas produced its 400,000 th vehicle and the team launched the Long Range Cybertruck with 362 miles of range, starting under $63k after incentives. Gigafactory Nevada achieved record battery pack production. Model 3 and Model Y deliveries in the U.S. are now made with 100% U.S.- built battery packs. We continued progress on the installation of lines for Tesla Semi in Nevada and the Cybercab in Texas. Both remain on track for volume production next year. APAC: Shanghai We achieved record orders for a single day in the APAC region when we launched New Model Y. This is significant given the region is the most competitive EV market and is also a validation of our cost structure and competitive positioning. While conventional wisdom is that competition will be bad for Tesla, we have long believed that it accelerates broader EV adoption and is positive for our sales long -term. The Shanghai Model Y factory fully ramped production in six - weeks, our quickest ramp of any vehicle ever. We launched FSD (Supervised) 1 in China – the first market outside of North America – with positive reception. Europe and the Middle East: Berlin- Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin built its 500,000 th Model Y. We plan to begin deliveries of Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck later this year in Saudi Arabia – the first Cybertruck market outside of North America. We continue to prepare for the launch of FSD (Supervised) 1 in Europe this year, pending regulatory approval. 7 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% US/Canada Europe China Model Y driving autonomously (unsupervised) to outbound lot at GFTX C O R E T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised)1 (billions) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware We believe that our approach to autonomy – a vision-only architecture with end -to-end neural networks trained on billions of examples of real -world data – will result in scalable and safe deployment across diverse geographies and use cases. This was validated with the launch of FSD (Supervised)1 in China, which was achieved without access to country -specific training data. Model 3, Model Y and Cybertruck now drive autonomously – without human supervision – from the production line to the outbound logistics lot at our U.S. factories. We remain on track for pilot launch of Robotaxi in Austin by June and builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories. Vehicle and Other Software A major benefit of our software -defined products is continual improvement of functionality through over-the-air updates. Recent updates to eligible vehicles include Adaptive Headlights to prevent glare for other road occupants by selectively dimming individual pixels of the headlight and Rear Cross- Traffic Chime that emits a warning sound from the direction of a crossing vehicle or pedestrian while reversing. In China, we launched our own interactive Onboarding Tutorial app to improve the customer delivery experience. Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing We launched an IRA- compliant 4680 cell, making the Cybertruck eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. Building on our efforts to reduce supply risk, we have developed our 4680 supply to ensure each component is sourced from at least two countries of origin. Our lithium refining and cathode production plants are on track to start production in 2025, on- shoring production of critical battery materials to the U.S. 8 (1) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 FSD Miles on V12 and Beyond FSD Miles on V11 and Before E N E R G Y & S E R V I C E S A N D O T H E R Energy Storage deployments (TTM; GWh) Energy and Services and Other gross profit (TTM; $M) Energy storage deployments continued to grow on a trailing twelve -month (TTM) basis. While we expect sequential deployments to remain volatile, we anticipate that expanding capacity for both Powerwall and Megapack will drive continued growth in TTM deployment volumes. Although increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near -term impacts to supply and demand, we see electrification of the economy and growth of AI increasing the need for energy storage as a source of base load and grid stability. Energy Generation and Storage We achieved a fourth sequential record for Powerwall deployments, crossing 1 GWh for the first time, and continue to be supply constrained. Gross margin for the Energy Business improved sequentially. Megafactory Shanghai volumes did not contribute to quarterly deployments; however, the factory produced over 100 Megapacks, with the Megapacks en- route to a customer. With a highly localized supply chain, 20 GWh of current annual capacity and the ability to double to 40 GWh, Megafactory Shanghai will be an important asset for meeting global energy storage demand during a time of uncertain cost structure in the U.S. Services and Other Services and Other gross profit grew 25% year -over-year, thanks to improvement in non- warranty maintenance service and collision gross profit. We opened over 1,800 new Supercharging stalls, growing the network 17% year -over-year. We delivered 1.4 TWh of electricity to Tesla and non -Tesla customers across 42 million charging sessions, year -over-year growth of 26% and 27%, respectively. 9 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 -1,000 -500 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 O U T L O O K Volume It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost s tructure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration o f our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment. We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hard ware- related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits. Product Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. This approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This should help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 60% growth over 2024 production before investing in new manufacturing lines. Our purpose-built Robotaxi product – Cybercab – will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy and is scheduled for volume production starting in 2026. 10 P H O T O S & C H A R T S N E W M O D E L Y D E L I V E R Y E V E N T - G I G A F A C T O R Y T E X A S 12 N E W M O D E L Y D E L I V E R Y E V E N T - G I G A F A C T O R Y T E X A S 13 N E W M O D E L Y D E L I V E R Y E V E N T - G I G A F A C T O R Y S H A N G H A I 14 N E W M O D E L Y D E L I V E R Y E V E N T - G I G A F A C T O R Y B E R L I N – B R A N D E N B U R G 15 N E W M O D E L Y D E L I V E R Y E V E N T - F R E M O N T F A C T O R Y 16 T E S L A D I N E R - C O M I N G S O O N 17 S E M I F A C T O R Y - C O N S T R U C T I O N P R O G R E S S C O N T I N U E D I N Q 1 18 C Y B E R T R U C K - F I V E S T A R C R A S H S A F E T Y R A T I N G 19 P O W E R W A L L 3 R A M P - 1 , 5 0 0 U N I T S I N A S I N G L E S H I F T M I L E S T O N E 20 M E G A F A C T O R Y S H A N G H A I - F I R S T M E G A P A C K O F F T H E L I N E 21 O P T I M U S - F R E M O N T P I L O T P R O D U C T I O N L I N E 22 Vehicle Deliveries (millions of units) K E Y M E T R I C S Q U A R T E R L Y (Unaudited) Operating Cash Flow ($B) Free Cash Flow ($B) (1) Net Income ($B) (2) Adjusted EBITDA ($B) (2) (3) 23 (1) Beginning in Q1'25, Capital expenditures is presented inclusive of purchases of solar energy systems and all prior periods ha ve been adjusted.

A D D I T I O N A L I N F O R M A T I O N WEBCAST INFORMATION Tesla will provide a live webcast of its first quarter 2025 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on April 22, 2025 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. “Net income attributable to common stockholders (non-GAAP)" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) stock-based compensation expense, net of tax and (b) digital assets loss (gain), net of tax. "Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)" is equal to (i) net income attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment, (d) stock-based compensation expense and (e) digital assets loss (gain), net. "Free cash flow" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant period's deliveries and using trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories and refinery are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
