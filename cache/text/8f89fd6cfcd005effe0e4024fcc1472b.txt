News Release 2 In the discussion of results below of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm and of its business segments, information is presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see page 5. Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the third quarter of 2016 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified. JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Net revenue on a reported basis totaled $24.7 billion, $24.4 billion, and $22.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, second quarter of 2016, and third quarter of 2015, respectively. Results for JPM 2Q16 3Q15 ($ millions, except per share data) 3Q16 2Q16 3Q15 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net revenue - managed $ 25,512 $ 25,214 $ 23,535 $ 298 1% $ 1,977 8% Noninterest expense 14,463 13,638 15,368 825 6 (905) (6) Provision for credit losses 1,271 1,402 682 (131) (9) 589 86 Net income $ 6,286 $ 6,200 $ 6,804 $ 86 1% $ (518) (8)% Earnings per share $ 1.58 $ 1.55 $ 1.68 $ 0.03 2% $ (0.10) (6)% Return on tangible common equity 13% 13% 15% Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.3 billion, a decrease of 8%. Net revenue was $25.5 billion, up 8%. Net interest income was $11.9 billion, up 6%, primarily driven by loan growth and the net impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower investment securities balances. Noninterest revenue was $13.6 billion, up 10%, primarily driven by the Corporate & Investment Bank. Noninterest expense was $14.5 billion, down 6%, driven by lower legal expense, partially offset by higher compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, up from $682 million, due to reserve increases in the current quarter versus reserve releases in the prior-year quarter, and higher net charge-offs. The Consumer provision reflected an increase in reserves of approximately $225 million, primarily driven by growth in the Card portfolio, including growth in newer vintages which, as expected, have higher loss rates compared to the overall portfolio. The Wholesale provision was a benefit, primarily driven by net reserve releases in the Oil & Gas portfolio of approximately $50 million. Net income reflects higher income tax expense in the current quarter. The prior-year quarter included tax benefits of $2.2 billion due to the resolution of tax audits and the release of deferred taxes. CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (CCB) Results for CCB 2Q16 3Q15 ($ millions) 3Q16 2Q16 3Q15 $ O/(U) O/(U) % $ O/(U) O/(U) % Net revenue $ 11,328 $ 11,451 $ 10,879 $ (123) (1)% $ 449 4% Consumer & Business Banking 4,719 4,616 4,555 103 2 164 4 Mortgage Banking 1,874 1,921 1,555 (47) (2) 319 21 Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto 4,735 4,914 4,769 (179) (4) (34) (1) Noninterest expense 6,510 6,004 6,237 506 8 273 4 Provision for credit losses 1,294 1,201 389 93 8 905 233 Net income $ 2,204 $ 2,656 $ 2,630 $ (452) (17)% $ (426) (16)% Discussion of Results: Net income was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 16%. Net revenue was $11.3 billion, up 4% over the prior year. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $4.7 billion, up 4%, reflecting strong deposit growth, partially offset by spread compression. Mortgage Banking net revenue was $1.9 billion, up 21%, driven by higher MSR risk management results, higher JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 production margins, and portfolio growth. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net revenue was $4.7 billion, down 1%, driven by new account origination costs, an increase in the reserve for uncollectible interest and fees, and the impact of renegotiated card co-brand partnership agreements, predominantly offset by higher auto lease and card sales volumes and higher loan balances. Noninterest expense was $6.5 billion, an increase of 4%, including two items totaling $175 million in the current quarter related to liabilities from a merchant in bankruptcy and a modest increase in reserves for mortgage servicing. The increase in expense also includes higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing expense together totaling approximately $250 million. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, an increase of $905 million, primarily reflecting a reserve build of $225 million, including $200 million for Card and $25 million for Auto, compared with a release of $575 million in Mortgage Banking in the prior-year quarter.

Banking revenue was $2.9 billion, up 6%, driven by higher Investment Banking revenue, up 14%, reflecting higher debt and equity underwriting fees as well as higher advisory fees. The business continued to rank #1 in Global Investment Banking fees. Treasury Services revenue was $917 million, up 2%. Lending revenue was $283 million, down 15%. Markets & Investor Services revenue was $6.5 billion, up 21%, driven by higher Markets revenue, up 33%. Fixed Income Markets revenue was up 48% reflecting broad based strength across products. Rates performance was particularly strong, with good client activity, as markets remained active throughout the quarter, post the Brexit vote and in anticipation of Central bank actions as well as money market reform. Credit and Securitized Products revenue was also higher, driven by improving market sentiment across primary and secondary markets which produced robust issuance volumes and strong client trading activity. Equity Markets revenue was up 1%, compared to a strong prior-year quarter reflecting continued strength in Asia and strength in North America derivatives, offset by weakness in cash equities volumes. Securities Services revenue remained flat from the prior year. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $149 million, primarily driven by derivative valuation adjustments, compared with a $154 million gain in the prior-year quarter which included funding spread gains on fair value elected liabilities. Noninterest expense was $4.9 billion, down 20%, driven by lower legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $67 million, down $165 million from the prior year. The current quarter reflected a lower reserve build in the Oil & Gas portfolio when compared with the prior-year quarter.

News Release 4 Discussion of Results: Net income was $778 million, an increase of 50%. Net revenue was $1.9 billion, up 14%, driven by higher net interest income due to loan growth and higher deposit spreads, and higher investment banking revenue driven by large transactions. Noninterest expense was $746 million, up 4%, due to investments in technology and increased hiring of bankers and business- related support staff. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $121 million, compared to an expense of $82 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by reserve releases, largely in the Oil & Gas portfolio due to loan sales. Other than the Oil & Gas portfolio, credit quality remains strong and the commercial real estate portfolio experienced no net-charge-offs during the quarter.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 1. Notes on key performance measures and non-GAAP financial measures: Notes on key performance measures a. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are considered key financial performance measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation of common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. b. Core loans include loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. For further information on total loans and core loans, see pages 3, 12, 16, 19, 21 and 23 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. c. Estimated as of September 30, 2016. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital rules, to which the Firm will be subject as of January 1, 2019, are each considered key regulatory capital measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Capital Management on pages 149-158 of the Firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and pages 63-69 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures d. In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These non-GAAP financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. e. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense (a benefit of $71 million in the third quarter of 2016). The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and U.S. and non- U.S. government entities, including U.S. states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents credit provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking.
