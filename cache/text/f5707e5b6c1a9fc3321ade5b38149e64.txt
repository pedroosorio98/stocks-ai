Even after the First Republic transaction, we maintained an extraordinarily strong CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% and had $1.4 trillion in cash and marketable securities. While we expect material capital changes with the finalization of Basel III and probable changes to come for bank liquidity, we will manage to any new requirements as we have demonstrated in the past; however, we caution that material regulatory changes would likely have real world consequences for markets and end users.” Dimon continued: “Almost all of our lines of business saw continued growth in the quarter. In Consumer & Community Banking, new checking account production was very strong, while card loans were up 18%. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Investment Banking fees remained challenged, although we gained market share YTD. In Commercial Banking, Payments revenue remained very strong and grew 79%. Finally, Asset & Wealth Management had record long-term inflows of $61 billion, with inflows across channels, regions, and asset classes.” Dimon added: “The U.S. economy continues to be resilient. Consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and consumers are spending, albeit a little more slowly. Labor markets have softened somewhat, but job growth remains strong. That being said, there are still salient risks in the immediate view—many of which I have written about over the past year. Consumers are slowly using up their cash buffers, core inflation has been stubbornly high (increasing the risk that interest rates go higher, and stay higher for longer), quantitative tightening of this scale has never occurred, fiscal deficits are large, and the war in Ukraine continues, which in addition to the huge humanitarian crisis for Ukrainians, has large potential effects on geopolitics and the global economy. While we cannot predict with any certainty how these factors will play out, we are currently managing the Firm to reliably meet the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.” Dimon concluded: “I want to welcome our new First Republic colleagues and thank all of our employees. They did an extraordinary job serving our new First Republic clients, and they worked around the clock to onboard an unprecedented number of new clients across all lines of business as a result of the recent banking turmoil. The efforts by our employees also enabled us to extend credit and raise $1.2 trillion in capital in the first half of 2023 for businesses, governments, and U.S. consumers.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 2Q23 results included: n $2.7 billion First Republic8 bargain purchase gain in Corporate ($0.91 increase in earnings per share (EPS)) n $1.2 billion net credit reserve build for First Republic ($0.30 decrease in EPS) n $900 million net investment securities losses in Corporate ($0.23 decrease in EPS) n Excluding significant items2: 2Q23 net income of $13.3 billion, EPS of $4.37 and ROTCE of 23% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $2.9 billion or $1.00 per share n $1.8 billion of common stock net repurchases9 n Net payout LTM 9,10 of 32% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $98.11, up 14%; tangible book value per share2 of $79.90, up 15% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $236 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 13.8%; Advanced ratio3 of 13.9% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.8% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 2Q23 expense of $20.8 billion; reported overhead ratio of 50%; managed overhead ratio2 of 49% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $1.2 trillion of credit and capital11 raised YTD n $120 billion of credit for consumers n $17 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $520 billion of credit for corporations n $535 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $24 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities Exhibit 99.1 JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the second quarter of 2023 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

NII excluding Markets 2 was $22.4 billion, up 63%, or up 57% excluding First Republic, predominantly driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $20.5 billion, up 25%, or up 6% excluding First Republic, predominantly driven by higher CIB Markets noninterest revenue and the absence of certain losses in Payments in the prior year, partially offset by higher net investment securities losses in Corporate. Noninterest expense was $20.8 billion, up 11%, or up 8% excluding First Republic, driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and wage inflation, as well as technology and marketing investments and higher legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion. Excluding First Republic, the provision was $1.7 billion, reflecting net charge- offs of $1.4 billion and a net reserve build of $326 million. The net reserve build included $389 million in Commercial Banking and $200 million in Card Services, partially offset by a $243 million release in Corporate . Net charge-offs of $1.4 billion were up $754 million, largely driven by Card Services. Net income attributable to First Republic was $2.4 billion in the quarter. This included an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, and a provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion to establish a reserve for the acquired First Republic lending portfolio. During the two month s ending June 30, 2023, there was an additional $897 million of net interest income, $436 million of noninterest revenue and $599 million of expense that were attributable to First Republic .

Net revenue was $17.2 billion, up 37%, or up 31% excluding First Republic. Banking & Wealth Management net revenue was $10.9 billion, up 68%, or up 59% excluding First Republic, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances. Home Lending net revenue was $1.0 billion, up 1%, or down 23% excluding First Republic, driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue . Card Services & Auto net revenue was $5.3 billion , up 5%, largely driven by higher Card Services net interest income on higher revolving balances, largely offset by lower auto operating lease income and card net interchange. Noninterest expense was $8.3 billion , up 9%, or up 8% excluding First Republic, largely driven by higher compensation, including wage inflation and headcount growth as the Firm continues to invest in front office and technology staffing, as well as higher marketing, partially offset by lower auto lease depreciation. The provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion and included a $408 million reserve established for the First Republic portfolio. Excluding First Republic, the provision was $1.5 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $1.3 billion. The net reserve build of $203 million was predominantly driven by loan growth in Card Services and changes in specific macroeconomic factors, largely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. Net charge-offs of $1.3 billion were up $640 million YoY, predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 98.11, $94.34 and $ 86.38 at June 30, 2023 , March 31, 2023 , and June 30, 2022 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K. d. Second-quarter 2023 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Significant items collectively refer to the bargain purchase gain associated with First Republic of $2.7 billion, the net credit reserve build associated with First Republic of $1.2 billion and net investment securities losses of $900 million. Excluding these significant items resulted in a decrease of $1.1 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $14.5 billion to $13.3 billion; a decrease of $0.38 per share to reported EPS from $4.75 to $4.37; and a decrease of 2% to ROTCE from 25% to 23%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.

In the second quarter of 2023, expense attributable to First Republic was substantially all in Corporate. 9. Includes the net impact of employee issuances. 10. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 11. Credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and lending-related commitments. 12. In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 13. The bridge book consists of certain held-for-sale positions, including unfunded commitments, in CIB. 14.
