This quarter we once again benefited from a significant reserve release as the environment continues to improve, but as we have said before, we do not consider these core or recurring profits. Our earnings, not including the reserve release, were $9.6 billion. Consumer and wholesale balance sheets remain exceptionally strong as the economic outlook continues to improve. In particular, net charge-offs, down 53%, were better than expected, reflecting the increasingly healthy condition of our customers and clients.” Dimon continued: “In Consumer & Community Banking, combined debit and credit card spend was up 45%, or up 22% versus the more normal, pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. We saw accelerating growth across categories including in travel and entertainment, which returned to growth in June, up 13% vs. 2019. Originations in Home Lending, up 64% to $40 billion, and Auto, up 61% to $12 billion, remained very strong. However, CCB loans were down 3% reflecting elevated prepayments in mortgage and lower Card balances. Deposits were up 25%, and investment assets were up 36%, driven by market appreciation and positive net flows. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Global IB fees are at an all-time high of $3.6 billion, up 25%, driven by an active M&A market as well as acquisition financing in DCM. Markets revenue, down 30% compared to a record last year, was up 25% versus 2019 on strong client activity. Similarly, Commercial Banking earned gross IB revenue of $1.2 billion, up 37%. In Asset & Wealth Management, AUM of $3 trillion grew 21% driven by higher asset values and strong net inflows, and loans were up 21% primarily driven by securities-based lending.” Dimon continued: “We are constantly investing, innovating and making strategic, add- on acquisitions to better serve our employees, customers and communities. In the first half of 2021, we extended credit and raised $1.7 trillion in capital for businesses, institutional clients, and U.S. customers. We are executing on our commitments to advance economic opportunity and racial equity and launched a new initiative focused on improving healthcare for our employees and the communities we serve.” Dimon concluded: “Our longstanding capital hierarchy remains the same – first and foremost, to invest in and grow our market-leading businesses to support our clients, customers and communities – even in the most difficult of times, second, to pay a sustainable dividend which we have already announced we are increasing, and third, to return any remaining excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks which we plan to continue under our existing authorization.” SIGNIFICANT ITEM n 2Q21 results included: n $3.0 billion of credit reserve releases Firmwide ($0.75 increase in earnings per share (EPS)) n Excluding credit reserve releases2: 2Q21 net income of $9.6 billion, EPS of $3.03 and ROTCE of 18% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $2.7 billion, or $0.90 per share n $5.9 billion of common stock net repurchases in 2Q21 5, 9 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $84.85, up 10%; tangible book value per share 2 of $68.91, up 12% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 3 of $209 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 13.0%; Advanced ratio3 of 13.8% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.4% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 2Q21 reported expense of $17.7 billion; reported overhead ratio of 58%; managed overhead ratio2 of 56% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $1.7 trillion of credit and capital10 raised YTD n $151 billion of credit for consumers n $10 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $656 billion of credit for corporations n $879 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $32 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities n $11 billion of loans under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) YTD JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Reggie Chambers (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the second quarter of 2021 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue of $31.4 billion was down 7%. Noninterest revenue was $18.5 billion, down 7%, driven by lower CIB Markets revenue and $678 million of markups on held-for-sale positions in the bridge book12 recorded in the prior year, largely offset by higher Investment Banking fees in CIB, higher Card income and higher AWM management fees. Net interest income was $12.9 billion, down 8%, predominantly driven by lower net interest income in CIB Markets and lower loans in Card. Noninterest expense was $17.7 billion, up 4%, largely driven by continued investments in the business including technology and front office hiring. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $2.3 billion driven by net reserve releases of $3.0 billion and $734 million of net charge-offs, compared to an expense of $10.5 billion in the prior year predominantly driven by net reserve builds of $8.9 billion. The net reserve release was driven by improvements in the Firm’s economic outlook. The net reserve release comprised of $2.6 billion in Consumer – predominantly driven by $1.8 billion in Card and $600 million in Home Lending – and $442 million in Wholesale. Net charge-offs of $734 million were down $826 million on decreases in both Consumer, predominantly in Card, and in Wholesale. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 84.85, $82.31 and $ 76.91 at June 30, 2021 , March 31, 2021 , and June 30, 2020 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. Second-quarter 2021 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding credit reserve releases (“significant item”) are non-GAAP financial measures. The credit reserve releases represent the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. Excluding credit reserve releases resulted in a decrease of $2.3 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $11.9 billion to $9.6 billion; a decrease of $0.75 per share to reported EPS from $3.78 to $3.03; and a decrease of 5% to ROTCE from 23% to 18%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
