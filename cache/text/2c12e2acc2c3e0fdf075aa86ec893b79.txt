The base of SME customers almost tripled during 2021, growing from 0.5 million as of December 31, 2020 to 1.4 million as of December 31, 2021. Activity Rate increased 10.7 pp to 76.3% from 65.6% as of December 31, 2020, mainly driven by the introduction of new products and features, and by the overall maturation of Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts, with customers continuing to migrate more of their financial lives to the Company&rsquo;s platform. Purchase Volume reached $14.3 billion in Q4'21, increasing 88.2% YoY, or 95.9% YoY on an FX neutral basis. Volume expansion was driven by both growth in Nu&rsquo;s customer base, as well as the maturation of Nu&rsquo;s existing customers cohorts, whose purchase volume per monthly active customer continued to expand. In 2021, purchase volume rose to $43.8 billion , increasing 94.7% , or 101.8% YoY on an FX neutral basis, driven primarily by the same factors. &nbsp; &nbsp; Deposits stood at $9.7 billion at year-end 2021, increasing 73.2% YoY, or 86.5% YoY on an FX neutral basis. Deposit expansion was mainly due to growth in Nu&rsquo;s customer base. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest-Earning Portfolio reached $2.0 billion at year-end 2021, increasing 317.5% YoY, or 343.5% YoY on an FX neutral basis. Growth was driven primarily by the ramp up of personal loans and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of new consumer finance products, including purchase financing, boleto (bank slip) financing and bill refinancing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Monthly Average Revenue per Active Customer (ARPAC) reached $5.6 in Q4'21, increasing 66.2% YoY or 71.8% YoY on an FX neutral basis, mostly driven by the maturation of Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts and the rollout of new products. For the year 2021, ARPAC was $4.5 , up 24.3% YoY, or 28.6% YoY on an FX Neutral basis. Growth in the number of customers combined with higher levels of engagement drove ARPAC in both periods. As shown in the analysis below, Nu&rsquo;s customer cohorts keep expanding the ratios and velocity of primary banking accounts, number of products per active customer, and monthly ARPAC. &nbsp; Compounding Effect of More Engagement and More Products &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Monthly Average Cost to Serve Per Active Customer reached $0.9 in Q4'21, declining 22.5% YoY or 20.4% YoY on an FX neutral basis, reflecting a reduction in transactional expenses per customer through better pricing terms and a structural shift in the mix of transactions. The reduction in the Cost to Serve per Active Customer was achieved despite higher transaction volumes and additional investments in customer support services to further enhance and differentiate Nu's customer experience. In 2021, average Cost to Serve per Active Customer was $0.8 , down 34.1% YoY, or 31.9% YoY on an FX Neutral basis. Non-Performing Loans Delinquency rates have remained below both Nu's historical averages and average industry levels. Growth Has Not Come At the Expense Of Asset Quality &nbsp; Note: &lsquo;Consumer Finance&rsquo; includes both credit card and personal loans balance. The information presented is for Brazil only.

In 2021, Revenue was $1.7 billion , setting a record for the Company and representing increases of 130.4% YoY, or 138.0% YoY on an FX neutral basis. Revenue ($ million) Q4'21 Q4'20 FY'21 FY'20 Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments 439.5 89.6 1,046.7 382.9 Fee and Commission Income 196.4 112.9 651.3 354.2 Total 635.9 202.6 1,698.0 737.1 FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments 439.5 86.8 1,046.7 370.6 Fee and Commission Income 196.4 109.3 651.3 342.7 Total 635.9 196.1 1,698.0 713.3 &nbsp; In Q4'21, Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments was $439.5 million , an increase of 390.5% YoY, or 406.3% YoY on an FX neutral basis. The increase resulted mainly from higher net interest income from the consumer finance portfolio, composed of personal loans and credit cards. Also contributing to this increase was the rise in Brazil&rsquo;s interest rates during 4Q'21 (the interbank deposit rate in Brazil (CDI) averaged 7.6% p.a. in 4Q&rsquo;21 compared to 1.9% p.a. in 4Q&rsquo;20) coupled with an increase in financial assets, mainly arising from Nu&rsquo;s growing retail deposit base in Brazil. In 2021, Interest Income and Gains (Losses) on Financial Instruments was $1.0 billion , up 173.4% YoY, or 182.4% YoY on an FX neutral basis. In Q4&acute;21, Fee and Commission Income was $196.4 million , up 74.0% YoY , or 79.7% YoY on an FX neutral basis. This was mainly due to the increase in interchange fees, reflecting higher credit and debit card purchase volumes driven by growth in the number of customers and their activity rates. These increases were partially offset by a non-recurring $11.2 million reduction in revenues resulting from the Customer Program (NuS&oacute;cios), which represents the fair value of BDRs allocated to the 7.5 million customers who enrolled in the program as part of the Company's IPO. In 2021, Fee and Commission Income was $651.3 million , up 83.9% YoY, or 90.0% YoY on a FX neutral basis. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided In Q4'21, Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided was $409.0 million , up 224.1% YoY, or 234.7% YoY on an FX neutral basis. This cost represented 64.3% of revenue in the Q4&rsquo;21, compared to 62.3% in Q4`20. In 2021, the Cost of Financial and Transactional Services amounted to $965.1 million , up 135.3% YoY, or 143.1% YoY on an FX neutral basis, accounting for 56.8% of revenue in the year, compared to 55.7% in 2020. Cost of Financial and Transactional Services Provided ($ Million) Q4'21 Q4'20 FY'21 FY'20 Interest and other financial expenses (177.0) (31.4) (367.4) (113.9) Transactional expenses (32.4) (39.1) (117.1) (126.8) Credit loss allowance expenses (199.6) (55.7) (480.6) (169.5) Total (409.0) (126.2) (965.1) (410.2) % of Revenue 64.3% 62.3% 56.8% 55.7% FX Neutral &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest and other financial expenses (177.0) (30.4) (367.4) (110.2) Transactional expenses (32.4) (37.9) (117.1) (122.7) Credit loss allowance expenses (199.6) (53.9) (480.6) (164.0) Total (409.0) (122.2) (965.1) (397.0) % of Revenue 64.3% 62.3% 56.8% 55.7% &nbsp; The increase in Interest and Other Financial Expenses was principally driven by growth in interest expenses on retail deposits that resulted from the aforementioned increase in Brazil&rsquo;s interest rates coupled with the expansion of Nu&rsquo;s retail deposit balance. The increase in credit loss allowance expenses resulted from the rapid growth of Nu's interest-earning portfolio and related ECL credit provisioning. &nbsp; During 2921, the evolution of Nu&rsquo;s transactional expenses continued to benefit from cost reductions related to the growing adoption of PIX in Brazil, which is an instant payment platform that replaces more expensive bank slip payment processing methods, as well as from lower unit costs that stemmed from renegotiations with the Company&rsquo;s key suppliers. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross Profit In Q4'21, Gross Profit totaled $226.9 million , increasing 197.4% YoY, or 207.0% YoY on an FX neutral basis. The gross profit margin was 35.7% compared to 37.7% in Q4&rsquo;20, reflecting the impact of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) under IFRS, where loan loss provisions are recognized upfront at the time a loan is granted and before it has generated any revenue. In 2021, gross profit was $732.9 million , up 124.2% YoY , or 131.6% on an FX neutral basis compared to $326.9 million in 2020, while the gross profit margin was 43.2% compared to 44.3% in 2020. OPERATING EXPENSE In Q4&acute;21, Operating Expenses totaled $315.4 million , up 208.9% YoY , or 218.9% YoY on an FX neutral basis, but declined to 49.6% of total revenues from 50.4% in 4Q20. The main driver behind the absolute increase in operating expenses was general and administrative expenses, which grew 174.8% YoY , or 183.8% YoY on an FX neutral basis, mainly reflecting an increase in share-based compensation stemming from the effect of taxes arising from the share price appreciation in 2021 as a result of Nu&rsquo;s IPO, as well as the increase in headcount during the period. In addition, customer support and operations expenses increased 130.9% YoY , or 138.4% YoY on an FX neutral basis, to serve a significantly higher increase in the number of customers while investing in services to further enhance the overall user experience. In 2021, operating expenses reached $903.1 million , up 115.6% YoY , or 122.8% YoY on an FX neutral basis, while declining to 53.2% of total revenue from 56.8% in 2020. In addition to the aforementioned factors, one-time marketing expenses associated with Nu&acute;s IPO contributed to the increase in operating expenses.

In addition to IFRS financials, this presentation includes certain summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial information. These summarized, non-audited or non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. References in this presentation to &ldquo;R$&rdquo; refer to the Brazilian real, the official currency of Brazil. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This release includes financial measures defined as &ldquo;non-IFRS financial measures&rdquo; by the SEC, including: Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and certain FX Neutral measures and provides reconciliations to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure. A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance or financial position that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure.&nbsp;These non-IFRS financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company for the year/period, adjusted for expenses and allocated tax effects on share-based compensation in such year/period, finance costs related to results with convertible instruments in such year/period, as well as expenses (revenue deduction) and allocated tax effects related to the IPO-related customer program (NuS&oacute;cios) in such year/period.&nbsp; Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is presented because our management believes that this non-IFRS financial measure can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of our operating and financial performance, although it is not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. We also use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as a key profitability measure to assess the performance of our business. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is useful to evaluate our operating and financial performance for the following reasons: &#9679; Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company&rsquo;s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period, depending on their accounting and tax methods, the book value and the market value of their assets and liabilities, and the method by which their assets were acquired; &#9679; Non-cash equity grants made to executives, employees or consultants at a certain price and point in time, and their income tax effects, do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and the related expenses (and their subject impacts in the market value of our assets and liabilities) are not key measures of our core operating performance; &#9679; Expenses related to the Customer Program (NuS&oacute;cios), and their income tax effects, do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and it represents a specific marketing effort event from our IPO and are not key measures of our core operating performance; and &#9679; Finance costs with convertible instruments include fair value adjustments relating to the embedded derivative conversion feature, which are based upon subjective assumptions and do not reflect the cash cost of our convertible debt, and do not directly reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and the related expense adjustment amounts are not key measures of our core operating performance. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a substitute for Net Income, which is the IFRS measure of earnings. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) may be different from the calculation used by other companies, including our competitors in the technology and financial services industries, because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner as we do, and therefore, our measure may not be comparable to those of other companies. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adjusted Net Income reconciliation For the years and the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (In thousands of U.S. Dollars) &nbsp; Q4'21 Q4'20 2021 2020 Profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent company (66.1) (107.1) (165.0) (171.5) Share-based compensation 90.1 26.6 225.4 56.3 Allocated tax effects on share-based compensation (27.0) (4.9) (60.0) (12.8) Customer Program (NuS&oacute;cios) 11.2 - 11.2 - Allocated tax effects on Customer Program (5.0) - (5.0) - Finance costs - results with convertible instruments - 101.2 - 101.2 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period 3.2 15.8 6.6 (26.8) &nbsp; FX Neutral measures are prepared and presented to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange, or &ldquo;FX,&rdquo; volatility between the comparison periods, allowing management and investors to evaluate our financial performance despite variations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. FX Neutral measures are presented because our management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures can provide useful information to investors, securities analysts and the public in their review of our operating and financial performance, although they are not calculated in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as a measure of performance in isolation. The FX Neutral measures were calculated to present what such measures in preceding periods/years would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these preceding periods/years until the date of the Company's most recent financial information. The FX Neutral measures for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and the key business metrics for such period by the average Brazilian reais /U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2020 (R$5.434 to US$1.00) and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2021 (R$5.612 to US$1.00), so as to present what certain of our statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained stable from this past period until the three months ended December 31, 2021. The FX Neutral measures for the year ended December 31, 2020 were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and the key business metrics for such periods/years by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2020 (R$5.240 to US$1.00), and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by the average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 (R$5.415 to US$1.00), so as to present what certain of our statement of profit and loss amounts and key business metrics would have been had exchange rates remained stable from these past periods/years until the year ended December 31, 2021. The average Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated as the average of the month-end rates for each month in the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the average of the month-end rates for each month in the years 2021 and 2020 as reported by Bloomberg. FX Neutral measures for deposits and interest-earning portfolio were calculated by multiplying the as reported amounts as of December 31, 2020, by the spot Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates as of this date (R$5.199 to US$1.00), and using such results to re-translate the corresponding amounts back to U.S. dollars by dividing them by using the spot rate as of December 31, 2021 (R$5.576 to US$1.00) so as to present what these amounts would have been had exchange rates been the same as those on December 31, 2021. The Brazilian reais/U.S. dollars exchange rates were calculated using rates as of such dates as reported by Bloomberg. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth Quarter 2021 Results &nbsp; 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
