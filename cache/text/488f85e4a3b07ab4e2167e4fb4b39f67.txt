About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful 3 supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. • Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. • Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with reductions in our workforce and office space during 2023 were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments. Other Income (Expense), Net The following table presents our other income (expense), net (in millions; unaudited): Quarter Ended December 31, 2022 2023 Interest income $ 659 $ 1,110 Interest expense (90) (69) Foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net (185) (449) Gain (loss) on debt securities, net (176) (115) Gain (loss) on equity securities, net(1) (1,487) 586 Performance fees 193 (45) Income (loss) and impairment from equity method investments, net (31) (256) Other 104 (47) Other income (expense), net $ (1,013) $ 715 (1) Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities.

Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods. Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (in millions; unaudited): We provide non-GAAP free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet. Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,915 Less: purchases of property and equipment (11,019) Free cash flow $ 7,896 Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. 9 Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues (in millions, except percentages; unaudited): We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results. Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
