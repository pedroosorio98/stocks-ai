Cayman Islands &nbsp; Introduction We have reviewed the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial position of Nu Holdings Ltd. (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as at June 30, 2022, the condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income or loss for the three and six-month periods then ended, changes in equity and cash flows for six-month period then ended, and notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interim Financial Reporting&rsquo; issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this condensed consolidated interim financial information based on our review. &nbsp; Scope of reveiw We conducted our review in accordance with Brazilian and International Standards on Review (NBC TR 2410 - Revis&atilde;o de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Intermedi&aacute;rias Executada pelo Auditor da Entidade and ISRE 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity , respectively). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at June 30, 2022 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34, &lsquo;Interin Financial Reporting&rsquo;. &nbsp; &nbsp; S&atilde;o Paulo, August 15, 2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; KPMG Auditores Independentes Ltda.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, unless otherwise stated) &nbsp; 1. Operations Nu Holdings Ltd. (&quot;Company&quot; or &quot;Nu Holdings&quot;) was incorporated as an exempted Company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on February 26, 2016. The address of the Company's registered office is Willow House, 4 th floor, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman - Cayman Islands. Nu Holdings has no operating activities. The Company&#8217;s shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;) under the symbol &#8220;NU&#8221; and its Brazilian Depositary Receipts (&quot;BDRs&quot;) are traded on B3 - Brasil, Bolsa, Balc&atilde;o (&quot;B3&quot;), the Brazilian stock exchange, under the symbol &quot;NUBR33&quot;. The Company holds investments in several operating entities and, as of June 30, 2022, its significant operating subsidiaries were: &#9679; Nu Pagamentos S.A. - Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamento (&#8220;Nu Pagamentos&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Brazil. Nu Pagamentos is engaged in the issuance and administration of credit cards and payment transfers through a prepaid account, and participation in other companies as partner or shareholder. Nu Pagamentos has as its primary products (i) a Mastercard international credit card (issued in Brazil where it allows payments for purchases to be made in monthly installments), fully managed through a smartphone app, and (ii) NuConta, a 100% digital smartphone app, maintenance-free prepaid account, which also includes features of a traditional bank account such as: electronic and peer-to-peer transfers, bill payments, withdrawals through the 24 Hours ATM network, instant payments, prepaid credit for mobile top ups and prepaid cards similar in functionality to debit cards. &#9679; Nu Financeira S.A. &#8211; SCFI (&#8220;Nu Financeira&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary also domiciled in Brazil, with personal loans and retail deposits as its main products. Nu Financeira offers customers in Brazil the possibility to obtain loans that can be customized in relation to amounts, terms and conditions, number of installments, and transparent disclosure of any charges involved in the transaction, fully managed through the above-mentioned smartphone app. Loan issuance, repayment, and prepayments are available 24/7 through NuConta's account, directly in the app. Nu Financeira also grants credit to Nu Pagamentos credit card holders, due to overdue invoices, bill installments and revolving credit, and retail deposits on-demand or with specific maturity for redemption of balances and remuneration rates equal or higher than NuConta. &#9679; Nu BN Servicios M&eacute;xico, S.A. de CV (&#8220;Nu Servicios&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Mexico. Nu Servicios is engaged in the issuance and administration of credit cards. It commenced operations in the Mexican market in August 2019 and officially launched in March 2020. The credit card has similar characteristics to that of the Brazilian operation: an international credit card, with no annual fee, under the Mastercard banner, 100% managed by a digital app on a smartphone. &#9679; Nu Colombia S.A. (&#8220;Nu Colombia&#8221;) is an indirect subsidiary domiciled in Colombia, with operations related to credit cards, which was launched in September 2020. &#9679; Nu Invest Corretora de Valores S.A. (&quot;Nu Invest&quot;) is an indirect subsidiary acquired in June 2021, domiciled in Brazil, and is a digital investment broker dealer. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements as the &#8220;Group&#8221; or &quot;Nu&#8221;. The business plan of Nu provides for the continued growth of its Brazilian, Mexican, and Colombian operations, not only related to existing businesses, such as credit cards, personal loans, investments, and insurance, but also complemented by the launch of new products. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the assumption of the Group continuing as a going concern, considering that recent losses are principally due to the expenses incurred to deliver upon the Group&#8217;s rapid growth, in accordance with its business plan. The Company&#8217;s Board authorized the issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements on August 12, 2022. a) Acquisition activities completed during the period i) Olivia On November 2, 2021, Nu Holdings signed a stock purchase agreement (&quot;SPA&quot;) to purchase all the shares of Olivia AI do Brasil Participa&ccedil;&otilde;es Ltda. (&quot;Olivia Participa&ccedil;&otilde;es&quot;), Olivia AI do Brasil Institui&ccedil;&atilde;o de Pagamento Ltda. (&quot;Olivia Pagamentos&quot;) and Olivia AI Inc. (&quot;Olivia Inc&quot;) - together referred to as &quot;Olivia&quot; in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Olivia's acquisition was completed on January 3, 2022, when the control over the entities was transferred to Nu upon the completion of all conditions established in the SPA and the liquidation of the first part of the acquisition's contractual price. In 2016, Olivia launched an artificial intelligence (&quot;AI&quot;) solution that helps individuals manage their money. The AI works by integrating the user's various bank accounts and applying data analysis of both the expenses and income of its users, in order to provide suggestions for financial planning. Nu believes that Olivia's AI will further strengthen the Group's open banking initiatives. In addition, Olivia's strategic capabilities in data science and its highly specialized team will enable Nu to continue creating and offering new products based on artificial intelligence. The transaction qualified as a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Purchase consideration at acquisition date The total purchase price was US$47,225, of which US$10,554 settled on the acquisition date in cash and the remainder is to be settled upon issuance of 3,909,449 shares on the first anniversary of the acquisition date. In connection with Olivia's acquisition, Nu Holdings expects to issue an aggregate of up to 3,970,986 class A ordinary shares as consideration for post-combination services rendered to Nu by the former shareholders and employees who became part of the Group following the closing, which were then considered as compensation and not a component of the purchase consideration transferred. Net identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed The control over the entities was transferred to Nu in January 2022. The Company has concluded the identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the allocation of the purchase price to these assets and liabilities, with the exception of the measurement of the fair value of the intangible assets and, therefore, the measurement of goodwill. The purchase price allocation, including the preliminary allocation to the intangible assets and goodwill is shown below. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; Identifiable intangible assets will be amortized over a period of 3 to 6 years, according to their useful life, defined based on the expected future economic benefits generated by the asset. The goodwill does not have a defined useful life and will have its recoverability tested at least annually. The goodwill from Olivia&#8217;s acquisition relates to future benefits expected to be realized through different strategies, such as the usage of the technology and Olivia's professional technical team within the ecosystem of Nu's solutions. &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair value recognized on acquisition - US$ Identifiable assets and liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp; 208 Other assets &nbsp; 615 Intangible assets &nbsp; 42,421 Liabilities &nbsp; (6,400) Total identifiable net assets at fair value &nbsp; 36,844 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Goodwill arising on acquisition &nbsp; 10,381 Purchase consideration transferred &nbsp; 47,225 Equity consideration &nbsp; 36,671 Cash consideration &nbsp; 10,554 The additional intangible assets recognized, and the allocation of the purchase price were customer relationship (US$3,670) and intellectual property (US$38,751), at the acquisition date. The following were the main assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: (i) discount rate of 15.9% and (ii) the residual value was calculated based on projected cash flows. Net cash outflow on acquisition &nbsp; &nbsp; US$ Consideration paid in cash &nbsp; 10,554 (-) Cash and cash equivalent balances acquired &nbsp; (208) Net cash outflow &nbsp; 10,346 &nbsp; Impact of the acquisition on the results of the Group Olivia contributed US$568 in revenues and a US$14,801 loss for the six-month period between the date of acquisition and the reporting date. As Olivia was acquired on January 3, 2022, no other impact on revenue or loss would occur in these interim condensed financial statements. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14 Nu Holdings Ltd.

Statement of compliance These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&quot;IFRS&#8221;) as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (&#8220;IASB&#8221;). However, selected condensed notes were included to explain events and transactions that are significant to understanding the changes in the Company&#8217;s financial position and performance since the issuance of its last annual financial statements. The Group&#8217;s interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting issued by IASB. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the &quot;Annual Financial Statements&#8221;). a) Functional currency and foreign currency translation The presentation of the functional currency and foreign currency translation disclosed in note 2a of the annual financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2021, remain valid for these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The functional currency for Nu Holdings and the presentation currency of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements is the US Dollar (&#8220;US$&#8221;). The functional currency of the Brazilian operating entities is the Brazilian real, for the Mexican entities, Mexican peso and for the Colombian entity, the Colombian peso. The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries held in functional currencies that are not US$ are translated into US$, and the exchange differences arising from the translation to US$ of the financial statements denominated in functional currencies other than the US$ are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income or loss (OCI) as an item that may be reclassified to profit or loss within &#8220;currency translation on foreign entities&#8221;. b) New or revised accounting pronouncements adopted in 2022 The following new or revised standards have been issued by IASB, were effective for, but had no impact on, the period covered by these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &#9679; Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; &#9679; Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018&#8211;2020 (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 16) c) Other new standards and interpretations not yet effective &#9679; Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2) &#9679; Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8) &#9679; Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) Management does not expect the adoption of the standards and interpretations described above to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 3. Basis of consolidation These interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounting balances of Nu Holdings and all those subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, directly or indirectly. Control is achieved where the Company has (i) power over the investee; (ii) is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) can use its power to affect its profits. The Company re-assesses whether it maintains control of an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three above mentioned elements of control. The consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over it and ceases when the Company loses control over it. Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the reporting period are included in the interim condensed consolidated statements of profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, Nu deconsolidated Nu Fundo de Investimentos em A&ccedil;&otilde;es (&#8220;Nu FIA&#8221;) due to the loss of its control. The financial information of the subsidiaries was prepared in the same period as the Company and consistent accounting policies were applied. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Company. Accordingly, all balances, transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising between consolidated entities are eliminated in the consolidation, except for foreign-currency gain and losses on translation of intercompany loans. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income or loss are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, when applicable. These interim condensed consolidated financial statements include, among other entities, the operational subsidiaries listed below: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16 Nu Holdings Ltd.

(&quot;Nu Financiera&quot;), a Mexican subsidiary, is regulated by both the Mexican Central Bank (&quot;BANXICO&quot;) and Mexican National Baking and Stock Commission (&#8220;CNBV&#8221;), and as such, there are some regulatory requirements that restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer assets freely to or from these entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. 4. Significant accounting policies The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the financial statements and each corresponding note for the year ended December 31, 2021. 5. Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires judgments, estimates, and assumptions from management that affect the application of accounting policies, and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates; and estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to the estimates are recognized prospectively. The significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of these interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six-month periods ended on June 30, 2022 were the same as those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, except for the change of the write-off period applied based on the estimate of recovery for the lending portfolio, as explained in note 14. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; a) Credit losses on financial instruments The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on credit cards and loans receivables that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of allowance as of each reporting date. Management performs an analysis of the credit card and loan amounts to determine if credit losses have occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses. Key areas of judgment The critical judgments made by management in applying the expected credit losses (ECL) allowance methodology are: a) Definition of default; b) Forward-looking information used to the projection of macroeconomic scenarios; c) Probability weights of future scenarios; d) Definition of significant increase in credit risk and lifetime; and e) Look-back period, used for parameters estimation (probability of default - PD, exposure at default - EAD and loss given default - LGD). Sensitivity analysis On June 30, 2022, the probability weighted ECL allowance totaled US$967,624 of which US$697,347 related to credit card operations and US$270,277 to loans. The ECL allowance is sensitive to the methodology, assumptions and estimations underlying its calculation. One key assumption is the probability weighting of the macroeconomic scenarios. The table below illustrates the ECL that would have arisen if management had applied a 100% weighting to each macroeconomic scenario. &nbsp; &nbsp; Upside &nbsp; Base case &nbsp; Downside &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Credit card and lending ECL &nbsp; 952,212 &nbsp; 967,490 &nbsp; 983,654 The table below discloses the forecast used in each scenario for the Brazilian ECL allowance: &nbsp; &nbsp; Upside &nbsp; Base case &nbsp; Downside &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2022- Brazilian GDP growth &nbsp; 2.0% &nbsp; 0.8% &nbsp; -0.4% b) Recovery estimate - lending portfolio During the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, the Group updated its recovery estimate for the loan portfolio, as described in note 14. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18 Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; The Company has instruments that will become ordinary shares upon the exercise, vesting, conversion, or upon the satisfaction of specific conditions related to business combinations. These instruments were considered antidilutive because they would decrease the loss per share. These antidilutive instruments were not included in the weighted number of shares for the diluted earnings per share and they comprise SOPs, RSUs, and Awards described in note 10 and preferred and contingent shares described in note 27. The number of shares for all periods presented were adjusted to reflect the 6-for-1 forward share split approved on August 30, 2021 (note 27). 10. Share-based payments The Group&#8217;s employee incentives include share settled awards in the form of stock, offering them the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares by exercising options (Stock Options &#8211; &#8220;SOPs&#8221;), receiving ordinary shares (Restricted Stock Units &#8211; &#8220;RSUs&#8221;) upon vesting, and receiving shares upon the achievement of market conditions and passage of time (&quot;Awards&quot;). The cost of the employee services received with respect to the SOPs and RSUs granted is recognized in the statement of profit or loss over the period that the employee provides services and according to the vesting conditions. The Group has also issued Awards in 2020 and 2021 that grant shares upon the achievement of market conditions related to the valuation of the Company, and also the passage of time for the Awards issued in 2021. RSUs incentive was implemented in 2020 and is the main incentive since then. There were no changes to the terms and conditions of the SOPs, RSUs and Awards after the grant date. The changes in the number of SOPs and RSUs are as follows. WAEP is the weighted average exercise price and WAGDFV is the weighted average fair value at the grant date. &nbsp; SOPs 06/30/2022 &nbsp; WAEP (US$) &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; WAEP (US$) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding on January 1 143,889,439 &nbsp; 0.50 &nbsp; 42,515,821 &nbsp; 1.58 Granted during the period - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,141,362 &nbsp; 23.75 Exercised during the period (31,617,827) &nbsp; 0.10 &nbsp; (18,822,551) &nbsp; 0.38 Forfeited during the period (4,505,483) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (853,059) &nbsp; &nbsp; Balances before 6-for-1 forward share split 107,766,129 &nbsp; 0.69 &nbsp; 23,981,573 &nbsp; 3.01 Issuance of options due to 6-for-1 forward split - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 119,907,866 &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding on June 30 / December 31 107,766,129 &nbsp; 0.69 &nbsp; 143,889,439 &nbsp; 0.50 Exercisable on June 30 / December 31 79,186,733 &nbsp; 0.48 &nbsp; 101,416,310 &nbsp; 0.20 &nbsp; &nbsp; RSUs 06/30/2022 &nbsp; WAGDFV (US$) &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; WAGDFV (US$) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding on January 1 80,924,937 &nbsp; 4.82 &nbsp; 5,294,454 &nbsp; 10.47 Granted during the period 20,608,194 &nbsp; 6.03 &nbsp; 13,103,243 &nbsp; 36.65 Vested during the period (10,486,188) &nbsp; 3.41 &nbsp; (3,092,289) &nbsp; 15.06 Forfeited during the period (5,472,887) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1,817,919) &nbsp; &nbsp; Balances before 6-for-1 forward share split 85,574,056 &nbsp; 5.29 &nbsp; 13,487,489 &nbsp; 28.91 Issuance of options due to 6-for-1 forward split - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 67,437,448 &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding on June 30 / December 31 85,574,056 &nbsp; 5,29 &nbsp; 80,924,937 &nbsp; 4.82 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 23 Nu Holdings Ltd.

With this product, the cardholder's purchase is paid in up to 12 equal monthly installments. The cardholder&#8217;s credit limit is initially reduced by the total amount and the installments become due and payable on the cardholder&#8217;s subsequent monthly credit card statements. The Group makes the corresponding payments to the credit card network (see note 20) following a similar schedule. As receipts and payments are aligned, the Group does not incur significant financing costs with this product, however it is exposed to the credit risk of the cardholder as it is obliged to make the payments to the credit card network even if the cardholder does not pay. &#8220;Receivables &#8211; installments&#8221; also includes the amounts of credit card bills not fully paid by the customers and that have been converted into payments in installments with a fixed interest rate (&#8220;fatura parcelada&#8221;). (ii) &quot;Receivables - revolving&quot; is related to the amounts due from customers that have not paid in full their credit card bill. Customers may request to convert these receivables into loans to be paid in installments. In accordance with Brazilian regulation, revolving balances that are outstanding for more than 2 months are mandatorily converted into &#8220;fatura parcelada&#8221; - a type of installment loan which is settled through the customer&#8217;s monthly credit card bills . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27 Nu Holdings Ltd.

The provision is provided by a model estimation, consistently applied, which is sensitive to the methods, assumptions, and risk parameters underlying its calculation. The amount that the credit loss allowance represents in comparison to the Group&#8217;s gross receivables coverage ratio is also monitored, to anticipate trends that could indicate credit risk increases. This metric is considered a key risk indicator. It is monitored across multiple committees, supporting the decision-making process and is discussed in the primary credit forums along with the Group. All receivables are classified through stages, where: (i) stage 1 include all receivables not classified in stages 2 and 3; (ii) stage 2 is primarily related to all receivables more than 30 (thirty), but less than 90 (ninety), days in arrears, or with an increase in client's behavior risk score compared to the time of the origination; and (iii) stage 3 when receivables are more than 90 (ninety) days in arrears, or there are indications that the financial asset will not be fully paid without a collateral or financial guarantee. The majority of the Group's credit card portfolio was classified as stage 1, followed by stages 2 and 3, respectively as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. The proportion of stage 3 exposures increased to 5.0% on June 30, 2022 from 3.8% on December 31, 2021, as delinquency flows through the stages following the seasonal increases in stage 2 observed in the first quarter. The stage 3 movement is also due to the gradual risk normalization of the growing portfolio, as it moves towards the pre-COVID-19 risk profile (see item (f) about COVID-19 impacts). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28 Nu Holdings Ltd.

This movement is explained by aforementioned risk normalization following the initial impacts of COVID-19. There is still a significant concentration of receivables at stage 1 based on credit quality. Receivables with satisfactory risk are distributed between stages 1 and 2, mostly at stage 1. Defaulted assets at stage 3 are classified as higher risk, which also accounts for a large proportion of stage 2 exposure. Stage 1 receivables classified as higher risk are those customers with low credit risk scores. e) Credit loss allowance - changes The following tables show the reconciliations from the opening to the closing balance of the credit loss allowance by stages of the financial instruments. &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Stage 1 &nbsp; Stage 2 &nbsp; Stage 3 &nbsp; Total Loss allowance at beginning of period &nbsp; 127,358 &nbsp; 126,392 &nbsp; 136,929 &nbsp; 390,679 Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 &nbsp; (18,388) &nbsp; 18,388 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - Transfers from Stage 2 to Stage 1 &nbsp; 25,161 &nbsp; (25,161) &nbsp; - &nbsp; - Transfers to Stage 3 &nbsp; (11,112) &nbsp; (68,384) &nbsp; 79,496 &nbsp; - Transfers from Stage 3 &nbsp; 1,069 &nbsp; 569 &nbsp; (1,638) &nbsp; - Write-offs &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; (100,089) &nbsp; (100,089) Net increase of loss allowance &nbsp; 82,709 &nbsp; 166,535 &nbsp; 143,436 &nbsp; 392,680 New originations (a) &nbsp; 72,306 &nbsp; 5,156 &nbsp; 1,571 &nbsp; 79,033 Changes in exposure of preexisting accounts (b) &nbsp; 84,647 &nbsp; 2,025 &nbsp; 137 &nbsp; 86,809 Net drawdowns, repayments, net remeasurement and movements due to risk changes &nbsp; (74,244) &nbsp; 159,354 &nbsp; 141,728 &nbsp; 226,838 Changes to models used in calculation (c) &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; - Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; 4,936 &nbsp; 4,737 &nbsp; 4,404 &nbsp; 14,077 Loss allowance at end of the period &nbsp; 211,733 &nbsp; 223,076 &nbsp; 262,538 &nbsp; 697,347 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30 Nu Holdings Ltd.

In addition, the Brazilian government response included &quot;Emergency Aid&quot;, all of which together caused a change in the portfolio credit behavior, reducing delinquency and other risk indicators. As vaccination advanced and restrictions fell, mainly after the last quarter of 2021, the economy started to regain traction, laying ground for a resumption in risk-related activities. In 2022, as the effects of the pandemic dimmed, the risk profile of the portfolio changed, moving in the direction of pre-COVID-19 levels, which is considered a risk normalization trend. Although early delinquencies have already normalized to pre-COVID-19 levels, later delinquencies are still on an expected lagged path of normalization. 14.

Therefore, to prevent the build-up of the gross loans, Nu applied an immediate partial write-off for loans for the amounts for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, as allowed under IFRS 9, with a portion of the loan being written off immediately. Following the partial write-off, the remaining balance is recognized in gross loans until the point at which there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. There is no effect in the statement of profit or loss due to the change in estimate, and the effect in the gross exposure and loss allowance balances for loans to customers are shown in item d) Credit loss allowance - changes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 32 Nu Holdings Ltd.

Derivative financial instruments The Group executes transactions with derivative financial instruments, which are intended to meet its own needs to reduce its exposure to market, currency and interest-rate risks. The derivatives are classified as at fair value through profit or loss, except those in cash flow hedge accounting strategies, for which the effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives is recognized directly in other comprehensive income (loss). The management of these risks is conducted through determining limits, and the establishment of operating strategies. The derivative contracts are considered level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy and are used to hedge exposures, but hedge accounting is adopted only for forecast transactions related to the cloud infrastructure and certain software licenses used by Nu (hedge of foreign currency risk), to reduce fair value fluctuations of fixed rate credit portfolio (hedge of interest rate risk of portfolio) and to cover the future cash disbursement related to highly probable future transactions and accrued liabilities for corporate taxes and social wages at RSU vesting or SOP exercise, as shown below. &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair values &nbsp; &nbsp; Notional amount &nbsp; Assets &nbsp; Liabilities Derivatives classified as fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interest rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 5,425,950 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; (795) Exchange rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 113,136 &nbsp; 629 &nbsp; (35) Interest rate contracts - Swap &nbsp; 10,101 &nbsp; 108 &nbsp; - Currency - Non-deliverable forward contract (NDF) &nbsp; 85,284 &nbsp; 88,104 &nbsp; (85,283) Warrants (i) &nbsp; 100,000 &nbsp; 33,823 &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivatives held for hedging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Designated as cash flow hedges &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exchange rate contracts - Future &nbsp; 95,554 &nbsp; 377 &nbsp; - Equity - Total Return Swap (TRS) &nbsp; 89,726 &nbsp; (13,109) &nbsp; (398) Total shown as derivatives &nbsp; 5,919,751 &nbsp; 109,934 &nbsp; (86,511) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Designated as portfolio hedges &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DI - Future (Credit derivative contracts) - notes 13 and 14 &nbsp; 2,078,160 &nbsp; (6,670) &nbsp; - Total &nbsp; 7,997,911 &nbsp; 103,264 &nbsp; (86,511) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 37 Nu Holdings Ltd.

(and/or its affiliates in Latin America, or together, &#8220;Creditas&#8221;) through which Nu will distribute certain financial products offered by Creditas to its customers in Latin America. These include affordable retail collateralized loans, such as home and auto equity loans, auto financing, motorcycle financing and payroll loans. The agreement also provided that Nu would invest up to US$200,000 in Creditas&#8217; securitization vehicles, becoming the holder of the senior quotas of the fund. Nu was granted warrants that provide the right to acquire an equity interest equivalent to up to 7.7% of Creditas, on a fully diluted basis, under a pre-agreed valuation, proportional to fifty percent of the amount invested in the securitization vehicles and products distributed. During 2022, the total amount agreed of US$200,000 was invested in the securitization vehicles, shown as part of the &#8220;investment funds&#8221; on note 12, and, consequently, US$100,000 was shown as notional in the table above. Nu can exercise the option at any time, but the expiration date is 2 years after the issuance date. As of June 30, 2022, the warrants' fair value was US$33,823, calculated using a Black Scholes model, classified as level 3 on the fair value hierarchy, as shown in note 25. The Company recognized a gain of US$14,067 during 2022. Other derivative financial instruments Futures contracts are traded on the B3, which is also the counterparty. Swap contracts are settled daily and are traded over the counter with financial institutions as counterparties. The total value of margins pledged by the Group in transactions on the stock exchange is disclosed in note 12. Nu Holdings entered into non-deliverable forward contracts to economically hedge the foreign exchange exposures on intercompany loans with subsidiaries.

The Group managed its exposures to the variability in cash flows of foreign currency forecast transactions to movements in foreign exchange rates by entering foreign exchange contracts (exchange futures). These instruments are entered into to match the cash flow profile of the estimated forecast transaction and are exchange-traded and settled on a daily basis. The Group applies hedge accounting to the forecast transactions related to its main cloud infrastructure contract and other expenses in foreign currency. The effectiveness is assessed monthly by analyzing the critical terms. The critical terms of the hedging instrument and the amount of the forecasted hedged transactions are significantly the same. Derivatives are generally rolled over monthly. They are expected to &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; occur in the same fiscal month as the maturity date of the hedging instrument. Therefore, the hedge is expected to be effective. Subsequent assessments of effectiveness are performed by verifying and documenting whether the critical terms of the hedging instrument and forecasted hedged transaction have changed during the period in review and whether it remains probable. If there are no such changes in critical terms, the Group will continue to conclude that the hedging relationship is effective. Sources of ineffectiveness are differences in the amount and timing of forecast and actual payment of expenses. &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period / year &nbsp; 1,487 &nbsp; 49 Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; (12,737) &nbsp; 2,705 Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to income statement during the period &nbsp; 4,585 &nbsp; (242) to &quot;Customer support and operation&quot; &nbsp; 2,287 &nbsp; (91) to &quot;General and administrative expenses&quot; &nbsp; 2,470 &nbsp; (136) Effect of changes in exchange rates (OCI) &nbsp; (172) &nbsp; (15) Deferred income taxes &nbsp; 3,268 &nbsp; (1,025) Balance at end of the period / year &nbsp; (3,397) &nbsp; 1,487 The material future transactions that are the object of the hedge are: &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; Up to 3 months &nbsp; 3 to 12 months &nbsp; Total &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expected foreign currency transactions &nbsp; 25,088 &nbsp; 70,332 &nbsp; 95,420 &nbsp; 78,401 Total &nbsp; 25,088 &nbsp; 70,332 &nbsp; 95,420 &nbsp; 78,401 b) Hedge of portfolio's interest rate risk The Group holds portfolios of customers&#8217; lending and refinancing of credit cards receivables at fixed interest rates, which creates market risk due to changes of the Brazilian interbank deposits&#8217; (CDI) benchmark rate. Thus, to protect the fixed rate risk from CDI variation, the Group entered into future DI contracts to offset the market risk, and applied hedge accounting aiming to eliminate differences between the accounting measurement of its derivatives and hedged items which are adjusted to reflect changes in CDI. The Group&#8217;s overall hedging strategy remains to reduce fair value changes of the part of the fixed rate portfolio as if they were floating rate instruments linked to the attributable benchmark rates. As such, in order to reflect the dynamic nature of the hedged portfolio, the strategy is to rebalance the future DI contracts and evaluate the allocated amount by the credit portfolio. Additionally, ineffectiveness could arise from the disparity between expected and actual prepayments (prepayment risk). In accordance with its hedging strategy, the Group calculates the DV01 (delta value of a basis point ) of the exposure and futures to identify the optimal hedging ratio, and monitors in a timely manner the hedge relationship, providing any rebalancing if needed. The need for the purchase or sale of new future DI contracts will be assessed, to counterbalance the hedged item&#8217;s market value adjustment, aiming to assure hedge effectiveness between 80% and 125%, as determined on hedge documentation. The effectiveness test for the hedge is done in a prospective and retrospective way. In the prospective test, the Group compares the impact of a 1 basis point parallel shift on the interest rate curve (DV01) on the hedged object and on the hedge instrument market value. For the retrospective test, the market-to-market &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 41 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; value change since the inception of the hedged object is compared to the hedge instrument. In both cases, the hedge is considered effective if the correlation is between 80% and 125%. &nbsp; For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in &quot;Interest income and gains (losses) on financial instruments - financial assets at fair value&quot;. In addition, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The derivative financial instruments used to cover the exposure are total return swaps (&quot;TRS&quot;) in which one leg is indexed to the Company's stock price and the other leg is indexed to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&quot;SOFR&quot;) plus spread. The stock fixed at the TRS is a weighted average price. The hedge was entered into by Nu Holdings and therefore there is no income tax effect. The Group applies the cash flow hedge for the hedge structure hence the market risk is replaced by an interest rate risk. The effectiveness assessment is performed monthly by (i) assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; (ii) monitoring the credit risk impact in the hedge effectiveness; and (iii) maintaining and updating the hedging ratio. Given the possibility of forfeiture impacting the future cash forecast of the employee benefit plan, the Group under hedges the exposure to keep the hedging level within an acceptable coverage. The derivative fair value is measured substantially based on the stock price which is also used on the measurement of the provision or payment for corporate taxes and social wages, therefore there is no expectation for a mismatch to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument at maturity other than the SOFR. &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance at beginning of the period &nbsp; - Fair value change recognized in OCI during the period &nbsp; (13,507) Total amount reclassified from cash flow hedge reserve to income statement during the period (i) &nbsp; 1,290 Balance at end of the period &nbsp; (12,217) &nbsp; (i) Presented as share-based compensation on general and administrative expenses. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 42 Nu Holdings Ltd.

Related parties In the ordinary course of business, the Group may have issued credit cards or loans to Nu&#8217;s executive directors, board members, key employees and close family members. Those transactions, as well as the deposits and other products, as investments, occur on similar terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions to unrelated persons and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. As described in note 3, &quot;Basis of consolidation&quot;, all companies from the Group are consolidated in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, related party balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from inter-company transactions, are eliminated in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 48 Nu Holdings Ltd.

Fair value measurement The main valuation techniques employed in internal models to measure the fair value of the financial instruments on June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are set out below. The principal inputs into these models are derived from observable market data. The Group did not make any material changes to the valuation techniques and internal models it used in those periods. a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost The following tables show the fair value of the financial instruments carried at amortized cost on June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

The credit risk components for both receivables are not part of the hedge strategy. The valuation approach to specific categories of financial instruments is described below. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 49 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; i) Fair value models and inputs Credit card: Credit card receivables and payables to network&#8217;s fair values are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Fair values are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve. For payables, cash flows are also discounted by the Group's own credit spread. For receivables, fair values exclude expected losses. The Group used the rate of recovery of late payments as an input that is not directly observable and was estimated using the Group's internal databases. Loans to customers: Fair value is estimated based on groups of clients with similar risk profiles, using valuation models. The fair value of a loan is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows by the interest rate curve and net interest spread. The Group used the rate of recovery of late payments as an input that is not directly observable and was estimated using the Group's internal databases. Deposits : Most deposit liabilities are payable on demand and therefore can be deemed short-term in nature with the fair value equal to the carrying value. b) Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value The following table shows a summary of the fair values, as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, of the financial assets and liabilities indicated below, classified on the basis of the various measurement methods used by the Group to determine their fair value: &nbsp; &nbsp; 6/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; Published price quotations in active markets (Level 1) &nbsp; Internal Models (Level 2) &nbsp; Internal Models (Level 3) &nbsp; Total Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Government bonds &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brazil &nbsp; 7,546,323 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 7,546,323 United States &nbsp; 431,503 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 431,503 Colombia &nbsp; 469 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 469 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corporate bonds and other instruments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certificate of bank deposits (CDB) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6,053 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6,053 Investment funds &nbsp; - &nbsp; 373,484 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 373,484 Time deposit &nbsp; - &nbsp; 422,930 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 422,930 Bill of credit (LC) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 41 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 41 Real estate and agribusiness letter of credit (CRIs/CRAs) &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,700 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 1,700 Corporate bonds and debentures &nbsp; - &nbsp; 902,215 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 902,215 Equity instrument &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 23,017 &nbsp; 23,017 Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 89,112 &nbsp; (13,001) &nbsp; 33,823 &nbsp; 109,934 Fair value adjustment - portfolio hedge &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6,670) &nbsp; - &nbsp; (6,670) Collateral for credit card operations &nbsp; - &nbsp; 401 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 401 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 86,113 &nbsp; 398 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 86,511 Instruments eligible as capital &nbsp; - &nbsp; 18,554 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 18,554 Repurchase agreements &nbsp; - &nbsp; 16,913 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 16,913 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50 Nu Holdings Ltd.

As a result, all the government bonds are included in level 1 as they are traded in active markets. Fair values are the quoted prices on the secondary market, published by the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Market Entities (&#8220;Anbima&#8221;). Corporate bonds and investment fund quotes, whose valuation is based on observable data, such as interest rates and yield curves, supported by the market, are classified as level 2. Derivatives : Derivatives traded on stock exchanges are classified in level 1 of the hierarchy. Derivatives traded on the Brazilian stock exchange are fairly valued using B3 quotations. Interest rate OTC Swaps are valued by discounting future expected cash flows to present values using interest rate curves based on interest rate futures and are classified as level 2. The embedded derivative conversion feature from the senior preferred share was calculated based on methodologies for the share price described in note 10. The options related to the warrant from Creditas Partnership are fair valued using a Black-Scholes model and are classified as level 3. Equity instrument: For the fair value of the equity instrument, the Group used contractual conditions as input that are not directly observable. Instruments eligible as capital: If the instrument has an active market, prices quoted in this market are used. Otherwise, valuation techniques are used, such as discounted cash flows, where cash flows &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 51 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; are discounted by a risk-free rate and a credit spread. Instruments eligible as capital were designated at fair value through profit or loss in the initial recognition (fair value option). c) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy For the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no transfers of financial instruments between levels 1 and 2 or between levels 2 and 3. 26. Income tax Current and deferred taxes are determined for all transactions that have been recognized in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the current tax laws. The current income tax expense or benefit represents the estimated taxes to be paid or refunded, respectively, for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary tax differences are expected to reverse. a) Income tax reconciliation The tax on the Group's pre-tax profit differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the consolidated entities. The following is a reconciliation of income tax expense to profit (loss) for the period, calculated by applying the combined Brazilian income tax rate of 40% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 06/30/2021 Loss before income tax &nbsp; (92,263) &nbsp; (59,905) Tax rate (i) &nbsp; 40% &nbsp; 40% Income tax benefit &nbsp; 36,905 &nbsp; 23,962 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Permanent additions/exclusions &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Share-based payments &nbsp; (985) &nbsp; (8,541) Customers gifts &nbsp; (72) &nbsp; (125) Operational losses and others &nbsp; (4,978) &nbsp; (1,766) Effect of different tax rates - subsidiaries and parent company &nbsp; (12,792) &nbsp; (16,972) Other non-deductible expenses &nbsp; (669) &nbsp; (1,356) Income tax &nbsp; 17,409 &nbsp; (4,798) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current tax expense &nbsp; (195,301) &nbsp; (83,756) Deferred tax benefit &nbsp; 212,710 &nbsp; 78,958 Income tax in the statement of profit or loss &nbsp; 17,409 &nbsp; (4,798) Deferred tax recognized in OCI &nbsp; 221 &nbsp; 761 Income tax &nbsp; 17,630 &nbsp; (4,037) Effective tax rate &nbsp; -18.9% &nbsp; 8.0% (i) The tax rate used was the one applicable to the financial Brazilian subsidiaries, which represent the most significant portion of the operations of the Group. The tax rate used is not materially different from the average effective tax rate considering all jurisdictions where the Group has operations. The effect of other tax rates is shown in the table above as &#8220;effect of different tax rates &#8211; subsidiaries and parent company&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 52 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; b) Deferred income taxes The following tables present significant components of the Group&#8217;s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and the changes for the periods then ended. The accounting records of deferred tax assets on income tax losses and/or social contribution loss carryforwards, as well as those arising from timing differences, are based on technical feasibility studies which consider the expected generation of future taxable income, considering the history of profitability for each subsidiary individually. The Group has no time limit for use of the deferred tax assets, but the use of the deferred tax asset related to tax loss and negative basis of social contribution is limited to 30% of taxable profit per year for the Brazilian entities. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reflected in the statement of profit or loss &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; Constitution &nbsp; Realization &nbsp; Foreign exchange &nbsp; Reflected in OCI &nbsp; 6/30/2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Provisions for credit losses &nbsp; 204,459 &nbsp; 265,185 &nbsp; (92,796) &nbsp; 5,798 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 382,646 Provision PIS/COFINS - Financial Revenue &nbsp; 5,965 &nbsp; - &nbsp; - &nbsp; 362 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 6,327 Other temporary differences &nbsp; 72,343 &nbsp; 33,351 &nbsp; (12,974) &nbsp; 3,284 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 96,004 Total deferred tax assets on temporary differences &nbsp; 282,767 &nbsp; 298,536 &nbsp; (105,770) &nbsp; 9,444 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 484,977 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tax loss and negative basis of social contribution &nbsp; 77,985 &nbsp; 37,256 &nbsp; (4,194) &nbsp; 2,893 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 113,940 Deferred tax assets &nbsp; 360,752 &nbsp; 335,792 &nbsp; (109,964) &nbsp; 12,337 &nbsp; - &nbsp; 598,917 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Futures settlement market &nbsp; (18,850) &nbsp; (12,990) &nbsp; 8,944 &nbsp; (613) &nbsp; - &nbsp; (23,509) Fair value changes - financial instruments &nbsp; (2,144) &nbsp; (455) &nbsp; 165 &nbsp; (113) &nbsp; (3,047) &nbsp; (5,594) Others &nbsp; (8,340) &nbsp; (5,822) &nbsp; 23 &nbsp; (41) &nbsp; - &nbsp; (14,180) Deferred tax liabilities &nbsp; (29,334) &nbsp; (19,267) &nbsp; 9,132 &nbsp; (767) &nbsp; (3,047) &nbsp; (43,283) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair value changes - cash flow hedge &nbsp; 1,057 &nbsp; 7,650 &nbsp; (10,633) &nbsp; 2,983 &nbsp; 3,268 &nbsp; 4,325 Deferred tax recognized during the period &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 324,175 &nbsp; (111,465) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 221 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 53 Nu Holdings Ltd.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; 28. Management of financial risks, financial instruments, and other risks a) Overview The Group prioritizes risks that could have a material impact on its strategic objectives, including those that must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To efficiently manage and mitigate these risks, the risk management structure conducts risk identification and assessment to prioritize the risks that are key to pursue potential opportunities and/or that may prevent value from being created or that may compromise existing value, with the possibility of having impacts on financial results, capital, liquidity, customer relationship and reputation. Risks that are actively monitored include: Credit risk; Liquidity risk; Market Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB); Operational Risk / Information Technology (IT) Risk; Regulatory Risk; Compliance Risk; and Reputational Risk. b) Risk management structure Nu considers Risk Management an important pillar of the Group's strategic management. The risk management structure broadly permeates the entire Company, allowing risks to be properly identified, measured, mitigated, monitored and reported, in order to support the development of its activities. Risk Management is related to the principles, culture, structures and processes to improve the decision-making process and the achievement of strategic objectives. It is a continuous and evolving process that runs through Nu's entire strategy and its implementation, to support Management in minimizing its losses, as well as maximizing its profits and supporting the Company's values. The Group's risk management structure considers the size and complexity of its business, which allows tracking, monitoring and control of the risks to which it is exposed. The risk management process is aligned with management guidelines, which, through committees and other internal meetings, define strategic objectives, including risk appetite. Conversely, the capital control and capital management units provide support through risk and capital monitoring and analysis processes. The Group considers a risk appetite statement (&#8220;RAS&#8221;) to be an essential instrument to support risk management and decision making. Therefore, its development is aligned with the business plan, strategy and capital development. Nu has defined a RAS (aligned to local regulatory requirements) that prioritizes the main risks and, for each of these, qualitative statements and quantitative metrics expressed in relation to earnings, capital, risk measures, liquidity and other relevant measures were implemented, as appropriate. Nu operates on the three-line model, which helps to identify structures and processes that best support the achievement of objectives and facilitate a robust governance and risk management structure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 59 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; &#9679; First line : business functions and support functions/areas or activities that generate exposure to risks, whose managers are responsible for managing them in accordance with policies, limits and other conditions defined and approved by the Executive Board. The first line must have the means to identify, measure, treat and report risks. &#9679; Second line : consisting of the areas of Risk Management, Internal Controls and Compliance, it ensures an effective control of risks and that they are managed in accordance with the defined appetite level. Responsible for proposing risk management policies, developing risk models and methodologies, and first-line supervision. &#9679; Third line : composed of Internal Audit, it is responsible for periodically independently evaluating whether policies, methods and procedures are adequate, in addition to verifying their effective implementation. Another important element of the risk management framework is the structure of Technical Forums and Committees. These governance bodies were designed and implemented to monitor and make decisions on aspects associated with the Group's management and control. Nu has implemented this structure both at a Global and a country-level perspective, as described below. Global risk-related Governance body: &#9679; Audit and Risk Committee : its main duties are to evaluate the performance and progress of the work of the Internal Audit, the independent audit, as well as the respective reports related to the internal control systems, to follow the recommendations made by the internal and independent auditors to management, to review and discuss with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements, to assist the Board of Directors in the performance of its risk management and control functions, and monitoring the level of risk exposure according to the RAS (consolidated view by geos). It consists of at least three members and meets at least quarterly. Country-level risk-related Governance bodies: Each of the countries where the Group has operations established a structure of governance based on the relevant regulatory requirements and composed of the following elements. Depending on the nature of the subject to be managed, some Committees and meetings can be grouped to cover more than one country. &#9679; Risk Committee : its objective is to assist the country's executive officers in the performance of the entity&#8217;s risk management and control functions, monitoring the level of risk exposure according to risk appetite. It also aims to adopt strategies, policies and measures aimed at disseminating a culture of internal controls and risk mitigation. &#9679; Credit Committee : its objective is to review and supervise credit strategies, as well as review their impacts on the subsidiary's results, and to review the credit strategies in light of the macroeconomic environment and risk information, on the credit market and competitors. &#9679; Audit Committee : its main duties are to evaluate the performance and progress of the work of the Internal Audit function, the independent auditors, and the respective reports related to the internal control systems, to follow the recommendations made by internal and independent &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; auditors to management, and to review and discuss with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements. &#9679; Technical Forums : regular meetings to discuss and propose recommendations to the country-level Risk Committee. Depending on the materiality in each of the countries, each topic listed below can have its own Technical Forum, with the participation of executives from associated areas: accounting and tax, operational risk and internal controls, asset and liability management (&quot;ALM&quot;) / capital, information technology risks (&quot;IT&quot;), data protection, Compliance, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering (&quot;AML&quot;), stress tests, product review and credit provisions. Each Technical Forum has its own charter, establishing the scope of work, voting members and other working model attributes. c) Risks actively monitored The risks that are actively monitored by the Group include credit, market, liquidity, operational, information technology, regulatory, compliance, reputational and capital. The management of these risks is carried out according to the three-line model, considering policies and procedures in place, as well as the limits established in the RAS. Each of the risks described below has its own methodologies, systems and processes for its identification, measurement, evaluation, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation. In the case of financial risks, such as credit, liquidity, IRRBB and market risk, the measurement is carried out based on quantitative models and, in certain cases, prospective scenarios in relation to the main variables involved, respecting the applicable regulatory requirements and best market practices. Non-financial risks, such as operational risk and technological risks, are measured using impact criteria (inherent risk), considering potential financial losses, reputational damage, customer perception and legal/regulatory obligations, as well as evaluated in relation to the effectiveness of the respective structure of internal controls. Based on the results of the measurement and risk assessment activities, the adherence of the residual exposure to Nu's risk appetite is verified. Necessary actions to mitigate risks are presented and discussed in the governance structure (Technical Forums and Risk Committees), which are also the channels responsible for approving and monitoring the implementation of action plans. &#9679; Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the possibility of losses associated with failure of customers or counterparties to pay their contractual obligations; the depreciation or reduction of the expected gains from financial instruments due to the deterioration of the credit quality of customers or counterparties; the costs of recovering the deteriorated exposure; and any advantage given to customers or counterparties due to deterioration in their credit quality. The credit risk control and management structure is independent of the business units, being responsible for the processes and tools to measure, monitor, control and report the credit risk of products and other financial operations, continuously verifying their adherence to the policies and structure of approved limits. There is also an assessment of the possible impacts arising from changes in the economic environment, in order to ensure that the loan portfolio is resilient to economic crises. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 61 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; Credit risk management is carried out by the Credit Risk team with a centralized role independent of the business units, being responsible for: &#9679; Establishing governance, policies and procedures aimed at maintaining exposure to credit risks in accordance with the levels set in the RAS; &#9679; Monitoring and notifying management of the risk levels (appetite compliance) of the credit portfolio, including recommendations for improvement, when applicable; &#9679; Identifying and assessing inherent risks and respective mitigators in the launch of new products and significant changes in existing processes; &#9679; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimating of expected losses according to consistent and verifiable criteria. The Group&#8217;s outstanding balance of financial assets is shown in the table below: Financial assets &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp; 3,701,020 &nbsp; 2,705,675 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 856,994 &nbsp; 815,962 Derivative financial instruments &nbsp; 109,934 &nbsp; 101,318 Collateral for credit card operations &nbsp; 401 &nbsp; 1,052 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss &nbsp; 967,329 &nbsp; 918,332 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Securities &nbsp; 8,850,741 &nbsp; 8,163,428 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income &nbsp; 8,850,741 &nbsp; 8,163,428 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compulsory and other deposits at central banks &nbsp; 1,552,139 &nbsp; 938,659 Credit card receivables &nbsp; 6,478,470 &nbsp; 4,780,520 Loans to customers &nbsp; 1,675,776 &nbsp; 1,194,814 Other credit operations &nbsp; 374,188 &nbsp; 50,349 Other financial assets &nbsp; 61,136 &nbsp; 18,493 Financial assets at amortized cost &nbsp; 10,141,709 &nbsp; 6,982,835 Total &nbsp; 23,660,799 &nbsp; 18,770,270 &#9679; Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as: &#9679; the ability of a bank to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses; and &#9679; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the possibility of not being able to easily exit a financial position due to its size compared to the traded volume in the market. The liquidity risk management structure uses future cash flow data, applying what Nu believes to be a severe stress scenario to these cash flows, in order to measure that the volume of high-quality liquid assets that the Group has is sufficient even in adverse situations.

(i) The gross nominal outflow was projected considering the exchange rate of Brazilian reais, Mexican pesos and Colombian pesos to US$ as of June 30, 2022 (R$5.2568, MXN20.1183 and COP4,155.11 per US$1) and the projected Brazilian CDI, obtained in B3&#8217;s website, for the deposits. &#9679; Market risk and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) Market risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from movements in market risk factors, such as interest rate risk, equities, foreign exchange (FX) rates, commodities prices. IRRBB refers to the current or prospective risk to the bank&#8217;s capital and earnings arising from adverse movements in interest rates that affect the bank&#8217;s banking book positions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 63 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; There is a market risk &amp; IRRBB control and management structure, independent from the business units, which is responsible for the processes and tools to measure, monitor, control and report the market risk and IRRBB, continuously verifying the adherence with the approved policies and limit&#8217;s structure. Management of market risk and IRRBB is based on metrics that are reported to the Asset &amp; Liability Management and Capital (&quot;ALM&quot;) Technical Forum and to the country-level Risk Committee. Management is authorized to use financial instruments as outlined in the Group's internal policies to hedge market risk &amp; IRRBB exposures. Management of market risk and interest rate risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) is based on the following metrics: &#9679; Interest Rate Sensitivity (DV01): impact on the market value of cash flows, when submitted to a one basis point increase in the current annual interest rates or index rate; &#9679; Value at Risk (VaR): maximum market value loss for a holding period with a confidence level; and &#9679; FX exposures: considering all financial positions that bring FX risk and operational expenses in other currencies. The table below presents the VaR, calculated using a confidence level of 95% and a holding period of 1 day, by a historical simulation approach, with a 5-year window. VaR for Nu Holdings is considering only financial assets held directly by Nu Holdings, and it is not considering assets in other countries, including Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Since the last interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2022, the Company changed the VaR model for Nu Holdings, which now uses a confidence level of 99% and a holding period of 10 days. These changes were undertaken so that the risk reflects the management of the amounts.

Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; (1) Includes Nu Financeira and its subsidiary Nu Invest. The following analysis is Nu Holding's sensitivity of the mark to market fair value to an increase of 1 basis point (&#8220;bp&#8221;) (DV01) in the US Risk-Free Curve: Curve &nbsp; US Risk-Free Curve DV01 &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nu Holdings &nbsp; (203) &nbsp; (103) In Brazil, the interest rate risk in subsidiaries other than Nu Pagamentos and Nu Financeira are deemed not relevant as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. To maintain DV01 sensitivities within defined limits, interest rate futures, traded in B3, and swaps derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk. &#9679; Foreign exchange (FX) risk The financial information may exhibit volatility due to the Group&#8217;s operations in foreign currencies, such as the Brazilian real and Mexican and Colombian pesos. At the Nu Holdings level, there is no net investment hedge for investments in other countries. As of June 30, 2022, none of the entities of the Group had significant financial instruments in a currency other than their respective functional currencies. The functional currency of the entities in Brazil is the Brazilian Real, but has operational costs in reais, US dollars and Euros. Certain costs in US Dollars and Euros, or intercompany loans in US dollars, are hedged with futures contracts, traded on the B3 exchange, based on projections of these costs, or when there is new exposure. Hedge transactions are rolled out as costs and borrowings are paid, and adjusted when internal cost projections change. As a result, the financial statements have small exposures to exchange rates after the hedge transactions take effect. &#9679; Operational risk Operational risk is defined as the possibility of losses resulting from external events or from failure, deficiency or inadequacy of internal processes, people or systems. In this context, the legal risk associated with inadequacy or deficiency in contracts signed by Nu, sanctions due to non-compliance with legal provisions and compensations for damages to third parties arising from the activities developed by the Company must also be considered. The structure of control and management of operational risk and internal controls is independent of the business and support units, being responsible for the identification and assessment of operational risks, as well as for evaluating the design and effectiveness of the internal controls, covering risks such as system and services disruption, external fraud and failures in activities in payment scheme arrangements. This structure is also responsible for the preparation and periodic testing of the business continuity plan and for coordinating the risk assessment in new product launches and significant changes to existing processes. Within the governance of the risk management process, mechanisms are presented to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, and report operational risk events to each business and support area (first line), in addition to disseminating the control culture to other employees. The main results of risk assessments are presented &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 65 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; in the Technical Forum on Operational Risk and Internal Controls and in the Risk Committee, when applicable. Applicable improvement recommendations result in action plans with planned deadlines and responsibilities. &#9679; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information Technology (&quot;IT&quot;) risk IT risk is defined as the undesirable effects arising from a range of possible threats to the information technology infrastructure, including cybersecurity (occurrence of information security incidents), incident management (ineffective incident/problem management process, impact about service levels, costs and customer dissatisfaction), identify and access management (unauthorized access to sensitive information), data management (lack of compliance with data privacy laws or gaps in data management governance or data leakage issues), among others. As the Group operates in a challenging environment in terms of cyber threats, it continuously invests in controls and technologies to defend against these threats. Information Technology risks, including cyber risk, are a priority area for the Company thus there is a dedicated IT Risk structure, which is part of the second line. This team is independent from IT-related areas, including Engineering, IT Operations, and Information Security. The IT Risks area is responsible for identifying, evaluating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting Information Technology risks in relation to the risk appetite levels approved by the Executive Board. The Group continually assesses Nu's exposure to threat risk and their potential impacts on the business and customers. The Group continues to improve its IT and cybersecurity capabilities and controls, also considering that people are an essential component of the security strategy, ensuring that the employees and third-party consultants are aware of prevention measures and also know how to report incidents. The results of the IT risk and controls assessments are regularly discussed at the IT Risk Technical Forum and presented to the Risk Committee when applicable. The applicable improvement recommendations result in action plans with planned deadlines and responsibilities. &#9679; Regulatory risk In a complex and highly regulated environment, legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in significant changes to Nu's regulatory framework and consequently its business activities. To address such risks Nu maintains teams in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico dedicated to monitoring these changes and engaging to explain their potential impacts to the company and the broader financial industry. Legislative and regulatory initiatives that can present a material impact to the company are brought to the attention of the Risk Committee and the management team allowing the company, when necessary, to adjust its strategy and decide on the best course of action to deal with such changes. &#9679; Compliance risk As the Group operates in a highly regulated environment, a Compliance program was established within the second line of defense. The Compliance team has resources dedicated to the Ethics Program, Regulatory Compliance as well as to Anti Money Laundering Program and Combating the Financing of Terrorism. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; The Ethics Program sets the minimum conduct standards for the organization, including Code of Conduct, Compliance Policies, Training, and Awareness Campaigns, as well as an independent Whistleblower Channel. Some examples include the AB&amp;C risks, conflict of interest, related parties, insider trading as well as any violations from Nu's Code of conduct. The Regulatory Compliance team is focused on overseeing the regulatory adherence of the organization. Main activities involve regulatory tracking and managing the regulatory adherence, assessment of new products and features, advisory, Compliance testing as well as centralizing the relationship with regulators regarding requests of information and exams. By not being in compliance with laws and regulations, the company may be exposed to sanctions, loss of license as well as potential criminal implications on management. Nu's Anti Money Laundering Program represents the global framework and guidelines for AML/CTF and is the basis for the AML team's strategic planning. It involves the risk of the company being exposed to sanctions for not implementing controls to avoid AML or terrorism financing. The Program is structured in three levels - strategic, tactical and operational - and it's composed of 7 pillars (strategic level): Enterprise Risk Assessment; Policies and Procedures; Communication and Training; Know Your Customer (KYC); Due Diligence (KYE, KYS, KYP and KYB); MSAC - Monitoring, Selection, Analysis and Communication (SAR); and Effectiveness Assessment Program. &#9679; Reputational risk The Group believes that the materialization of other risks can negatively impact its reputation, as they are intrinsically connected. Unfavorable events in different risk areas such as business continuity, cyber security, ethics and integrity, social media negative activity, among others, can damage Nu's reputation. Therefore, the Group has teams and processes in place dedicated to overseeing external communication and for crisis management, which are key elements in identifying and mitigating reputational events, as well as to gain long-term insight to better prevent or respond to future events. &#9679; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stress testing The stress testing program considers shocks/impacts to Nu's main products, such as credit cards, personal loans and funding instruments, in addition to their respective sub-products. Scenarios are considered in which stress is applied in isolation, at different levels of intensity and probability, and also scenarios in which managerial actions are considered to increase the company's resilience and preserve its capital and liquidity indicators. The proposed scenarios are presented to the Stress Testing Technical Forum. The scenarios to be addressed, duration and severity and plausibility of each shock are discussed, as well as the ways in which they will be modeled and the level of detail required. After modeling and executing the tests, the results are submitted to the appropriate committees and technical forums, an integral part of Nu's risk management structure. The proposed actions aimed at ensuring the Organization's resilience are discussed and approved. The Stress Testing Program is updated annually and defines which tests the team must undertake in the next 12 months. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 67 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; &nbsp; 29. Capital management The purpose of capital management is to maintain the capital adequacy for Nu's operation through control and monitoring of the capital position, to evaluate the capital necessity according to the risk taken and strategic aim of the organization and to establish a capital planning process in accordance with future requirements of regulatory capital, based on the Group's growth projections, risk exposure, market movements and other relevant information. Also, the capital management structure is responsible for identifying sources of capital, for writing and submitting the capital plan and capital contingent plan for approval by the Executive Directors. At the executive level, the ALM Technical Forum is responsible for approving risk assessment and capital calculation methodologies, and reviewing, monitoring, and recommending capital-related action plans to the Risk Committee. a) Minimum capital requirements The Group must comply with two different regulatory capital requirements in Brazil: one for the Financial Conglomerate, led by Nu Financeira and composed of Nu Financeira along with Nu DTVM and Nu Invest, and the other applicable to Nu Pagamentos: &#9679; Financial Conglomerate: minimum level of capital, considering the minimum requirements for financial institutions according to Brazilian Federal Monetary Council (&#8220;CMN&#8221;) Resolution 4,958/21. &#9679; Nu Pagamentos: minimum level of capital, considering the minimum requirements for payment institutions, according to Circular BACEN 3,681/13. In September 2021, Nu acquired Nu Mexico Financiera, S.A. de C.V., S.F.P., formerly AKALA, S.A. DE C.V., (&#8220;Akala&#8221;), a Mexican Financial Cooperative Association (&quot;SOFIPO&quot;) and regulated by the CNBV (Comisi&oacute;n Nacional Bancaria Y De Valores). The regulatory capital requirements for this entity are defined by the NICAP metric (&#8220;nivel de capitalizaci&oacute;n&#8221;) set by the CNBV, which is comparable to the Basel Ratio methodology. Nu implemented a capital management structure with the purpose of maintaining a higher level of capital than the minimum regulatory requirements. Additionally, the Group has commenced operations in Colombia and will comply with local rules as soon as regulatory requirements are applicable in this jurisdiction. b) Composition of capital i) Financial conglomerate in Brazil The regulatory capital used to monitor the compliance of a financial conglomerate with the Basel operating limits imposed by the Brazilian Central Bank, is the sum of two items, as follows: &#9679; Tier I Capital: the sum of Common Equity Tier I, which consists of paid in capital, capital, reserves and retained earnings, less deductions, and adjustments and the Additional Tier I, which consists of subordinated debt instruments without a defined maturity that meet eligibility requirements. It is important to note that the Financial Conglomerate does not hold any debt eligible for Additional Tier I on the date of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. &#9679; Tier II Capital: consists of subordinated debt instruments with defined maturity dates that meet eligibility requirements. Together with the Common Equity Tier I it composes the Total Capital. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 68 Nu Holdings Ltd. Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of June 30, 2022 &nbsp; The table below shows the calculation of the capital ratios and their minimum requirement for the Financial Conglomerate, required by the current regulation in Brazil. Notwithstanding the minimum capital adequacy ratio provided under CMN Resolution No. 4,958/21, upon being granted its financial institution license in 2018, Nu Financeira undertook a commitment to operate with a higher Basel Committee minimum capital adequacy ratio of 14.0% during its first five years of operations (i.e., until 2023). &nbsp; Financial Conglomerate &nbsp; 06/30/2022 &nbsp; 12/31/2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regulatory Capital &nbsp; 765,063 &nbsp; 485,498 Tier I &nbsp; 591,505 &nbsp; 467,225 Common Equity &nbsp; 591,505 &nbsp; 467,225 Tier II &nbsp; 173,558 &nbsp; 18,273 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) &nbsp; 3,536,501 &nbsp; 2,144,499 Credit Risk (RWA CPAD) &nbsp; 2,932,063 &nbsp; 1,891,177 Market Risk (RWA MPAD) &nbsp; 27,933 &nbsp; 14,825 Operational Risk (RWA OPAD) &nbsp; 576,505 &nbsp; 238,497 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Capital Required &nbsp; 371,333 &nbsp; 225,172 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Margin &nbsp; 393,730 &nbsp; 260,325 Basel Ratio &nbsp; 21.6% &nbsp; 22.6% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RBAN - Capital Required &nbsp; 32,222 &nbsp; 896 Margin considering RBAN &nbsp; 361,508 &nbsp; 259,429 &nbsp; ii) Nu Pagamentos Nu Pagamentos&#8217; capital management aims to determine the capital needed for its growth and to plan additional sources of capital, to permanently maintain equity in amounts higher than the requirements defined by the Brazilian Central Bank. The subsidiary permanently maintains its shareholders' equity adjusted by the income accounts in an amount corresponding to, at least, the highest amount between i) 2% of the monthly average of payment transactions carried out by the subsidiary in the last 12 (twelve) months; or ii) 2% of the balance of electronic coins issued by the Nu Pagamentos, calculated daily. The table below shows the calculation of the capital ratio and its minimum requirement for Nu Pagamentos, required by the current regulation in Brazil. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 69 Nu Holdings Ltd.
