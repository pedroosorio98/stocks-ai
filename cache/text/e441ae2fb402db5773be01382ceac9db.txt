(&#8220;Broadcom&#8221;) announced that it intends to offer senior notes (the &#8220;New Notes&#8221;) and commence concurrent cash tender offers to purchase the 3.000% Senior Notes due 2022 and 2.200% Senior Notes due 2021 of Broadcom Corporation and 3.125% Senior Notes due 2021 of Broadcom, in each case subject to market conditions and other factors. The New Notes are being sold in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the press release dated April&#160;6, 2020, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. COVID-19 Pandemic Update and Related Risks Below is supplemental disclosure that is intended to be in addition to, not a substitute for, the disclosure provided in our Form 10-Q &#32;filed on March&#160;13, 2020. The global spread of COVID-19 and the efforts to control it have slowed global economic activity and disrupted, and reduced the efficiency of, normal business activities in much of the world. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and factory and office shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers (&#8220;CMs&#8221;), suppliers and logistics providers, particularly if the restrictions on movement intensify or expand to additional countries. In particular, we are experiencing some disruption to parts of our global supply chain, and as a result, there is some uncertainty about how the supply chain will perform if the pandemic worsens significantly or restrictive measures increase. Most of our employees and many of those of our CMs and suppliers around the world are working remotely, or on split or reduced shifts due to facility closures or other restrictions. Our primary warehouse and a number of our outsourced assembly and test service providers are in Malaysia, which has mandated the closure of all non-essential businesses. While our Malaysia warehouse is currently fully operational, pursuant to a critical industry exemption, many of the facilities of our suppliers and service providers are not. An extended closure of these facilities may require us to move assembly and test services to providers in other countries, and may, eventually, lead to a shortage of some components needed for our products. In the event restrictive measures in Malaysia are intensified and our warehouse is shut down or required to operate at a reduced capacity, our ability to deliver product to our customers would be severely limited. In addition, reductions in commercial airline and cargo flights, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure resulting from the pandemic are resulting in increased transport times to deliver materials and components to our facilities and to transfer our products to our assembly and test service providers, and may also affect our ability to timely ship our products to customers. The substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured by TSMC, at their facilities in Taiwan. While the impact of COVID-19 has to date been limited in Taiwan, any increase in the severity of the outbreak or in government measures restricting movement there, may cause a substantial disruption to TSMC&#8217;s operations. This, in turn, would severely reduce our supply of wafers and adversely affect our ability to manufacture most of our products. While our Fort Collins, Colorado manufacturing facility is currently fully operational, any similar disruption there would severely impact our ability to manufacture our FBAR products and adversely affect our wireless business. While the demand environment for our semiconductor products has been consistent with our current expectations during our second fiscal quarter to date, we believe that this is due, in part, to short-term demand to facilitate an increase in manufacture of end products and infrastructure needed to support a dramatic increase around the world in remote or tele-work, as well as the result of some customers stocking up on parts in anticipation of potential future supply chain disruption due to COVID-19. To date, the impact of COVID-19 on the demand environment for our software products has been limited. In the longer-term, however, the COVID-19 &#32;pandemic is likely to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in a global economic downturn and a recession. This would likely adversely affect demand for our products and those of our customers, particularly consumer products such as smartphones, which may, in turn negatively impact our results of operations. However, there is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such downturn or recession. The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the severity of the pandemic, the extent of actions to contain or treat the virus, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic.
