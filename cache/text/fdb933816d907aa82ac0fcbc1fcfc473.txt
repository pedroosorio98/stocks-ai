Increase in Consideration for Cash Tender Offers and Extension of Early Tender Deadline In a press release issued on April&#160;14, 2020, Broadcom Inc. (&#8220;Broadcom&#8221;) announced that it has increased the tender offer consideration in certain of its pending cash tender offers (each, a &#8220;Tender Offer&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Tender Offers&#8221;) to purchase the outstanding notes described below, in each case subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated April&#160;6, 2020, as amended (the &#8220;Offer to Purchase&#8221;), market conditions and other factors. The notes offered to be purchased in the Tender Offers, listed in the order of priority, are the (i) 3.000% senior notes due January&#160;15, 2022, issued by Broadcom Corporation (the &#8220;2022 Notes&#8221;), (ii) 3.125% senior notes due April&#160;15, 2021, issued by Broadcom Inc.
