The economy continues to do quite well despite headwinds related to the Omicron variant, inflation and supply chain bottlenecks. Credit continues to be healthy with exceptionally low net charge-offs, and we remain optimistic on U.S. economic growth as business sentiment is upbeat and consumers are benefiting from job and wage growth.” Dimon continued: “Global IB fees were up 37%, driven by both the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking, due to unprecedented M&A activity, an active acquisition financing market and strong performance in IPOs. Markets revenue was down 11%, compared to a record fourth quarter last year, but up 7% versus the 2019 quarter driven by a strong performance in Equities. Asset & Wealth Management delivered robust results as we saw positive inflows into long-term products of $34 billion across all channels and regions, as well as continued strong loan growth, up 18%, primarily driven by securities-based lending. In Consumer & Community Banking, client investment assets were up 22%, with growth from higher market levels and positive net flows. Combined debit and credit card spend was up 26%, supporting accelerating Card loan growth, up 5%. Auto loans remain elevated, up 7%, although a lack of vehicle supply slowed originations to $8.5 billion, down 23%. Home lending had another strong quarter with originations at $42 billion, up 30%.” Dimon concluded: “In 2021, we extended credit and raised over $3 trillion in capital for our consumer and institutional clients around the world, which includes nonprofits and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. We also accelerated investments to expand our product distribution capabilities, both domestically and internationally, enhance our products and services and modernize our technology. We continue to find attractive opportunities to invest in our businesses across the firm. Our longstanding capital hierarchy remains the same – first and foremost, to invest in and grow our market-leading businesses to support our clients, customers and communities; second, to pay a sustainable competitive dividend; and then, return any remaining excess capital to shareholders.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 4Q21 results included: n $1.8 billion net credit reserve release Firmwide ($0.47 increase in earnings per share (EPS)) n Excluding net credit reserve release 1: 4Q21 net income of $9.0 billion, EPS of $2.86 and ROTCE of 17% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.0 billion, or $1.00 per share n $1.9 billion of common stock net repurchases in 4Q21 4 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $88.07, up 8%; tangible book value per share 1 of $71.53, up 8% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 2 of $214 billion and Standardized ratio2 of 13.0%; Advanced ratio2 of 13.8% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.4% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 4Q21 expense of $17.9 billion; reported overhead ratio of 61%; managed overhead ratio1 of 59% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $3.2 trillion of credit and capital9 raised in 2021 n $331 billion of credit for consumers n $22 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $1.3 trillion of credit for corporations n $1.5 trillion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $63 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities n $11 billion of loans under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in 2021 JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

News Release 5 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $88.07, $86.36 and $81.75 at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. Net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding the Firmwide net credit reserve release are non-GAAP financial measures. The net credit reserve release represents the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. F or fourth-quarter 2021, excluding the net credit reserve release resulted in a decrease of $1.4 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $10.4 billion to $9.0 billion; a decrease of $0.47 per share to reported EPS from $3.33 to $2.86; and a decrease of 2% to ROTCE from 19% to 17%. For full-year 2021, excluding the net credit reserve release at December 31, 2021 resulted in a decrease of 5% to ROTCE from 23% to 18%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 2. Estimated.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective income tax rate.
