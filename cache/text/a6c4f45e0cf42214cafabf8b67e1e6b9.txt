On August 30, 2016, the European Commission (the &#8220;Commission&#8221;) announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to Apple Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the &#8220;State Aid Decision&#8221;). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the &#8220;General Court&#8221;). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court&#8217;s decision to the European Court of Justice (the &#8220;ECJ&#8221;) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. &#160; On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission&#8217;s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, the Company expects to record a one-time income tax charge in its fourth fiscal quarter ending September 28, 2024, of up to approximately $10 billion, which will increase the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the quarter. &#160; The information presented in this Current Report is preliminary and actual results may differ when the Company reports its final results for the fourth quarter. &#160; The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed &#8220;filed&#8221; for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. &#160; This Current Report contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
