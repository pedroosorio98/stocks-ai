OTHER EVENTS. 3 SIGNATURES 4 Table of Contents ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. Board Approval of Stock Split On March 9, 2022, the Board of Directors of Amazon.com, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) approved a 20-for-1 split of the Company&#8217;s common stock to be effected through an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;). The Amendment will also effect a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. The stock split and the proportionate authorized share increase are subject to shareholder approval of the Amendment at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the &#8220;Annual Meeting&#8221;), which is currently scheduled to take place on May 25, 2022. The Company&#8217;s definitive proxy statement relating to the Annual Meeting will include additional details regarding the Amendment. Subject to shareholder approval of the Amendment, each Company shareholder of record at the close of business on May 27, 2022 will have 19 additional shares for every one share held as of such date reflected in their accounts on or about June 3, 2022. Trading is expected to begin on a split-adjusted basis on June 6, 2022. Share Repurchase Authorization On March 9, 2022, the Board of Directors also authorized the Company to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The program allows the Company to repurchase its shares opportunistically from time to time when it believes that doing so would enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration. Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. This stock repurchase authorization replaces the previous $5 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2016, under which the Company had repurchased $2.12 billion of its shares. 3 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. &#160; AMAZON.COM, INC.
