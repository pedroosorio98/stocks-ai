Achieving that takes innovation, collaboration, and a focus on serving others. It also means leading with our values in the technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we share. We&#146;re always working to leave the world better than we found it, and to create powerful tools that empower others to do the same. Below are some highlights of our progress towards advancing our values: accessibility, education, environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy, and supplier responsibility. More information is available at investor.apple.com/esg . &nbsp; Accessibility &nbsp;&nbsp; We create the most accessible products and services in the world &#150; because technology for everyone should meet everyone&#146;s needs. Education &nbsp;&nbsp; We believe education is a great equalizing force and a powerful source of opportunity for all. Environment &nbsp;&nbsp; We believe doing right by the planet is good for people, for communities, and for business. Inclusion&nbsp;&amp; Diversity &nbsp;&nbsp; We&#146;re committed to making our company more inclusive and diverse and the world more just. Privacy &nbsp;&nbsp; We believe privacy is a fundamental human right. Supplier Responsibility &nbsp;&nbsp; We set the highest standards for labor and human rights, working across our global supply chain to expand opportunity and empower people. &nbsp; &nbsp; Environment &nbsp;&nbsp; Teams across Apple are always innovating to make our products better for people and the planet&#151;from the energy that powers our operations, to the materials in our devices, to the companies we do business with. We work with local communities to expand our impact, with a focus on equity and opportunity. Apple is already carbon neutral for our operations, and we&#146;ve set a goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the lifetime usage of our products by 2030. We&#146;re also committed to one day making our products with only recycled and renewable materials. &nbsp;&nbsp; Carbon Neutral for corporate operations since April 2020, using 100% renewable energy for all Apple facilities since 2018 &nbsp; 40% reduction in carbon emissions from 2015 to 2020 &nbsp; 175 Suppliers committed to 100% renewable energy, more than doubling the number of suppliers over the course of 2021 &nbsp; 98% recycled rare earth elements in iPhone 13 devices &nbsp; &nbsp; People in Our Supply Chain &nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and work in a safe and healthy environment. That&#146;s why we set the highest standards for labor and human rights and work diligently to make sure they&#146;re met. We also invest in the people across our global supply chain &#150; with training and educational opportunities to help them achieve their goals. &nbsp;&nbsp; 250,000+ supplier employees directly engaged about their workplace experiences in 2020 &nbsp; 21.5&nbsp;million supplier employees trained on their rights since 2008 &nbsp; 1,121 supplier assessments conducted in 2020 in 53 countries to verify compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct &nbsp; 100% of identified tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners assessed through third-party audits &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 3 Our People &nbsp;&nbsp; We&#146;ve strengthened our long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and the world more just. Where every great idea can be heard. And everybody belongs. &nbsp; We&#146;re making progress toward building an Apple that represents the diverse world around us, and are taking meaningful actions to build more diverse representation across every part of the business. &nbsp;&nbsp; 64% increase in U.S. employees from underrepresented communities from 2014 to&nbsp;2020 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 70% increase in global population of women at Apple from 2014 to 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pay Equity achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Zero Tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination &nbsp; Customers &nbsp;&nbsp; At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Living up to that commitment means staying true to the values that have defined Apple from the beginning. It means creating technology that is accessible for all people. It also means innovating to protect people&#146;s privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right. &nbsp;&nbsp; People Detection Feature award winning health and safety technology for users who are blind and need to maintain social distancing &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Assistive Touch to help users with limb differences navigate Apple Watch through new gestures &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; App Store Privacy Nutrition Labels to drive all apps to help users understand how their data is handled &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; App Tracking Transparency to give users a choice in how apps track and share their data for advertising &nbsp; Communities &nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving the world better than we found it means supporting communities globally with initiatives that advance equity and expand access to opportunity. &nbsp; Our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative is working to address systemic racism, while supporting opportunities for communities of color.

The 2021 compensation earned by our named executive officers reflects our record-breaking net sales and operating income results and outstanding total shareholder return performance across applicable performance periods. Exceptional Leadership. In 2021 we marked the 10th anniversary of Tim Cook&#146;s leadership as CEO. It&#146;s been a remarkable decade for Apple and in 2021 Mr. Cook was granted an equity award for the first time since he was promoted to CEO in August 2011. The structure of this award is better aligned with the performance-based and time-based RSUs awarded to our other named executive officers, while the amount recognizes his exceptional leadership and is commensurate with the size, performance, and profitability Apple has achieved during his tenure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a detailed discussion of our executive compensation program and the 2021 compensation of our named executive officers, see the section entitled &#147;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#148; beginning on page 36.

Table of Contents Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; &nbsp; Corporate Governance This section describes the role and structure&nbsp;of Apple&#146;s Board and our corporate&nbsp;governance framework. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Role of the Board of Directors Apple&#146;s Board oversees the CEO and other senior management in the competent and ethical operation of Apple on a day-to-day basis and assures that the long-term interests of shareholders are being served. To satisfy the Board&#146;s duties, directors are expected to take a proactive, focused approach to their positions to ensure that Apple is committed to business success through the maintenance of high standards of responsibility and ethics. Board Meetings and Attendance The Board met five times during 2021 with each member of the Board serving at the time attending all of the meetings. Apple expects all of its directors to attend the Annual Meeting. All directors serving at the time attended the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Board Independence and Qualifications The Board has determined that all Board members, other than Mr.&nbsp;Cook, are independent under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;). Apple&#146;s Board has a standing Audit and Finance Committee (the &#147;Audit Committee&#148;), Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the &#147;Nominating Committee&#148;). The Board has determined that all committee members are independent under applicable Nasdaq and Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) rules for committee memberships, and that each member of the Audit Committee also meets the additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). The Board has also determined that each Audit Committee member qualifies as an &#147;audit committee financial expert&#148; as that term is defined under SEC rules. Board and Committee Structure Apple regularly reviews the Board&#146;s leadership structure and the responsibilities and composition of its standing committees. The structure and composition of Apple&#146;s Board and its committees are intended to leverage the diverse perspectives of the Board members and promote effective oversight. The Board believes that its current leadership structure, in which the roles of Chair and CEO are separated, best serves the Board&#146;s ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of Apple&#146;s shareholders, including its oversight of management, and Apple&#146;s overall corporate governance. The Board also believes that the current structure allows our CEO to focus on managing Apple, while leveraging our independent Chair&#146;s experience to drive accountability at the Board level.

Each year, the Compensation Committee evaluates whether the design and operation of Apple&#146;s compensation programs or policies encourage our executive officers or our employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks. In establishing and reviewing Apple&#146;s compensation programs for risk, the Compensation Committee considers program features that mitigate against potential risks for our executive officers, such as fixed base salaries; goals that are tied to specific company financial measures and payout caps for the annual cash incentive program; clawbacks for our cash and equity incentives; the quantity and mix of long-term performance-based and time-based equity incentives; and stock ownership requirements. The Compensation Committee also generally considers the program features that mitigate potential risks for our non-executive officer employees. In its annual review, the Compensation Committee concluded that Apple&#146;s executive compensation programs and policies continue to provide an effective and appropriate mix of incentives to help ensure performance is focused on long-term shareholder value creation, and do not encourage short-term risk taking at the expense of long-term results or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Apple.

As an Apple employee, Mr.&nbsp;Cook, our CEO, does not receive compensation for his service as a Board member. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the total compensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. As part of this process, the Compensation Committee evaluates market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC (&#147;Pay Governance&#148;), and makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee Director compensation after reviewing the Compensation Committee&#146;s recommendation. The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (&#147;Director Stock Plan&#148;) provides for an annual limit of $1.5&nbsp;million for all compensation paid to a Non-Employee Director. Cash Retainers. Our Non-Employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $100,000. In 2021, the Chairman of the Board, Dr.&nbsp;Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $200,000; the Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr.&nbsp;Sugar, received an additional cash retainer of $35,000; the Chair of the Compensation Committee, Ms.&nbsp;Jung, received an additional cash retainer of $30,000; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms.&nbsp;Wagner, received an additional cash retainer of $25,000. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments. Equity-Based Awards. A substantial portion of each Non-Employee Director&#146;s annual retainer is in the form of equity awards. Under the Director Stock Plan, Non-Employee Directors are granted restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders (each, an &#147;Annual Director Award&#148;). All Annual Director Awards vest on February&nbsp;1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. For 2021, the number of RSUs underlying each Annual Director Award was determined by dividing $250,000 by the per share closing price of Apple&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. A Non-Employee Director who is newly appointed to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders will receive a grant of RSUs upon appointment (an &#147;Initial Director Award&#148;), except that a Non-Employee Director who first joins the Board on or after February&nbsp;1 of a particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year, or a director who was an employee of Apple immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, will not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based on the portion of the period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest on the next February&nbsp;1 following the grant of the award. Table of Contents &nbsp; 30 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Each RSU granted under the Director Stock Plan will be credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject to the award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for such dividend. The amounts credited to each RSU are referred to as &#147;dividend equivalents.&#148; Any dividend equivalents credited to RSUs granted under the Director Stock Plan will be subject to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. The dividend equivalents are meant to treat the RSU award holders consistently with shareholders. Equipment and Matching Gifts Programs. Apple has an equipment program for the Board under which each Non-Employee Director is eligible to receive, upon request and free of charge, one of each new product introduced by Apple, and is eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Additionally, each Non-Employee Director is eligible to participate in Apple&#146;s matching gifts program to the same extent as Apple employees. Deferred Compensation Plan. We adopted the Apple Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (&#147;Deferred Compensation Plan&#148;) in 2018, effective for deferrals beginning in 2019. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows eligible participants, including our Non-Employee Directors, to defer a portion of their eligible compensation, subject to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded and unsecured. We do not provide any matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan or allow for deferral of RSUs. None of our Non-Employee Directors participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2021. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Apple has stock ownership guidelines for our CEO, executive officers, and Non-Employee Directors. Under the guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected, within five years after the individual first becomes subject to the guidelines, to own shares of Apple&#146;s common stock that have a value equal to five times their annual cash retainer for serving as a director. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual&#146;s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual&#146;s spouse, or the individual&#146;s children. Other than Ms.&nbsp;Lozano and Mr. Gorsky, who joined the Board in calendar year 2021, each Non-Employee Director currently owns shares of Apple&#146;s common stock that have a value at least equal to five times their annual cash retainer.

We reported an all-time record of $365.8 billion in net sales and $108.9 billion in operating income, representing 33% and 64% year-over-year increases, respectively. Our product net sales grew 35% year-over-year with an all-time product net sales record of $297.4 billion. Our services business grew 27% year-over-year with an all-time services net sales record of $68.4 billion. We also continued to advance each of our values and key community initiatives, including expanding our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative and education initiatives and taking new strides toward reaching our 2030 carbon neutral goal across our entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle. &nbsp; In 2021, we also marked the tenth anniversary of Tim Cook&#146;s leadership as CEO. It has been a remarkable decade for Apple, and in 2021 Mr. Cook was granted an equity award for the first time since he was promoted to the CEO role in 2011. As discussed in more detail below, the 2021 RSU award granted to Mr. Cook is better aligned with the performance-based and time-based RSUs awarded to our other named executive officers and provides substantial equity incentives aligned with the interests of our shareholders. &nbsp; The Compensation Committee believes that the 2021 compensation of our named executive officers is commensurate with Apple&#146;s size, performance and profitability, the significant scope of their roles and responsibilities, and their strong values-driven leadership. Our executive compensation program is straightforward, consistent, and effective. While remaining true to our guiding principles and sound compensation policies and practices, our program also has the flexibility to incorporate feedback and evolving compensation practices that are important to us and our shareholders, such as the addition of a modifier based on Apple values and key community initiatives in our short-term cash incentive program. &nbsp; This Compensation Discussion and Analysis explains the guiding principles, policies and practices upon which our executive compensation program is based and the compensation paid to our named executive officers for 2021. &nbsp; Guiding Principles &nbsp; Team-Based Approach &nbsp; We apply a team-based approach to the compensation of our named executive officers with internal pay equity as a primary consideration. &nbsp; Performance Expectations &nbsp; We establish clear, quantitative financial goals and values-driven performance expectations focused on Apple&#146;s overall success and impact. &nbsp; Emphasis on Long-Term Equity Incentives &nbsp; We emphasize long-term performance, retention, and alignment between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders by significantly weighting our named executive officers&#146; compensation toward long-term equity incentives. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Our 2021 Named Executive Officers &nbsp; Tim Cook &nbsp; Chief Executive Officer &nbsp; Luca Maestri &nbsp; Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &nbsp; Kate Adams &nbsp; Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary &nbsp; Deirdre O&#146;Brien &nbsp; Senior Vice President, Retail + People &nbsp; Jeff Williams &nbsp; Chief Operating Officer &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 37 Executive Compensation Policies and Practices We are committed to sound executive compensation policies and practices, as highlighted in the following table. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prohibition on hedging, pledging, and short sales &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We prohibit short sales, transactions in derivatives, hedging, and pledging of Apple securities by our named executive officers. Stock ownership guidelines &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have robust stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers, including a 10 times annual base salary requirement for our CEO. &nbsp; Compensation clawback policy &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our compensation clawback policy allows us to recover annual cash incentives, equity awards, or other amounts that may be paid in respect of awards in the event of certain events, including acts of misconduct by our named executive officers. No repricing &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not allow repricing of stock options without shareholder approval. No change of control&nbsp;payments &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not provide change of control payments or gross-ups of related excise taxes. Vesting requirements for dividend equivalents &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dividend equivalents will not be paid unless the vesting and performance conditions for the RSUs, to which the rights attach, are met. &nbsp; At-will employment &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We employ our named executive officers at-will; our named executive officers do not have employment contracts. No pension or other supplemental benefits &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not provide pensions or supplemental executive health or insurance benefits. &nbsp; No significant perquisites &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We do not provide significant perquisites to our named executive officers. For security and efficiency purposes, Mr.&nbsp;Cook is provided personal security services and is required by the Board to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Annual compensation risk assessment &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Compensation Committee oversees an annual risk assessment of our compensation program. Independent compensation consultant &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Compensation Committee has directly retained an independent compensation consultant that performs no services for Apple other than services for the Compensation Committee. Table of Contents &nbsp; 38 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 2021 Named Executive Officer Compensation Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward outstanding performance in a straightforward, consistent, and effective way, commensurate with Apple&#146;s size, performance, and profitability. The compensation of our named executive officers has three basic components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards. Annual Base Salary Base salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation intended to attract and retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, internal pay equity, and Apple&#146;s financial performance and size relative to peer companies. The annual base salaries for our named executive officers did not change for 2021. Annual Cash Incentive Our annual cash incentive program is a performance-based, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#146; compensation. Variable payouts are designed to motivate our named executive officers to deliver strong annual financial results, while advancing Apple values and key community initiatives. The financial performance measures and payout opportunities under the annual incentive program did not change for 2021, although the design of the program was enhanced to include a modifier based on Apple values and key community initiatives (&#147;ESG Modifier&#148;), as described below. 2021 Financial Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities As in prior years, the Compensation Committee chose net sales and operating income, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as the financial performance measures for the 2021 annual cash incentive program. Net sales and operating income continue to reflect commonly recognized key measures of overall company performance and profitability and are drivers of shareholder value creation. Payouts for our named executive officers under the annual cash incentive program are first determined quantitatively based on an equal weighting of the net sales and operating income performance measures at threshold, target, and maximum performance goal levels. When setting these goals, the Compensation Committee considers factors relevant to the current fiscal year. Financial results from prior years may be used as a reference point, but the Compensation Committee focuses on setting annual goals that reflect current business conditions and expectations and will result in an appropriate pay for performance outcome for the specific fiscal year. The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures is 100% of each named executive officer&#146;s annual base salary. If the threshold performance level is reached for a financial performance measure, the total payout opportunity for that financial performance measure is 50% of the target payout opportunity. If the maximum performance level is reached for a financial performance measure, the total payout opportunity for that financial performance measure is capped at Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 39 200% of the target payout opportunity. If the threshold goal is not achieved for a financial performance measure, there is no payout for that financial performance measure. Payouts for our named executive officers under the annual cash incentive program are linearly interpolated for achievement between threshold, target, and maximum performance goal levels. For 2021, the Compensation Committee considered the likelihood of a range of business scenarios and results that could impact net sales and operating income, including the ongoing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and related business conditions, a complex macro-economic and socio-political environment, and the alignment between appropriate payout opportunities and strong financial results at threshold, target, and maximum performance goal levels. The Compensation Committee set rigorous net sales and operating income goals for 2021 that required year-over-year growth at each payout opportunity. Specifically, our 2021 threshold net sales and operating income goals were both above the prior year&#146;s results, while our 2021 net sales and operating income target goals required significant year-over-year growth. 2021 Financial Performance Goals and Results &nbsp; &nbsp; For 2021 we reported net sales of $365.8 billion and operating income of $108.9 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 33% and 64%, respectively. These results significantly exceeded the maximum goals for each of the financial performance measures. ESG Modifier Beginning in 2021, the Compensation Committee incorporated the ESG Modifier into the annual cash incentive program. The ESG Modifier is based on a holistic evaluation by the Compensation Committee of key accomplishments and actions taken during the year to advance our Apple values: accessibility, education, environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy, and supplier responsibility, and key community initiatives. The Compensation Committee may choose to apply the ESG Modifier to adjust the payout amounts upwards or downwards by up to 10% or determine not to make any adjustments. The Compensation Committee will not apply the ESG Modifier to increase an annual cash incentive payout above the overall cap of 200% of the total target payout opportunity under the program. Table of Contents &nbsp; 40 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; The Compensation Committee chose Apple values and key community initiatives as the basis for the ESG Modifier because they represent long-standing, business-relevant environmental, social, and governance principles that reflect Apple&#146;s commitment to promoting values-driven leadership. 2021 Annual Cash Incentive Payouts Our 2021 net sales and operating income results significantly exceeded the maximum goals set under the annual cash incentive program resulting in a maximum payout for each of our named executive officers equal to 200% of the total target payout opportunity. Before approving the annual cash incentive payouts, the Compensation Committee reviewed with management the actions and key highlights for 2021 representing progress for each of the Apple values and key community initiatives. The review incorporated an extensive environmental, social, and governance scorecard of qualitative and quantitative actions and measures relevant to the fiscal year and a discussion of continuing areas of opportunity. For example, the Compensation Committee considered the significant commitments and efforts made during 2021 in connection with Apple&#146;s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, the meaningful actions being taken to build more diverse representation across every part of the business, new strides toward reaching our 2030 carbon neutral goal across our entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle, and innovations designed to protect people&#146;s privacy such as app tracking transparency and privacy nutrition labels. The Compensation Committee previously determined it will not apply the ESG Modifier to increase a payout above the maximum payout opportunity for 2021 and approved annual cash incentive payouts equal to the maximum 200% of the total target payout opportunity for each of our named executive officers.&nbsp;No adjustment was made based on the ESG Modifier and the Compensation Committee did not exercise its discretion to reduce any named executive officer&#146;s annual cash incentive payout based on Apple&#146;s performance or the Compensation Committee&#146;s subjective assessment of each individual named executive officer&#146;s overall performance. Long-Term Equity Awards We pay for performance and manage Apple for the long-term. Consistent with this approach and our guiding compensation principles, the majority of our named executive officers&#146; annual compensation is provided in the form of long-term equity incentives that emphasize long-term shareholder value creation and the retention of a strong executive leadership team through a balanced mix of performance-based and time-based RSU awards. Performance-Based RSUs RSU awards with performance-based vesting are a substantial, at-risk component of our named executive officers&#146; compensation tied to Apple&#146;s long-term performance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest depends entirely on Apple&#146;s total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&amp;P 500 (&#147;Relative TSR&#148;) for the applicable performance period. To earn a target award, Apple must achieve performance at the 55th percentile of the S&amp;P 500. The Compensation Committee chose Relative TSR as it continues to be an objective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and to align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value. Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 41 We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on the change in each company&#146;s stock price during that period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock. A 20-trading-day averaging period is used to determine the beginning and ending stock price values used to calculate the total shareholder return of Apple and the other companies in the S&amp;P 500. This averaging period mitigates the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period. The change in stock price value from the beginning to the end of the period is divided by the beginning stock price value to determine TSR. Time-Based RSUs RSU awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive team over the longer term. Vesting schedules for time-based awards are generally longer than typical peer company practices, as described below. Dividend Equivalents All RSUs granted to our employees in 2021, including our named executive officers, have dividend equivalent rights. The dividend equivalents will only pay out if the time-based vesting and performance conditions have been met for the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. 2021 RSU Results CEO RSU Vesting This year marked the 10-year anniversary of Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s tenure as Apple&#146;s CEO and the vesting of the final tranche of the long-term RSU award granted upon his promotion to CEO in 2011 (the &#147;2011 RSU Award&#148;). Mr.&nbsp;Cook earned significant long-term incentives over the course of a decade, aligning his compensation with the extraordinary value created for our shareholders under his leadership. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; 42 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; At grant, the 2011 RSU Award had a time-based vesting schedule with 50% of the RSUs vesting on each of the 5- and 10-year anniversaries of the grant date. The 2011 RSU Award was significantly modified in 2013, at Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s request, to put a portion of the award at risk by applying a performance condition based on Apple&#146;s Relative TSR performance over specified performance periods. The 2011 RSU Award was not modified to include dividend equivalents. The performance condition for Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s 2011 RSU Award required Apple to outperform two-thirds of the companies that were included in the S&amp;P 500 for the entirety of each performance period in order for 100% of the performance-based RSUs allocated to that period to vest. The 2011 RSU Award only had downside risk to Mr.&nbsp;Cook. It did not contain any upside vesting opportunity above 100% of the target number of RSUs, and there was no interpolation for results between the Relative TSR levels set at the bottom, middle, and top third of companies in the S&amp;P 500. &nbsp; Relative TSR Percentile v. S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp;&nbsp; Performance-Based RSUs Vesting Top Third &nbsp;&nbsp; 100% Middle Third &nbsp;&nbsp; 50% Bottom Third &nbsp;&nbsp; 0% For the final three-year performance period under the 2011 RSU Award from August&nbsp;25, 2018 through August&nbsp;24, 2021, Apple&#146;s Relative TSR was at the 97th percentile of the companies that were included in the S&amp;P 500 for the entire performance period. As a result, 100% of the target 1,120,000 performance-based RSUs for this performance period vested on August&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2021. Apple&#146;s total shareholder return during this performance period was 191.83%. On August&nbsp;24, 2021, Mr.&nbsp;Cook also vested in the remaining 3,920,000 time-based RSUs under his 2011 RSU Award. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relative&nbsp;TSR&nbsp;Percentile&nbsp;Ranking for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Period &nbsp; TSR&nbsp;Results for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance Period &nbsp; Apple &nbsp; &nbsp; 97th Percentile &nbsp; &nbsp; 191.83% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp; Top Third &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8805; 72.26% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle Third &nbsp; &nbsp; 24.94-72.25% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom Third &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;24.94% &nbsp; Other Named Executive Officer Performance-Based RSU Vesting During 2021, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri and Mr.&nbsp;Williams each vested in performance-based RSUs that were granted on October&nbsp;1, 2017. Ms.&nbsp;Adams vested in performance-based RSUs that were granted on November&nbsp;13, 2017, her date of hire. Between zero and 200% of the target number of these performance-based RSUs were scheduled to vest based on Apple&#146;s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the applicable performance period, with a maximum 200% vesting for performance at or above the 85th percentile.

Apple&#146;s Relative TSR was at the 99 th percentile of the companies that were included in the S&amp;P 500 and Apple&#146;s total shareholder return during this period was 181.64%. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relative&nbsp;TSR&nbsp;Percentile&nbsp;Ranking for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Period &nbsp; TSR&nbsp;Results for&nbsp;Three-Year&nbsp;Performance Period &nbsp; Apple &nbsp; 99th Percentile &nbsp; 181.64% &nbsp; &nbsp; S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp; 85th Percentile &nbsp; 69.20% &nbsp; &nbsp; 55th Percentile &nbsp; 17.13% &nbsp; &nbsp; 25th Percentile &nbsp; -22.25% &nbsp; &nbsp; Below 25th &nbsp; &lt;-22.25% 2021 RSU Awards All of our named executive officers received equity awards in the form of performance-based and time-based RSUs in 2021. This is the first time Mr. Cook has been granted an equity award since his promotion to the CEO role in 2011. The structure and timing of Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award transitions his equity incentives to better align with the performance- and time-based RSUs granted to our other named executive officers. The value used to determine the number of RSUs granted to our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook, remained consistent year-over-year. The value used to determine the number of RSUs granted to Mr. Cook was determined by the Compensation Committee after taking into consideration the size, performance, and profitability of Apple relative to peer companies, the scope of the CEO role, and Mr. Cook&#146;s performance as CEO. Table of Contents &nbsp; 44 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 2021 Performance-Based RSU Awards Performance-based RSUs were granted to Mr.&nbsp;Cook, Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams on September&nbsp;27, 2020, which was the first day of Apple&#146;s 2021 fiscal year and the first day of the performance period applicable to the awards. These awards have a three-fiscal-year performance period from the beginning of 2021 through the end of 2023. Subject to the terms of the award agreements, between zero and 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs will vest on October&nbsp;1, 2023, depending on Apple&#146;s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the performance period, as follows: &nbsp; Relative TSR Percentile v. S&amp;P 500 Companies &nbsp;&nbsp; Performance-Based RSUs Vesting As a Percentage of Target 85th Percentile or above &nbsp;&nbsp; 200% 55th Percentile &nbsp;&nbsp; 100% 25th Percentile &nbsp;&nbsp; 25% Below 25th &nbsp;&nbsp; 0% If Apple&#146;s TSR for the performance period is negative, the number of performance-based RSUs that will vest is capped at 100% of the target number of performance-based RSUs regardless of our percentile ranking. If Apple&#146;s Relative TSR percentile ranking is above the 25th percentile and between the other levels shown in the table above, the portion of the performance-based RSUs that will vest is linearly interpolated between the two nearest vesting percentages. The target number of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr.&nbsp;Cook was determined by dividing $37.5&nbsp;million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The target number of performance-based RSUs granted to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams was determined by dividing $10&nbsp;million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair values of these awards are reported in the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019.&#148; 2021 Time-Based RSU Awards The 2021 time-based RSUs awarded to Mr.&nbsp;Cook, Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams were granted on September&nbsp;27, 2020, which was the first day of Apple&#146;s 2021 fiscal year. Subject to the terms of the award agreements, the vesting schedule for these RSUs is approximately four and one-half years, with three equal installments vesting annually commencing on April&nbsp;1, 2023 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date). The April vesting dates for the time-based RSUs were selected to balance the October vesting of the performance-based RSUs and provide regular vesting intervals. The number of time-based RSUs granted to Mr.&nbsp;Cook was determined by dividing $37.5&nbsp;million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The target number of time-based RSUs granted to Ms.&nbsp;Adams, Mr.&nbsp;Maestri, Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien, and Mr.&nbsp;Williams was determined by dividing $10&nbsp;million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for these awards is reported in the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019.&#148; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 45 Compensation Committee Judgment and Discretion The Compensation Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, reviews and approves the compensation of Apple&#146;s named executive officers and acts as the administering committee for Apple&#146;s employee equity compensation plans. The Compensation Committee&#146;s executive compensation determinations are subjective and the result of its business judgment, which is informed by the experience of its members and input provided by its independent compensation consultant, our CEO (other than with respect to his own compensation), other members of management, and our shareholders. Each year, the Compensation Committee conducts an evaluation of Apple&#146;s executive compensation program to determine any appropriate changes. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee may consult with its independent compensation consultant and management, as described below; however, the Compensation Committee makes final decisions regarding the compensation paid to our named executive officers based on its own judgment. In determining whether to make changes to our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee may consider a number of factors, including the size, scope, and performance of our business, evolving compensation trends, financial goals, and shareholders&#146; interests. The Role of the Compensation Consultant The Compensation Committee selects and retains the services of its own independent compensation consultant and annually reviews the performance of the consultant. As part of the review process, the Compensation Committee considers the independence of the consultant in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. During 2021, the Compensation Committee&#146;s independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, provided no services to Apple other than services for the Compensation Committee, and worked with Apple&#146;s management, as directed by the Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the Compensation Committee is responsible. At the Compensation Committee&#146;s request, Pay Governance regularly attends Compensation Committee meetings. Pay Governance also communicates with the Compensation Committee or the Chair of the Compensation Committee outside committee meetings regarding matters related to the Compensation Committee&#146;s responsibilities. In 2021, the Compensation Committee generally sought input from Pay Governance on a range of external market factors related to Apple&#146;s compensation programs, CEO pay, environmental, social, and governance performance metrics and other evolving compensation trends, appropriate market reference points, and market compensation data. Pay Governance also provided general observations about management&#146;s recommendations regarding the amount and form of compensation for our named executive officers. The Role of the Chief Executive Officer At the Compensation Committee&#146;s request, Mr.&nbsp;Cook provides input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s evaluation and his direct knowledge of each named executive officer&#146;s performance and contributions when making compensation decisions. Mr.&nbsp;Cook is not present during Compensation Committee voting or deliberations regarding his own compensation. Table of Contents &nbsp; 46 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; The Role of Shareholders Shareholders are provided the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers and have indicated their strong support for the compensation of our named executive officers in each of the past six years. Most recently, 95% of votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal at the 2021 Annual Meeting voted in favor of our executive compensation program. We have ongoing discussions with many of our shareholders regarding various topics, including company performance and strategy, corporate governance, executive compensation, and environmental, social, and governance topics. The Compensation Committee considers these discussions while reviewing our executive compensation program and will continue to consider shareholder feedback and the results of say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions. The Role of Peer Companies The Compensation Committee reviews and approves peer group composition each year. With the assistance of Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee identified groups of companies to serve as market reference points for compensation comparison purposes for 2021. A primary peer group was developed for reference consisting of U.S.-based, stand-alone, publicly traded companies in the technology, media, and internet services industries that, in the Compensation Committee&#146;s view, compete with Apple for talent. The threshold revenue and market capitalization requirements for a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2021 were $15&nbsp;billion and $50&nbsp;billion, respectively. Based on the above criteria, there were no changes made to the primary peer group for 2021. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 Primary Peer Group Alphabet &nbsp; AT&amp;T &nbsp; Cisco &nbsp; Disney &nbsp; Intel &nbsp; Microsoft &nbsp; Oracle &nbsp; Verizon Amazon &nbsp; Charter &nbsp; Comcast &nbsp; IBM &nbsp; Meta &nbsp; Netflix &nbsp; Qualcomm &nbsp; Visa &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple Relative to Primary Peers &nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 47 As shown above, Apple remains considerably larger than the typical company in the primary peer group with approximately five times the revenue and approximately nine times the market capitalization of the median peer company data for each of the screening criterion. Revenue shown is based on the trailing 12 months revenue of each of our peer companies ending closest to our 2021 fiscal year-end. Market capitalization for peer group companies is the amount provided by Bloomberg L.P. as of September 24, 2021, the last trading day of Apple&#146;s 2021 fiscal year. A secondary peer group of premier companies that have iconic brands or are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development and innovation for growth, and require highly-skilled employees was also developed as an additional reference set for the Compensation Committee. Based on the above criteria, Tesla, Inc. was added to the secondary peer group for 2021. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 Secondary Peer Group &nbsp; 3M &nbsp; Boeing &nbsp; General Electric &nbsp; Nike &nbsp; Pfizer &nbsp; Tesla American Express &nbsp; Coca-Cola &nbsp; Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson &nbsp; PepsiCo &nbsp; Procter&nbsp;&amp; Gamble &nbsp; UnitedHealth Group The Compensation Committee considers peer group data provided by its independent compensation consultant and reviews compensation practices and program design at peer companies to inform its decision-making process so it can set total compensation levels that it believes are commensurate with the relative size, scope, performance and profitability of Apple. The Compensation Committee, however, does not set compensation components to meet specific benchmarks as compared to peer companies, such as targeting salaries or total compensation at a specific market percentile. References in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis to peer companies include both the primary and the secondary peer group companies. Other Benefits Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare programs, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) plan, and matching gifts, vacation cash-out, product discount and other benefit programs on the same basis as other employees. Items or services provided to our named executive officers that may be considered perquisites are limited and generally do not have an associated incremental cost to the company, except as discussed below and as reported in the table entitled &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019.&#148; Deferred Compensation Plan. &nbsp;Our named executive officers&nbsp;are eligible to defer a portion of their&nbsp;eligible compensation under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, including a portion of their base salary and annual cash incentive opportunity. Security and Private Aircraft. We provide risk-based, business-related, and personal security services for our employees, including our named executive officers, as determined to be appropriate by our security team. We consider the security measures provided to our named executive officers to be reasonable and necessary expenses for the benefit of Apple and not a personal benefit. However, in accordance with SEC disclosure rules, the aggregate incremental cost of these services is reported in the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019.&#148; Table of Contents &nbsp; 48 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; In the interests of security and efficiency based on our global profile and the highly visible nature of Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s role as CEO, the Board requires that Mr.&nbsp;Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr.&nbsp;Cook recognizes imputed taxable income and is not provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of private aircraft. Compensation Upon Termination of Employment . Our named executive officers do not have employment contracts or severance arrangements. Further, our named executive officers are not entitled to acceleration of their equity awards or any other payments upon a change in control. The time-based RSU award agreements for all of our employees, other than Mr. Cook, provide for full vesting upon a termination due to death and pro-rata vesting upon a termination due to disability. The performance-based RSU award agreements for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata vesting upon a termination due to death or disability. The 2021 time-based RSU agreement for Mr. Cook provides for full vesting upon a termination of employment due to death and a continued right to receive shares upon a termination of employment due to disability or retirement, if termination occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The 2021 performance-based RSU agreement for Mr. Cook provides for a continued right to receive shares upon a termination due to death, disability, or termination of employment due to retirement if termination occurs on or following the first anniversary of the grant date, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. Retirement is defined in Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award agreements as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and at least 10 years of service with Apple. Under the terms of Mr. Cook&#146;s RSU award agreements, if retirement occurs on or following the first anniversary of the grant date, the shares underlying his 2021 RSU award will continue to be released on the original vesting dates, subject to the terms of the award agreements and the attainment of the performance goals for the performance-based RSUs. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such RSUs are not accelerated upon retirement. The Compensation Committee approved this provision in Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award agreements to recognize the unique impact of his leadership decisions on the long-term direction of the company, and to continue to focus and align his incentives with our other named executive officers&#146; incentives. Governance and Other Considerations Tax Deductibility of Compensation Expense. &nbsp;Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally places a $1&nbsp;million limit on the amount of compensation a publicly held company can deduct in any tax year on compensation paid to each &#147;covered employee&#148; which includes our named executive officers. While the Compensation Committee considers tax deductibility as one of many factors in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee will award or modify compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if such compensation is not tax deductible by Apple. Compensation Clawback. The terms of all outstanding RSU awards held by our named executive officers allow us to recoup any shares or other amount that may be paid in respect of RSUs in the event the named executive officer engages in certain acts of misconduct. The compensation recoupment policy also applies to the annual cash incentives awarded to our named executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in the event the named executive officer commits a felony while employed by Apple or, while employed by Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 49 Apple or at any time thereafter, the named executive officer engages in a breach of confidentiality, materially breaches any agreement with Apple, commits an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud, or if Apple is required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of the named executive officer&#146;s misconduct. Prohibition on Hedging, Pledging, and Short Sales. We prohibit short sales, hedging, and transactions in derivatives of Apple securities for all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, and consultants. In addition, we prohibit pledging of Apple stock as collateral by directors and executive officers of Apple. We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange funds. Stock Ownership Guidelines. Under our stock ownership guidelines, Mr.&nbsp;Cook is expected to own shares of Apple stock that have a value equal to 10 times his annual base salary. All other executive officers are expected to own shares that have a value equal to three times their annual base salary within five years of the officer first becoming subject to the guidelines. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with or separately by the individual&#146;s spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual&#146;s spouse, or the individual&#146;s children. Each executive officer currently holds shares in excess of these guidelines. Risk Considerations. In establishing and reviewing Apple&#146;s executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and has concluded that it does not. See the section entitled &#147;Corporate Governance&#150;Board Oversight of Risk Management&#148; above for an additional discussion of risk considerations. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the disclosures contained in the &#147;Compensation Discussion and Analysis.&#148; Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the section entitled &#147;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#148; be included in this Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting. &nbsp; Members of the Compensation Committee &nbsp; Andrea&nbsp;Jung&nbsp;(Chair) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Al&nbsp;Gore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Art&nbsp;Levinson Table of Contents &nbsp; 50 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Executive Compensation Tables Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019 The following table, footnotes, and related narrative show information regarding the total compensation of each named executive officer for 2021, 2020, and 2019. &nbsp; Name and Principal Position&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Year &nbsp; &nbsp; Salary ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonus ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Awards (1) ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation (2) ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; All Other Compensation ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; Total ($) &nbsp; Tim Cook Chief Executive Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 82,347,835 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,386,559 (3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 98,734,394 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10,731,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,038,259 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,769,259 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7,671,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 884,466 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11,555,466 &nbsp; Luca Maestri Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,959,620 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18,883 (4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,978,503 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18,583 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,253,270 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,633,416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,557,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19,221 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25,209,637 &nbsp; Kate Adams Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,959,620 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,533 (5) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,974,153 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,310 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,248,995 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,633,416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,557,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 41,384 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25,231,800 &nbsp; Deirdre O&#146;Brien Senior Vice President, Retail + People &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,959,620 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 61,191 (6) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27,020,811 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 37,684 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,272,371 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 877,500 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16,469,527 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,795,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,753 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 19,159,780 &nbsp; Jeff Williams Chief Operating Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,959,620 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,437 (7) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,977,057 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,657,687 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,577,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,137 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26,251,824 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21,633,416 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,557,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,503 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25,207,919 &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) The grant date fair value for time-based RSUs is measured in accordance with FASB ASC 718 and based on the closing price of Apple&#146;s common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for performance-based RSUs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo model for each award on the date of grant, as determined under FASB ASC 718 based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. The fair value for each award may differ based on the applicable data, assumptions, and estimates used in the model. See Note 1&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies found in Part II, Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September&nbsp;25, 2021, and also see footnote 1 to the table entitled &#147;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&#151;2021.&#148; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 51 (2) As described under &#147;Executive Compensation&#151;Compensation Discussion and Analysis,&#148; the named executive officers&#146; annual cash incentives are based on the performance of Apple relative to predetermined financial goals for the year and the performance of the individual named executive officer. The threshold, target, and maximum payout amounts for each named executive officer&#146;s 2021 annual cash incentive opportunity are shown in the table entitled &#147;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&#151;2021.&#148; In 2021, Apple&#146;s performance exceeded the maximum performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a total payout of 200% of the total preliminary target payout opportunity for each named executive officer, which represents the maximum amount payable under the annual cash incentive plan. The Compensation Committee will not apply the ESG Modifier to increase an annual cash incentive payout above the overall cap of 200% of the total payout under the program and did not decrease the total payout. The Compensation Committee further determined that no downward adjustments would be made based on Apple&#146;s or an individual&#146;s performance and approved this payout amount for each named executive officer. &nbsp; (3) This amount represents: (i)&nbsp;Apple&#146;s contributions to Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,400; (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $2,964; (iii) vacation cash-out in the amount of $23,077; (iv) security expenses in the amount of $630,630, which represents the incremental cost to Apple for personal security services provided to Mr.&nbsp;Cook as determined by allocating both direct costs and a percentage of fixed costs incurred by Apple and used to provide such personal security services; and (v)&nbsp;personal air travel expenses in the amount of $712,488, which represent the incremental cost to Apple for Mr.&nbsp;Cook&#146;s personal use of private aircraft based on hourly flight charges and other variable costs incurred by Apple for such use, including variable fuel charges, departure fees, and landing fees. For security and efficiency reasons, the Board implemented a policy in 2017 that requires Mr.&nbsp;Cook to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. &nbsp; (4) This amount represents: (i)&nbsp;Apple&#146;s contributions to Mr.&nbsp;Maestri&#146;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,400; and (ii)&nbsp;term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $1,483. &nbsp; (5) This amount represents: (i)&nbsp;Apple&#146;s contributions to Ms.&nbsp;Adams&#146; account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $13,050; and (ii)&nbsp;term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $1,483. &nbsp; (6) This amount represents: (i)&nbsp;Apple&#146;s contributions to Ms.&nbsp;O&#146;Brien&#146;s account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,400; (ii) term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $1,483; and (iii)&nbsp;vacation cash-out in the amount of $42,308. &nbsp; (7) This amount represents: (i)&nbsp;Apple&#146;s contributions to Mr.&nbsp;Williams&#146; account under the 401(k) plan in the amount of $17,400; and (ii)&nbsp;term life insurance premiums paid by Apple in the amount of $37. The amounts in the salary, bonus, and non-equity incentive plan compensation columns of the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019&#148; reflect actual amounts earned in the relevant years, while the amounts in the stock awards column reflect accounting values determined as of the date of grant. The tables entitled &#147;Outstanding Equity Awards&#151;2021&#148; and &#147;Stock Vested&#151;2021&#148; provide further information on the named executive officers&#146; potential realizable value and actual value realized with respect to their equity awards. The &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#151;2021, 2020, and 2019&#148; should be read in conjunction with the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the subsequent tables and narrative descriptions.

Description of Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Our named executive officers and Non-Employee Directors are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred Compensation Plan participants may elect to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and commissions and up to 90% of their eligible cash bonus, or up to 100% of their annual cash retainer in the case of Non-Employee Directors, by timely completing a deferral election form. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan, as adjusted for applicable earnings gains and losses and fees, are credited to an account in the participant&#146;s name and remain fully vested at all times. Participants may select at any time from a diversified menu of notional investment options that generally mirror the investment options of Apple&#146;s 401(k) plan, and the value of their Deferred Compensation Plan account balance may increase or decrease based on the performance of their selected investment options. In 2021, annual returns on the investment options available for the Deferred Compensation Plan generally ranged from -0.90% to 69.16%. Deferred Compensation Plan participants may elect to receive distributions of their deferred amounts either upon separation from service or as of a specified in-service distribution date. Distributions will be made in a lump sum payment unless the participant elects installment payments between two and 10 years. A Deferred Compensation Plan participant may also request to receive a hardship distribution on account of an eligible unforeseeable emergency. If a Deferred Compensation Plan participant dies prior to receiving a complete distribution of their account, the remaining account will be paid to their beneficiaries in a lump sum by December&nbsp;31 of the year following the participant&#146;s death. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control We do not have any cash severance arrangements with our named executive officers, and none of our named executive officers&#146; equity awards outstanding as of 2021 fiscal year-end provide for acceleration in connection with a change of control, other than as noted below in connection with termination of employment due to death, disability, or for Mr.&nbsp;Cook, retirement. &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 57 Equity Acceleration Upon Termination of Employment Time-Based RSUs. Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 time-based RSU award provides for full accelerated vesting upon death and a continued right to receive the shares underlying the RSUs upon disability or termination of employment due to retirement if termination occurs on or following the first anniversary of the grant date. Retirement is defined in Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award agreements as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and at least 10 years of service with Apple. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such RSU award are not accelerated upon retirement. If Mr. Cook meets these conditions and retires on or following the first anniversary of the grant, the shares underlying his 2021 time-based RSUs will continue to be released on the original vesting dates, subject to the terms of the award agreement. For our other named executive officers, subject to the terms of the award agreement, time-based RSUs provide for partial accelerated vesting of the RSUs scheduled to vest on the next applicable vesting date following a termination of employment due to disability and for full accelerated vesting upon death. Performance-Based RSUs . Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 performance-based RSU award provides for a continued right to receive earned shares underlying the RSUs upon death, disability, or termination of employment due to retirement if termination occurs on or following the first anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook retires on or following the first anniversary of the grant date grant, the shares underlying his 2021 performance-based RSUs will continue to be released on the original vesting dates, subject to the terms of the award agreement and the attainment of the performance goals. For our other named executive officers, subject to the terms of the award agreement, performance-based RSUs provide for a partial waiver of the service vesting condition upon the death or disability of the award recipient, with the number of shares that vest determined at the end of the performance period, based on actual performance results and prorated based on the recipient&#146;s dates of employment during the performance period. The following table shows the estimated amounts that the named executive officers would have become entitled to under the terms of all RSUs outstanding as of fiscal year-end had their employment terminated due to death or disability for each of our named executive officers, or retirement for Mr. Cook, on September 25, 2021, the last day of Apple&#146;s 2021 fiscal year. Under the terms of Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award, there is no difference in the payment terms between a termination due to death, disability, or retirement occurring more than one year following the date of grant. Since the first anniversary of the grant date of Mr. Cook&#146;s 2021 RSU award occurred after September 25, 2021, he did not meet this requirement in 2021. The estimated values for performance-based RSUs are shown at the maximum potential payout amounts, and would be subject to the terms of the award agreements. &nbsp; Name &nbsp; Estimated&nbsp;Total&nbsp;Value&nbsp;of Equity&nbsp;Acceleration&nbsp;upon&nbsp;Death (1) ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Estimated&nbsp;Total&nbsp;Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Equity Acceleration upon Disability (1) ($) &nbsp; Tim Cook &nbsp; &nbsp; 148,059,777 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 148,059,777 &nbsp; Luca Maestri &nbsp; &nbsp; 168,474,466 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 117,337,786 &nbsp; Kate Adams &nbsp; &nbsp; 155,735,090 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 111,194,893 &nbsp; Deirdre O&#146;Brien &nbsp; &nbsp; 134,038,409 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 88,404,876 &nbsp; Jeff Williams &nbsp; &nbsp; 168,474,466 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 117,337,786 &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) The dollar amounts are determined by (i)&nbsp;multiplying the number of RSUs that would have been subject to accelerated vesting if an officer had died or become disabled, on September&nbsp;25, 2021, as applicable, by $146.92, the closing price of Apple&#146;s common stock on September 24, 2021, the last trading day of the fiscal year; and (ii)&nbsp;then adding any accumulated dividend equivalents attributable to any such RSUs on that date. Table of Contents &nbsp; 58 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; CEO Pay Ratio&#151;2021 We offer a wide range of benefits to our global employee population and we are committed to paying our employees competitively and equitably based on their role. In 2021, we selected a new median employee due to changes in our hiring trends and material changes to our employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believed would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. We determined our median compensated employee by using base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2021 as our consistently applied compensation measure. We applied this measure to our global employee population as of September 25, 2021, the last day of our 2021 fiscal year, and annualized base salaries for permanent full-time and part-time employees that did not work the full year. We calculated the median compensated employee&#146;s 2021 annual total compensation using the same methodology that is used to calculate our CEO&#146;s annual total compensation in the table entitled &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#150;2021, 2020, and 2019.&#148; The 2021 annual total compensation of our CEO was $98,734,394, the 2021 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $68,254, and the ratio of these amounts is 1,447 to 1. Thus, this pay ratio reflects a reasonable estimate consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology we described above. Because SEC rules for identifying a median compensated employee allow companies to apply certain exclusions, include estimates, and adopt different methodologies that reflect their employee population and compensation practices, the ratio above may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other companies.

Holders of proxies solicited by this Proxy Statement will vote the proxies received by them as directed on the proxy card or, if no direction is made, for the election of the Board&#146;s nine nominees. &nbsp; The term of any incumbent director who does not receive the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum, and has not earlier resigned, will end on the date that is the earlier of (a) 90 days after the date on which the voting results for the Annual Meeting are determined by the inspector of election, or (b)&nbsp;the date on which the Board selects a person to fill the office held by that director in accordance with Apple&#146;s bylaws. &nbsp; Each of the directors nominated by the Board has consented to serving as a nominee, being named in this Proxy Statement, and serving on the Board if elected. Each director elected at the Annual Meeting will be elected to serve a one-year term. If any nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders may vote for any nominee designated by the present Board to fill the vacancy. &nbsp; There are no family relationships among Apple&#146;s executive officers and directors. &nbsp; For more information on the director nominees, please see the section entitled &#147;Directors&#148; beginning on page 21. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Apple has implemented majority voting in uncontested elections of directors. Accordingly, Apple&#146;s bylaws provide that in an uncontested election of directors the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum is required to elect a director. &nbsp; The Board recommends that&nbsp;shareholders vote FOR each of the nominees. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 61 Proposal No.&nbsp;2 Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm &nbsp; The Audit Committee has re-appointed Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm and as auditors of Apple&#146;s consolidated financial statements for 2022. The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm annually. In making the determination to re-appoint Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young for 2022, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors, the independence and performance of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young, and the quality and candor of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young&#146;s communications with the Audit Committee and management. Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young has served as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm since 2009. &nbsp; At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for 2022. Although ratification of the Audit Committee&#146;s appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young is not required, we value the opinions of our shareholders and believe that shareholder ratification of the appointment is a good corporate governance practice. In the event of a negative vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. Representatives of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to questions. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;2 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No.&nbsp;2. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; 62 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Fees Paid to Auditors The following table shows the fees billed by Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended September&nbsp;25, 2021 and September&nbsp;26, 2020. &nbsp; Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young &nbsp; 2021 ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 ($) &nbsp; Audit Fees (1) &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,683,114 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,568,300 &nbsp; Audit&#151;Related Fees (2) &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,161,409 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 935,900 &nbsp; Tax Fees (3) &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,662,997 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,382,300 &nbsp; All Other Fees (4) &nbsp; &nbsp; 715,310 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 297,400 &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; 23,222,830 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22,183,900 &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of Apple&#146;s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. &nbsp; (2) Audit-related fees relate to professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Apple&#146;s financial statements. &nbsp; (3) Tax fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to tax returns and tax audits, as well as for tax consulting and planning services. Tax fees in 2021 include $1.1&nbsp;million for tax compliance projects and $2.6&nbsp;million for tax advisory projects. Tax fees in 2020 include $1.1&nbsp;million for tax compliance projects and $2.3&nbsp;million for tax advisory projects. &nbsp; (4) All other fees relate to professional services not included in the categories above, including services related to other permissible advisory services and regulatory reporting requirements. Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Registered&nbsp;Public Accounting Firm Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services for Apple, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services expected to be performed each year by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for other permissible non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit Committee. In accordance with this policy, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm in 2021.

We believe that the compensation of our named executive officers is commensurate with Apple&#146;s size, performance and profitability, the significant scope of their roles and responsibilities, and their strong values-driven leadership. We encourage shareholders to read the section entitled &#147;Compensation Discussion and Analysis,&#148; beginning on page 36, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2021. &nbsp; At the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, 95% of votes cast supported our executive compensation program. We also have ongoing discussions with many of our shareholders regarding various topics, including company performance and strategy, corporate governance, executive compensation, and environmental, social, and governance topics. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider shareholder feedback and the results of say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions. &nbsp; Shareholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;3 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No.&nbsp;3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC&#146;s executive compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables, is hereby approved. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on Apple, the Board, or the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding named executive officers. &nbsp; It is expected that the next say-on-pay vote will occur at the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; 64 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Proposal No.&nbsp;4 Approval of the Apple Inc. 2022&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;Stock Plan &nbsp; At the Annual Meeting, shareholders are being asked to approve the Apple&nbsp;Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the &#147;2022 Plan&#148;), which was approved by the Board on November&nbsp;9, 2021, subject to shareholder approval. The 2022 Plan is intended to continue our long-term equity compensation program, currently implemented under the Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the &#147;2014 Plan&#148;). If our shareholders approve the 2022 Plan, the 2022 Plan will replace the 2014 Plan and no further grants will be made under the 2014 Plan after the 2022 Plan is registered on Form S-8. The material features of the 2022 Plan are summarized below. The plan is included in its entirety as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. &nbsp; The 2014 Plan is our only active employee equity incentive plan (excluding our employee stock purchase plan). We also maintain our Director Stock Plan, as our non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in our 2014 Plan (or the 2022 Plan). As of September&nbsp;25, 2021, the last day of the 2021 fiscal year, the following awards were outstanding under our 2014 Plan and all of the other plans available to employees we have previously maintained: (i)&nbsp;options with respect to 298,709 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $5.35 and a weighted average remaining term of 1.57 years and (ii)&nbsp;unvested full-value awards covering 240,413,436 shares. &nbsp; In reviewing our historical grant practices, we determined that, excluding the effect of our share counting rules, we have issued approximately, 471,859,000 shares under our employee equity incentive plans over the last three fiscal years. The table below summarizes our equity grant practices during the most recent three fiscal years. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No. 4 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The&nbsp;Board recommends&nbsp;a vote&nbsp;FOR Proposal&nbsp;No.&nbsp;4. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fiscal Year &nbsp; Basic&nbsp;Weighted Average&nbsp;Shares Outstanding &nbsp; RSU &nbsp;&nbsp;Awards&nbsp;Granted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stock&nbsp;Options Granted &nbsp; &nbsp; Annualized&nbsp;Burn Rate (1) &nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; 18,471,336,000 &nbsp; 147,409,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.0% &nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; 17,352,119,000 &nbsp; 156,800,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.26% &nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; 16,701,272,000 &nbsp; 89,363,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.34% &nbsp; &nbsp; (1)&#8194;&#8201;&#8202;Burn rate is calculated as of the last day of each fiscal year using a 2.5:1 ratio for each type of award. &#147;Burn rate&#148; is the number of shares underlying equity awards granted to employees in a fiscal year, divided by basic weighted average ordinary shares outstanding that fiscal year. &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 65 As of September&nbsp;25, 2021, our overhang was 5.7%, and our burn rate in 2021 was 1.34%. Assuming our shareholders approve the 2022 Plan, our overhang will be 8.4%. For this purpose, &#147;overhang&#148; is defined as (A)&nbsp;the number of shares subject to awards granted to employees, plus (B)&nbsp;shares available for future grants, divided by the sum of shares outstanding plus the amounts described in clauses (A)&nbsp;and (B). The overhang calculation excludes shares available for future issuance or grant under our employee stock purchase plan or our Director Stock Plan, including shares subject to outstanding awards. Based on a review of our historical and projected grant practices, we estimate that the shares reserved for grant under the 2022 Plan should meet Apple&#146;s equity grant needs for approximately three years. The shares reserved may, however, last for more or less than three years depending on currently unknown factors, such as the number of grant recipients, future grant practices, and Apple&#146;s stock price. Description of the 2022 Plan The following is a summary of the principal features of the 2022 Plan. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the 2022 Plan. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2022 Plan which is included in its entirety as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. Share Reserve Maximum Share Reserve . The maximum number of shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2022 Plan is equal to the sum of: (i) 510 million shares, (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares available for new award grants under the 2014 Plan on the date that the shareholders approve the 2022 Plan (the &#147;Approval Date&#148;); (iii) the number of shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan that are outstanding as of the Approval Date which expire or terminate after the Approval Date; and (iv)&nbsp;two times the number of shares subject to RSUs or restricted awards granted under the 2014 Plan that are outstanding as of the Approval Date that are forfeited or terminated or with respect to which shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations after the Approval Date. However, in no event will the number of shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan exceed 1,274,374,682 shares. The number of shares described in this paragraph are subject to adjustment in the event of certain capitalization events. Unless the Compensation Committee provides otherwise, no fractional shares will be issued under the 2022 Plan. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine whether fractional shares will be rounded down or a cash payment will be made in lieu of fractional shares. Shares issued with respect to full-value awards (RSU or restricted stock awards) granted under the 2022 Plan are counted against the 2022 Plan&#146;s aggregate share limit as two shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the full-value award. For example, if 100 shares are issued with respect to an RSU award granted under the 2022 Plan, 200 shares will be counted against the 2022 Plan&#146;s aggregate share limit in connection with that award. Other Share Counting Rules. The following are other rules for counting shares against the applicable share limits of the 2022 Plan: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; For awards settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. Table of Contents &nbsp; 66 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; For shares that are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option, the number of underlying shares to which the exercise related shall be counted against the applicable share limits, as opposed to the number of shares actually issued. For example, if a stock option relates to 1,000 shares and is exercised in full on a cashless basis at a time when the payment due to the participant is 150 shares, then the 1,000 shares for which the option was exercised shall be charged against the applicable share limits. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Except as otherwise provided below, shares that are subject to awards that expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under either the 2014 Plan or the 2022 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2022 Plan. Any such shares subject to awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under either the 2014 Plan or the 2022 Plan will become available taking into account the 2:1 premium share counting rule applicable at the time of granting these types of awards. For example, if a 100 share RSU award made under the 2014 Plan or the 2022 Plan is forfeited before it vests, then 200 shares would again be available for subsequent awards under the 2022 Plan. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by Apple as full or partial payment in connection with any award other than an option or stock appreciation right granted under either the 2014 Plan or the 2022 Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld to satisfy the tax-related items (as defined in the 2022 Plan) arising in connection with any such award, will be available for subsequent awards under the 2022 Plan. Any such shares will become available taking into account the 2:1 premium share counting rule, discussed above, for these types of awards. For example, given that a 100 share RSU award made under either the 2014 Plan or the 2022 Plan counted as 200 shares against such plan&#146;s share limit because of the 2:1 premium share counting rule, if we deliver 60 shares to the participant and withhold 40 shares to cover tax withholding obligations, 80 shares (the 40 that were withheld multiplied by two to give effect to the 2:1 premium share counting rule) would again be available for subsequent awards under the 2022 Plan. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by Apple to pay the exercise price of an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2022 Plan, as well as any shares exchanged or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any option or stock appreciation right, will not be available for subsequent awards under the 2022 Plan. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Shares issued in connection with awards that are granted by or become obligations of Apple through the assumption of, or in substitution for, awards in connection with an acquisition of another company will not count against the shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan unless determined otherwise by Apple, and such awards may reflect the original terms of the related award being assumed or substituted for and need not comply with other specific terms of the 2022 Plan. Individual Award Limits No participant may be granted options or stock appreciation rights during any fiscal year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 7,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment in the event of certain capitalization events. In addition, no participant may be granted stock grants or restricted stock units during any fiscal year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 7,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment in the event of certain capitalization events.

Eligibility and Types of Awards Under the 2022 Plan The 2022 Plan permits the granting by the Compensation Committee of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants and RSUs. Stock appreciation rights may be awarded in combination with stock options or stock grants, and such awards shall provide that the stock appreciation rights will not be exercisable unless the related stock options or stock grants are forfeited. Employees and consultants of Apple and any parent or subsidiary of Apple are eligible to participate in the 2022 Plan. Employees include our executive officers and directors whom are employees. Non-Employee Directors are not eligible to participate. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had approximately 154,000 full-time equivalent employees, including executive officers, who would be eligible to participate in the 2022 Plan. Historically, we have not granted equity awards to consultants and do not have current plans to grant to consultants. RSUs The Compensation Committee may grant RSUs under the 2022 Plan. Participants are not required to pay any consideration to Apple at the time of grant of an RSU. The Compensation Committee may grant RSUs with time-based vesting or vesting upon satisfaction of performance goals and other conditions. The Compensation Committee may provide for dividend equivalent rights on RSUs awarded under the 2022 Plan based on the amount of dividends paid on outstanding shares of our common stock. Any dividend equivalent rights that are awarded will be subject to forfeiture and termination to the same extent as the corresponding RSUs to which the dividend equivalent rights relate. When a participant satisfies the conditions of an RSU award, we may settle the award (including any related dividend equivalent rights) in shares, cash or any combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. Performance-Based Awards Awards under the 2022 Plan may be made subject to performance conditions as well as time-vesting conditions. Performance conditions under the 2022 Plan may utilize one or more measurable performance goals as determined by the Compensation Committee, including one or more of the following criteria: (i)&nbsp;operating income; (ii)&nbsp;earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (iii)&nbsp;earnings; (iv) cash flow; (v)&nbsp;market share; (vi)&nbsp;sales or revenue; (vii)&nbsp;expenses; (viii) cost of goods sold; (ix)&nbsp;profit/loss or profit margin; (x)&nbsp;working capital; (xi)&nbsp;return on equity or assets; (xii)&nbsp;earnings per share; (xiii)&nbsp;total shareholder return; (xiv)&nbsp;price/earnings ratio; (xv)&nbsp;debt or debt-to-equity; (xvi)&nbsp;accounts receivable; (xvii)&nbsp;writeoffs; (xviii) cash; (xix)&nbsp;assets; (xx) liquidity; (xxi)&nbsp;operations; (xxii) intellectual property (e.g., patents); (xxiii) product development; (xxiv)&nbsp;manufacturing, production or inventory; (xxv)&nbsp;mergers and acquisitions or divestitures; (xxvi)&nbsp;Apple values, key community initiatives or other environmental, social or governance objectives, (xxvii)&nbsp;stock price, or (xviii)&nbsp;any other performance objective selected by the Compensation Committee. Any criteria used may be measured, as applicable, (a)&nbsp;in absolute terms, (b)&nbsp;in relative terms (including the passage of time or against other companies or financial metrics), (c) on a per Table of Contents &nbsp; 68 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; share or share per capita basis, (d)&nbsp;against the performance of Apple as a whole or against particular entities, segments, operating units or products or (e)&nbsp;on a pre-tax or after tax basis. Stock Options The Compensation Committee may grant nonstatutory stock options or incentive stock options, which are entitled to potentially favorable tax treatment, under the 2022 Plan. The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting schedule and number of shares covered by each stock option granted to a participant. The Compensation Committee may grant stock options with time-based vesting or vesting upon satisfaction of performance goals or other conditions. The stock option exercise price is determined at grant by the Compensation Committee and must be at least 100% of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant (110% for incentive stock options granted to shareholders who own more than 10% of the total outstanding shares of Apple, its parent or any of its subsidiaries). As of January 4, 2022, the closing price of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq was $179.70. Consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules, payment of the exercise price of stock options may be made by cashless exercise or by any other form of payment approved by the Compensation Committee. The term of a stock option shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Dividend equivalents may not be granted on stock options awarded under the 2022 Plan. Stock Grants The Compensation Committee may award stock grants, which may be subject to vesting conditions, under the 2022 Plan. Participants may be required to pay cash or other legal consideration to Apple at the time of a stock grant, but the 2022 Plan does not establish a minimum purchase price for shares awarded as stock grants. The Compensation Committee may award stock grants with time-based vesting or vesting upon satisfaction of performance goals or other conditions. Dividends paid on unvested stock grants will be subject to forfeiture or repayment, as the case may be, if the vesting condition applicable to the stock grant is not satisfied. Stock Appreciation Rights The Compensation Committee may grant stock appreciation rights under the 2022 Plan. The vesting schedule and number of shares covered by each stock appreciation right granted to a participant will be determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may grant stock appreciation rights with time-based vesting, or vesting upon satisfaction of performance goals, or other conditions. The exercise price of a stock appreciation right will be established by the Compensation Committee and may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant. Upon exercise of a stock appreciation right, the participant will receive payment from Apple in an amount determined by multiplying (a)&nbsp;the excess of (i)&nbsp;the fair market value of a share on the date of exercise over (ii)&nbsp;the exercise price times (b)&nbsp;the number of shares with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. Stock appreciation rights may be paid in cash, shares, or any combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, at the time of grant. The term of a stock appreciation right shall not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. Dividend equivalent rights may not be granted on stock appreciation rights awarded under the 2022 Plan.

Transferability of Awards Except as described below, awards under the 2022 Plan generally are not transferable by the recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and stock options and stock appreciation rights are generally exercisable, during the recipient&#146;s lifetime, only by the recipient. Any amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to an award generally will be paid only to the recipient or the recipient&#146;s beneficiary or representative. The Compensation Committee has discretion, however, to establish written conditions and procedures for the transfer of awards to other persons or entities, provided that such transfers comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and are not made for value, other than nominal value or certain transfers to family members. Change of Control Generally, upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the 2022 Plan), all awards then-outstanding under the 2022 Plan will terminate, unless the Compensation Committee provides for the cash settlement, assumption, substitution, or other continuation of the award, provided that the holders of options and stock appreciation rights will be given an opportunity to exercise their vested awards prior to the termination of the awards. Corporate Actions The existence of the 2022 Plan does not preclude Apple, the Board or any duly authorized committee of the Board from taking any action that may otherwise be taken in accordance with applicable law or any applicable listing requirements, including paying compensation outside the parameters of the 2022 Plan. Adjustments As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the 2022 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase prices of&nbsp;awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, including a change of control of&nbsp;Apple, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or Table of Contents &nbsp; 70 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the shareholders, to the extent necessary to preserve the level or economic value of incentives intended by the 2022 Plan and outstanding awards. Amendment and Termination The Board may amend the 2022 Plan at any time and for any reason, provided that any such amendment will be subject to shareholder approval to the extent required by applicable laws, regulations, or rules. The Board may terminate the 2022 Plan at any time and for any reason. Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the 2022 Plan will terminate on November&nbsp;8, 2031, subject to any extension that may be approved by the Board and the shareholders prior to or on such date. The termination or amendment of the 2022 Plan may not adversely affect any award previously made under the 2022 Plan except that any amendments the Compensation Committee determines are necessary or desirable to facilitate compliance with applicable law may be made without the participant&#146;s written consent. Recoupment Policy Awards granted under the 2022 Plan will be subject to any provisions of applicable law providing for the recoupment or clawback of incentive compensation, such as provisions imposed pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; the terms of any Apple recoupment, clawback or similar policy in effect at the time of grant of the award; and any recoupment, clawback or similar provisions that may be included in the applicable award agreement. Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a brief summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to awards granted under the 2022 Plan based on the federal income tax laws in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters relevant to a particular participant based on their specific circumstances. The summary expressly does not discuss the income tax laws of any state, municipality, or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction, or the gift, estate, excise (including the rules applicable to deferred compensation under Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code), or other tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax law. The following is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties. Because individual circumstances may vary, we advise all participants to consult their own tax advisor concerning the tax implications of awards granted under the 2022 Plan. A recipient of a stock option or stock appreciation right will not have taxable income upon the grant of the stock option or stock appreciation right. For nonstatutory stock options and stock appreciation rights, the participant will recognize ordinary income upon exercise in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the exercise price on the date of exercise. Any gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares generally will be a capital gain or loss. The acquisition of shares upon exercise of an incentive stock option will not result in any taxable income to the participant, except possibly for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. The gain or loss recognized by the participant on a later sale or other disposition of such shares will either be long-term Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 71 capital gain or loss or ordinary income, depending upon whether the participant holds the shares for the legally-required period of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise. If the shares are not held for the legally-required period, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price, or (ii)&nbsp;the difference between the sales price and the exercise price. For awards of stock grants, the participant will not have taxable income upon the receipt of the award, unless the participant elects to be taxed at the time of the stock is granted rather than when it becomes vested. The stock grants will generally be subject to tax upon vesting as ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of vesting less the amount paid for such shares, if any. A participant is not deemed to receive any taxable income at the time an award of RSUs is granted. When vested RSUs (and dividend equivalents, if any) are settled and distributed, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash or the fair market value of shares received less the amount paid for such RSUs, if any. If the participant is an employee or former employee, the amount a participant recognizes as ordinary income in connection with any award is subject to tax-related items (not applicable to incentive stock options) and we are allowed a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. Future Plan Benefits As of the date of this Proxy Statement, no awards have been granted under the 2022 Plan. Awards under the 2022 Plan may be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and any awards that may be made and any benefits and amounts that may be received or allocated under the 2022 Plan in the future are not determinable at this time. As such, the future plan benefits, as well as information regarding the number of awards that may be received under the 2022 Plan in the future, have been omitted. Table of Contents &nbsp; 72 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Proposal No.&nbsp;5 Shareholder Proposal Reincorporate with Deeper Purpose &nbsp; &nbsp; RESOLVED: Shareholders request our Board of Directors take steps necessary to amend our articles of incorporation and, if necessary, bylaws (including presenting such amendments to shareholders for approval) to become a Social Purpose Corporation and to adopt specific social purposes such as (A) benefitting (1) the corporation&#146;s employees, suppliers, customers, and creditors; (2) the community and society; and (3) the environment and (B) exercising reasonable care to ensure that the Company&#146;s operations do not impose social and environmental costs that materially contribute to the degradation or destruction of important social and environmental systems. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Apple&#146;s CEO Tim Cook signed the Business Roundtable Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation (the &#147;Statement&#148;). 1 We applaud the Statement, which proclaims &#147;we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders.... We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.&#148; However, Apple incorporated with an uninspiring purpose: &#147;The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of California...&#148; Rechartering around deeper social purposes would help Apple align all actions around common goals. It would motivate shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders, guiding our Company on a more inspiring mission than engaging &#147;in any lawful act or activity.&#148; Purpose is the most distilled form of strategy. It clarifies how a corporation should spend its time and resources. It aligns all actions around a common goal. And it motivates all stakeholders through a mission that is more inspiring than profit maximization. 2 Our employees are striving to address issues such as climate risk, wealth inequality, diversity, equity, and inclusion. We should identify employee values through Slack 3 or other channels and adopt specific social purposes in better alignment. Apple should also explore policies and practices to embed and amplify worker voice inside corporate decision-making and accountability systems. 4 &#147;Millennial employees, consumers, and investors will fact check claims and callout companies that fail to live up to their own rhetoric, often with significant economic consequences.&#148; 5 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/BRT-StatementonthePurposeofaCorporationOctober2020.pdf 2 &nbsp; https://www.harpercollins.com/products/accountable-michael-olearywarren-valdmanis?variant=32127314755618 3 &nbsp; https://www.theverge.com/22659497/apple-slack-organizing-zoe-schiffer-decoder-interview 4 &nbsp; https://www.aspeninstitute.org/our-people/ 5 &nbsp; https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918443 Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 73 A recent study determined that listed companies create annual social and environmental costs of $2.2 trillion. These costs have many sources, including pollution, climate change and employee stress. 6 Being guided by a legally adopted North Star would likely lead Apple to further reduce externalized costs and even more fully engage stakeholders. By adopting specific social purposes our stakeholders will know Apple&#146;s values are built into Apple&#146;s very reason for existing. Those social purposes would not be seen as public relations statements that can be changed according to the latest fad. Our social purposes will be our North Star, guiding and engaging stakeholders on a path to a better future. Please vote for: Reincorporate with Deeper Purpose&#150;Proposal 5 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; https://www.schroders.com/en/sysglobalassets/digital/insights/2019/pdfs/sustainability/sustainex/sustainex-short.pdf Table of Contents &nbsp; 74 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&nbsp;5 &nbsp; Apple has a demonstrated record of considering the interests of a wide range of stakeholders, including our customers, communities, and the environment we all share, while seeking to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. The change in corporate form requested by this proposal is unnecessary and would entail potential risks and costs. &nbsp; At Apple, we are committed to demonstrating that business can and should be a force for good. A commitment to all of our stakeholders lies at the heart of Apple&#146;s long-standing values of accessibility, education, environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy, and supplier responsibility, and reflects how management operates our company, consistent with our corporate purpose. Accordingly, we believe converting Apple to a new corporate form would not meaningfully change how we operate our company or best serve the interests of our shareholders or other stakeholders. &nbsp; Shareholders and other stakeholders can learn about how Apple conducts its business through various reports that we make publicly available, including our reports on Environmental Progress, People and Environment&nbsp;in Our Supply Chain, and Privacy Transparency, which detail our commitments, programs, and progress on these matters. In 2021, Apple extended its commitment to transparency with enhanced reporting, by introducing Apple&#146;s first Environment, Social, and Governance Report, which seeks to provide a broad view of our environmental, social, and governance efforts across Apple. &nbsp; The California Social Purpose Corporation model selected in this proposal by the proponent is a relatively new creation and is largely untested, particularly for a company of our size and complexity. It is extremely difficult at this time to predict the impact on our shareholders and our long-term success of changing our corporate form, but we believe such a change would entail potential risks and costs. &nbsp; Our proven record and unwavering commitment to our stakeholders, our communities and our values demonstrate that Apple in its current corporate form is able to consider the interests of a wide range of stakeholders, including our customers, communities, and the environment we all share, while seeking to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. &nbsp; We therefore believe it is unnecessary to change our corporate form in order to continue leading with our values in the technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we share. &nbsp; For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 5 . &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;5 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 75 Proposal No.&nbsp;6 Shareholder Proposal Transparency Reports In December 2020, 154 human rights organizations wrote to CEO Tim Cook regarding Apple&#146;s complicity with the Chinese government&#146;s human rights atrocities, noting that &#147;[e]ven though...app removals gravely affect freedom of expression and access to information, Apple&#146;s Transparency Report currently does not disclose such actions beyond a number.&#148; The New York Times reported in May 2021: &#147;... Apple has constructed a bureaucracy that has become a powerful tool in China&#146;s vast censorship operation. It proactively censors its Chinese App Store, relying on software and employees to flag and block apps that Apple managers worry could run afoul of Chinese officials.&#148; Since 2017, the Times said, roughly 55,000 active apps have disappeared from Apple&#146;s Chinese App Store, including &#147;tools for organizing pro-democracy protests and skirting internet restrictions.&#148; Most of those apps have remained available in other countries, the Times said. Apple&#146;s transparency report for the first half of 2020 disclosed that it complied with all 46 requests from the Chinese government to remove 152 apps from the App Store. The report did not explain which apps were removed or for what reason. &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Apple&#146;s transparency reporting takes a &#147;quantitative approach&#148; that offers &#147;little context for the app removal requests from the Chinese government or explanation of the risks that may be involved,&#148; according to Institutional Shareholder Services. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The 2020 Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index found &#147;Apple lacked transparency about its process for removing apps from the App Store for violations to iOS rules.&#148; &nbsp; Shareholders are deeply concerned about a material failure in Apple&#146;s transparency reporting that seemingly highlights a contradiction between Apple&#146;s human rights policy and its actions regarding China and its occupied territories, which represent almost a third of Apple&#146;s customer base. This poses significant legal, reputational, and financial risk to Apple and its shareholders. Resolved, shareholders request the Board of Directors revise the Company&#146;s Transparency Reports to provide clear explanations of the number and categories of app removals from the app store, in response to or in anticipation of government requests, that may reasonably be expected to limit freedom of expression or access to information. Such revision may exclude proprietary or legally privileged information. Supporting Statement: Proponents suggest the company include in its Transparency Reports, or explain why it cannot disclose: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The substantive content of government requests, by country, including which government agencies made requests; number of apps removed by category such as &#147;encrypted communications,&#148; VPN, etc.; and external legal or policy basis as well as internal company criteria on which the apps were removed; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Any indicia of the extent of impact on residents of those countries, such as the number of prior downloads of the app and whether existing usage of the app was eliminated; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Any efforts by the company to mitigate the harmful effect on freedom of expression and access to information posed by the categories of removals. &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; 76 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No. 6 &nbsp; Apple makes products that unleash creativity, that enable communication and sharing across borders, and that open pathways to innovation, collaboration, and entrepreneurship. Apple already provides detailed information regarding government requests to remove apps from the App Store. The additional report requested by this proposal is unnecessary based on the extensive information that is already publicly provided to our users and stakeholders, our existing policies, and active Board oversight. &nbsp; Transparent reporting . We are committed to the privacy of our users and being transparent about government app removal requests globally. We publish a bi-annual Transparency Report, 1 where we provide comprehensive information on government requests received, including extensive disclosures on government app removal requests. The Transparency Report discloses, by country or region, the app removal request type; the number of requests received; the number of apps specified in the request; the number of requests objected to in part or rejected in full; the number of requests that resulted in an app being removed; the number of apps removed; the number of appeals received; the number of appeals granted; and the number of apps reinstated. &nbsp; Apple describes the kinds of content on the apps that governments in each country or region sought to remove. For example, the &#147;Matters of Note&#148; section of the Transparency Report explains that certain of the removed apps were gambling apps, or that a government sought to remove certain apps because they were identified as state security violations. These qualitative descriptions provide insight as to the types of content that governments in each country or region prohibit, and readers can discern from these descriptions whether the apps at issue relate to freedom of expression or access to information. Apple periodically reviews the type of information disclosed in the Transparency Report and modifies its content as appropriate to enhance transparency for our users and our stakeholders. &nbsp; In addition to the information in the Transparency Report, we provide specific notice directly to the affected developer when an app is removed from the App Store, and the developer can appeal the removal if they believe it was made in error. In the case of a government request to remove an app from the App Store, Apple has established a procedure so that the notice to the developer includes details regarding the legal authority making the request and the legal basis that the authority cites for doing so. This notice and appeal procedure is also publicly disclosed on &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;6 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The&nbsp;Board recommends&nbsp;a vote&nbsp;AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;6. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/transparency/ Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 77 our website for developers. 2 Even more information about the App Store is available at apple.com/app-store, where customers and developers can learn more about how Apple manages the App Store to make it a safe and trusted place to discover and download apps. App Store policies . The guiding principle of the App Store is simple&#151;we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by offering a highly curated App Store where every app is reviewed by experts, and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. For everything else, there is always the open Internet and web browser apps to reach all users outside of the App Store. As stated in Apple&#146;s Human Rights Policy&#151;Our Commitment to Human Rights, 3 and in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Apple acknowledges that we have a responsibility to respect internationally recognized human rights and also comply with laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. At times, local law may require us to limit the availability of a particular app in the App Store. In such cases, the government demanding removal of the app must present a basis in law, such as a statutory or regulatory requirement, or a valid court order. We make clear on our Transparency Report website that &#147;[i]f a request does not have a valid legal basis, or if we consider it to be unclear, inappropriate, or overly broad, we challenge or reject the request.&#148; 4 And, while we may disagree with certain decisions at times, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of our users to simply abandon markets, which would leave consumers with fewer choices and fewer privacy protections. Instead, we prioritize engagement, advocating for the outcome we believe is in the best interests of our users&#151;their privacy, their ability to express themselves, and their ability to access reliable information and helpful technology. We believe in seeking opportunities for engagement to advocate for policies and practices that are consistent with Apple&#146;s values and our commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights. All apps worldwide are screened for quality and illegal or harmful content. As part of the review process, Apple makes a good faith effort to ensure illegal content does not end up on a country&#146;s storefront. For example, in certain jurisdictions, gambling apps may be illegal or require a license to operate, and our teams seek to screen apps proposing to operate in violation of local law or without a valid license. Apple does not &#147;proactively censor&#148; apps, as suggested in the proposal, but rather abides by the laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates, as all companies operating in such jurisdictions must do. An app removed from an App Store in a jurisdiction where it is prohibited would remain available in other jurisdictions where the developer has made it available so long as it is not in violation of our App Store Guidelines or applicable local law in those other jurisdictions. Board oversight . Apple&#146;s Board plays a vital and important role overseeing this work. In 2020, our Board adopted Apple&#146;s Human Rights Policy on behalf of the company. Our General Counsel oversees implementation of the policy and reports to the Board and its committees on progress and any significant issues identified in the diligence process. Our Audit Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, also assists the Board in monitoring our significant business risks, including operational and reputational exposures that may relate to compliance with governmental laws, regulations, and orders. &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; developer.apple.com/support/app-store/ 3 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/docs/human-rights-policy 4 &nbsp; apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests Table of Contents &nbsp; 78 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; As described above, Apple already provides detailed information in our Transparency Report and elsewhere regarding our treatment of various types of app removal requests and the kinds of content on the apps that governments sought to remove, including requests that may limit freedom of expression or access to information. Apple therefore believes that the additional report requested by this proposal is unnecessary based on the extensive information that is already publicly provided to our users and stakeholders, our existing policies, and active Board oversight. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 6 .

(&#147;Apple&#148;) ask the Board of Directors to oversee the preparation of a report, at reasonable cost and omitting confidential and proprietary information, on the extent to which Apple&#146;s policies and procedures effectively protect workers in its supply chain from forced labor, including the extent to which Apple has identified suppliers and sub-suppliers that are at significant risk for forced labor violations, the number of suppliers against which Apple has taken corrective action due to such violations, and the availability and use of grievance mechanisms to compensate affected workers. The report should be posted to Apple&#146;s website. SUPPORTING STATEMENT Apple relies on over 200 suppliers 1 globally for product components. These suppliers and sub-suppliers may be at significant risk for forced labor if they have facilities in areas with a high risk of forced labor, or source inputs from such areas. Apple&#146;s Code of Conduct (2005)&nbsp;lists forced labor as a &#145;core violation&#146; of its policy, with suppliers required to &#145;ensure that all work is voluntary&#146; and prohibited from &#145;traffic[king] persons or us[ing] any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or prison labor.&#146; The Code also states suppliers must undertake due diligence and allow Apple access to their facilities to evaluate suppliers and sub-suppliers&#146; compliance. 2 Apple&#146;s Human Rights Policy (2020)&nbsp;states its desire &#145;to be a force for good in the lives of people in our supply chain&#146;, and asserts that Apple works &#145;hand in hand with our suppliers to ensure that every workplace provides a safe and respectful environment for everyone&#146;. 3 It has been reported that at least nine 4 companies in Apple&#146;s supply chain participate in the government of China&#146;s forced labor program. Reports suggest that Apple severed ties with Ofilm Group over allegations that it&#146;s involved in that program.

We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal. &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; https://mcgovern.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398673 Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 81 Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&nbsp;7 &nbsp; Zero tolerance for forced labor . At Apple, people come first in everything we do. Our respect for human rights includes our commitment to ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect across our worldwide supply chain. Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor, and looking for the presence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment we conduct. &nbsp; We uphold the highest standards in the industry. The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct, Apple Supplier Responsibility Standards, and Apple Human Rights Policy outline our requirements for suppliers in the areas of labor and human rights, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. We continuously review our suppliers to verify that they can meet or exceed our strict standards and provide training and toolkits to help them better understand how to meet these standards if needed. As part of these reviews, independent, third-party assessments are conducted at supplier facilities, which verify key employee documentation, investigate hiring practices, and conduct extensive interviews with workers in their native languages and without their managers present. We conduct supplier assessments, including surprise assessments, in the 53 countries across our supply chain. The protections apply across the supply chain, regardless of a person&#146;s job or location. Any violation of our policies has immediate consequences, including possible business termination. &nbsp; In 2020, Apple and our independent third-party auditors conducted 1,121 assessments of our suppliers around the world. In addition, we interviewed more than 57,000 workers and undertook anonymous surveys of a further 196,000 workers across 135 facilities in their native languages to ensure we understand their experiences. Throughout this we found no evidence of forced labor anywhere in our worldwide supply chain. This proposal cites media reports alleging incidents of forced labor in global supply chains and references nine suppliers. Between April 2020 and December 2021, we audited each of these nine suppliers with a total of 23 audits among the companies, including 10 unannounced audits, and we did not find any evidence of forced labor on any Apple production lines. Apple also conducted extensive due diligence, and despite restrictions due to COVID-19, we were able to dispatch independent, third-party investigators to these supplier facilities. The teams verified key documentation, investigated hiring practices, and interviewed over 2,300 randomly-selected workers in local languages across these sites and without their managers present. Interviewed workers are contacted after &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;7 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The&nbsp;Board recommends&nbsp;a vote&nbsp;AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;7. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; 82 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; the assessment to confirm that they have not experienced any retaliation as a result of speaking with auditors. Through this due diligence, we found no evidence of forced labor, and we continue our efforts to seek to ensure workers are treated with dignity and respect everywhere we operate. As part of our process for identifying potential new suppliers, we rigorously evaluate the risks, including labor and human rights risks, associated with prospective suppliers well before they begin working with Apple. We conduct Facility Readiness Assessments, which are thorough reviews designed to ensure that potential risks to people are fully rectified prior to the start of production. In 2020, we completed 112 Facility Readiness Assessments, and eight percent of prospective suppliers evaluated for these risks, including forced labor risks, were prevented from entering Apple&#146;s supply chain. Our standards often go beyond legal requirements. One example of this is by enforcing a zero recruitment fees policy, even in places where these fees, paid by supplier employees to secure a job, are legally permitted. In the event that we discover recruitment fees were paid by supplier employees, we require our suppliers to directly repay their employees in full. Since 2008, we have required suppliers to repay $32.4 million to 36,980 supplier employees. Apple has pioneered tools and training for our suppliers and the labor agents that recruit employees for them to address this issue at its roots, and we have openly shared the tools with companies across multiple industries. Protecting the people in our supply chain . We require our suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights. Since 2008, over 21.5&nbsp;million supplier employees have received training on their workplace rights under local labor laws and the human rights protections outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards. Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards also require feedback channels for workers, including grievance mechanisms at all supplier sites, and strict protection from retaliation for speaking up. This includes third-party anonymous hotlines and the ability to contact the Apple Environment and Supply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly at any time and in any language. When an issue is raised, Apple thoroughly investigates, and supplier management is required to resolve violations of our standards in a timely manner. Retaliation in any form is a Core Violation of the Supplier Code of Conduct and carries significant penalties. When a Core Violation is identified, the supplier&#146;s Chief Executive Officer is notified, and the supplier is placed on probation, which continues until Apple determines that the supplier has completed all corrective actions. In addition to addressing the specific Core Violation and the root causes of the violation, the supplier must take steps to strengthen their management systems and practices to prevent a reoccurrence of the issue. The possible consequences of probation include receiving no new projects, no new business, or the termination of existing business with Apple. To date, 24 suppliers have been removed from our supply chain due to Core Violations. We work collaboratively with a range of stakeholders, including governments, industry associations, and non-governmental organizations devoted to the promotion and respect of human rights. Every year we incorporate feedback from such stakeholders to help align our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards with current internationally recognized standards, including the International Labour Organization&#146;s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#146;s (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, as well as industry-leading health and safety standards. Our approach to conducting human rights due diligence in our supply chain is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We additionally engage with these stakeholders to openly share our tools and learnings with other companies in order to drive high Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 83 standards beyond our supply chain and effect progress more quickly. Apple also supports grassroots human rights defenders through partnerships with leading organizations, including by providing labor rights training and legal aid for victims of human rights abuses. Transparent reporting . Since 2007, Apple has publicly released reports that contain extensive information and disclosures about the extent to which our policies and procedures effectively protect workers in our supply chain. We have continually improved and expanded these reports over time, and they currently include the following series of reports that provide detailed, relevant, and comprehensive information for stakeholders, all available publicly on apple.com: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Our Commitment to Human Rights; 1 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Supplier Code of Conduct 2 and Supplier Responsibility Standards; 3 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance Report; 4 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 2021 People and Environment in Our Supply Chain; 5 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; How We Work with Suppliers Guide; 6 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 2020 Statement on Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery in Our Business and Supply Chain; 7 and &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 2020 Conflict Minerals Report. 8 Apple reports at least annually on the extent to which its policies and procedures effectively protect workers in its supply chain from forced labor. As reported in our 2020 Statement on Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery in Our Business and Supply Chain, there were no findings of forced labor in Apple&#146;s supply chain in 2020. Board oversight . In 2020, the Board adopted Apple&#146;s Human Rights Policy on behalf of the company. The policy governs how we treat everyone, including people at every level of our supply chain. Our General Counsel oversees implementation of our Human Rights Policy and reports to the Board and its committees on progress and any significant issues identified in the diligence process. In addition, our Audit Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, assists the Board in monitoring our significant business risks, including operational and reputational exposures that may relate to human rights issues. As described above, Apple has already publicly disclosed through a number of reports the extent to which our policies and procedures effectively protect workers in our supply chain from forced labor. Based on our existing policies, extensive auditing and rigorous oversight of suppliers, active Board oversight, and the comprehensive information that is already publicly provided to our shareholders and other stakeholders, Apple believes that the additional report requested by the proponent would be duplicative and unnecessary. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 7 . &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/docs/human-rights-policy 2 &nbsp; apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf 3 &nbsp; apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Supplier-Responsible-Standards.pdf 4 &nbsp; investor.apple.com/esg/2021_Apple_ESG_Report 5 &nbsp; apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple_SR_2021_Progress_Report.pdf 6 &nbsp; apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/How-We-Work-With-Suppliers.pdf 7 &nbsp; apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Combat-Human-Trafficking-and-Slavery-in-Supply-Chain-2020.pdf 8 &nbsp; apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Conflict-Minerals-Report.pdf Table of Contents &nbsp; 84 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Proposal No.&nbsp;8 Shareholder Proposal Pay Equity Whereas: Pay inequity persists across race and gender. Black workers&#146; hourly median earnings have fallen 3.6&nbsp;percent since 2000, representing 75.6&nbsp;percent of white wages. The median income for women working full time is 82&nbsp;percent that of men. Intersecting race, Black women make 63 cents, Native women 60 cents, and Latina women 55 cents. At the current rate, women will not reach pay equity until 2059, Black women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224. Citigroup estimates closing minority and gender wage gaps 20 years ago could have generated 12 trillion dollars in additional income and contributed 0.15&nbsp;percent to United States GDP annually. PwC estimates closing the gender pay gap could boost Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries&#146; economies by 2 trillion dollars annually. Actively managing pay equity is associated with improved representation, and diversity is linked to superior stock performance and return on equity. Of note, Black employees represent 9&nbsp;percent of Apple&#146;s workforce, but only 4&nbsp;percent of leadership. Women only account for 34&nbsp;percent of Apple&#146;s workforce and 31&nbsp;percent of leadership. Pay gaps are literally defined as the median pay of minorities compared to non-minorities and the median pay of women compared to men. They are considered the valid way of measuring gender pay inequity by the United States Census Bureau, Department of Labor, OECD, and International Labor Organization. Best practice pay equity reporting consists of two parts: 1. unadjust ed median pay gaps, assessing equal opportunity to high paying roles, 2.&nbsp;statistically adjusted gaps, assessing pay between minorities and non-minorities, men and women, performing similar roles. Apple has committed to statistically adjusted pay equity but ignores unadjusted median gaps, which address the structural bias women and underrepresented minorities face regarding job opportunity and pay. The Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission now mandates pay data reporting, across race and gender, as workforce diversity data alone is insufficient to assess pay inequity. The United Kingdom mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps and is considering race and ethnicity reporting. Apple reported a 7 percent median base pay gap and a 29 percent bonus gap for U.K. employees. Resolved: Shareholders request Apple report on median pay gaps across race and gender, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. Racial/gender pay gaps are defined as the difference between non-minority and minority/male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of non-minority/male earnings (Wikipedia/OECD, respectively). Supporting Statement: An annual report adequate for investors to assess performance could, with board discretion, integrate base, bonus and equity compensation to calculate: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; percentage median gender pay gap, globally and/or by country, where appropriate &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; percentage median racial/minority/ethnicity pay gap, US and/or by country, where appropriate Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 85 Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&nbsp;8 &nbsp; At Apple, we&#146;re building on our long-standing commitment to make our company more inclusive and diverse and ensure equitable pay for all employees. Apple already fulfills the report&#146;s objectives through our comprehensive approach to pay equity and representation, robust disclosure, and active Board oversight and therefore the report requested by this proposal is unnecessary. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;We have achieved gender pay equity globally since 2017, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States. We are also committed to closing any pay gap we find at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in our U.S. workforce. We report our results annually on our Inclusion and Diversity website. 1 &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Inclusion and diversity is one of our Apple values, and we hold our leaders accountable by incorporating our Apple values and key community initiatives into our executives&#146; annual cash incentive program. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8202;Our progress on representation is broad-based across the company, and at all levels. For example, the number of female employees in leadership roles at Apple has increased by 85&nbsp;percent between 2014 and 2020, and 37&nbsp;percent of open leadership roles were filled by women globally from January 2020 to December 2020. In the United States, between 2014 and 2020, the number of Black employees in leadership roles has increased 60&nbsp;percent, and the number of Hispanic/Latinx employees in leadership roles has increased 90 percent. Between January 2020 and December 2020, 43&nbsp;percent of leadership roles were filled by people from underrepresented communities in the United States. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;We do not ask candidates about their compensation history during the recruiting process to avoid perpetuating any pay inequity created by previous companies. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;We are transparent about our progress and have made EEO-1 reports publicly available since 2015. &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;We&#146;ve implemented programs designed to help our employees advance their careers in an inclusive environment, such as our Career Experiences program, as well as unconscious bias training for all employees. &nbsp; Promoting pay equity and representation . Apple has a firm and long-standing commitment to pay equity, and since 2017, we have achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States. In every country where we operate, employees of all genders earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance. These metrics are assessed by a third-party firm that evaluates compensation across all of Apple using statistical &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;8 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;8. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; apple.com/diversity/ Table of Contents &nbsp; 86 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; modeling. This rigorous review considers annual total compensation, including base salary, bonuses, and RSUs, as well as a variety of data related to pay, including job level, location, performance ratings, and tenure. We are also committed to closing any pay gap we find at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in our U.S. workforce. To help ensure internal equity, we target diverse interview panels and candidate slates so diversity is reflected at every stage of the hiring process. Moreover, to avoid perpetuating any pay inequity created by previous companies, we do not ask candidates for compensation history, and our recruiters develop offers of employment based on the compensation of current Apple employees in similar roles. During our annual compensation planning process, the People team uses analytics to assess promotion rates, performance ratings distribution, and pay metrics for women compared to men and, in the United States, for underrepresented groups compared to non-underrepresented groups. We also seek to pay a highly competitive minimum wage in the United States, and provide all employees opportunities for stock ownership in the company. We continue to focus on increasing diverse representation at every level of the company to help Apple become an even better reflection of the world we live in, and we are proud of the progress we&#146;ve made. As published on our website, between 2014 and 2020, the number of employees from underrepresented communities has increased by 64&nbsp;percent in the United States, and makes up nearly 50&nbsp;percent of Apple&#146;s U.S. workforce. The number of Hispanic/Latinx employees at Apple in the United States has grown by more than 80&nbsp;percent during this period, with a 90&nbsp;percent increase in leadership. The number of Black employees at Apple in the United States has grown by more than 50&nbsp;percent, with a 60&nbsp;percent increase in leadership, and the number of female employees at Apple worldwide has grown more than 70&nbsp;percent, with an 85&nbsp;percent increase in leadership during this time. Leadership roles include managers at all levels of our company. Transparent reporting . We share our progress on our Inclusion and Diversity website, 2 which provides data on the ratio of women and people from underrepresented communities in our workforce, as well as within tech, nontech, leadership, retail and retail leadership roles. We also share on our website metrics regarding hiring for leadership positions, R&amp;D positions, and R&amp;D leadership positions. Although we do not use the Federal Employer Information Report EEO-1 to assess progress, we are one of a small group of large companies making these reports publicly available, and have been doing so since 2015. Fostering an inclusive culture to promote representation . At Apple, we strive to create a collaborative culture of inclusion, growth, and originality, where all employees can thrive. From day one, Apple employees have access to our career development programs, ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and support throughout their career journey. For example, our Career Experiences program provides employees from our stores, retail customer care, and AppleCare teams the opportunity to spend time on a corporate career rotation. Participants build new skills, while host teams benefit from their team members&#146; new perspectives, talent, and passion. Participation has grown by over 30&nbsp;percent since it began in 2015, and in 2021, thousands of opportunities were offered across 80&nbsp;percent of our lines of business. Further, all our employees are required to complete unconscious bias and inclusion training, and can access expert-led courses on race, justice, allyship, and more. In addition, all our managers are required to take inclusive leadership training, and inclusion and diversity measures are built into our annual review process for leaders across Apple. For more than 30 years, Apple employees have found community and connection in our Diversity Network Associations (DNAs). These employee-led groups are rooted in the celebration and amplification of culturally underrepresented communities and are designed to engage and empower employees to connect with one another and to have a direct impact on the employee experience, our business, and the communities where we live and work, regardless of geography or job role. DNA memberships have doubled since the beginning &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; apple.com/diversity/ Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 87 of 2020, and today, over 47,000 Apple employees across the globe belong to groups like Familia@Apple, the Apple Asian Association, the Apple Indian Association, Black@Apple, Indigenous@Apple, Pride@Apple, and Women@Apple, and a range of faith-based and cultural groups. Empowering communities. We are also committed to supporting and empowering communities around the world. In June 2020, Apple launched the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), a long-term effort to help ensure more positive outcomes for communities of color across the country and help foster the next generation of inclusive leaders. We&#146;ve committed $130&nbsp;million to focus on three key areas: education, criminal justice, and economic empowerment. Apple is also collaborating with minority-serving institutions across the country to support the leadership of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and community colleges and other centers of learning in expanding educational access. We are partnering with stakeholders to support the Propel Center, resourcing preeminent organizations working to end mass incarceration and racial injustice. We are also providing mentorship to founders who have historically been cut out of funding opportunities through our Impact Accelerator and significant financial investments to support businesses with diverse founders. In addition, our Apple Developer Academy, which first opened in Brazil in 2013, provides the tools and training for aspiring entrepreneurs, developers, and designers to find and create jobs in the thriving iOS app economy. Apple has now established more than a dozen academies across the world, including the first in the United States which has recently opened in Detroit, Michigan. Effective oversight . Inclusion and diversity is one of our Apple values, and we have a dedicated Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity working to develop and retain the world-class talent, at all levels, that reflects the communities we serve. In addition, we hold our leaders accountable by incorporating our Apple values and key community initiatives into our executives&#146; annual cash incentive program through an ESG Modifier. The inclusion of the ESG Modifier in our executives&#146; annual cash incentive program reflects our commitment to promoting values-driven leadership. In addition, as part of the Board&#146;s oversight of corporate and product strategy, the Board and its committees also review and discuss with management Apple&#146;s strategies and progress relating to these values, including updates from our Vice President of Inclusion and Diversity. Overall, we take a comprehensive approach to pay equity and representation, from our compensation planning processes designed to further equitable pay and representation to the internal policies and programs we&#146;ve implemented to foster career growth, diversity, and inclusion. We believe that our methodology represents a more fulsome and effective approach to pay equity and representation than that set forth in the proposal, and we are proud of the progress we&#146;ve achieved under our current framework. The unadjusted median pay gap measure requested in the proposal would only provide a comparison of two employees who share a particular gender, racial, or ethnic characteristic, but would not factor in the employee&#146;s role, skills, performance, experience, tenure, or location, and therefore would not provide an accurate measurement of whether such employees are being fairly paid. Moreover, we already provide the percentage representation of women and people from underrepresented communities in leadership roles at Apple, and therefore the median ratio requested in the proposal would not provide meaningful supplemental information. We understand that single median pay gap figures may be helpful to jumpstart dialogue and processes at companies that have less mature frameworks in place or whose efforts have proven unproductive. However, given the maturity and robust quality of our internal processes and programs, our demonstrated progress and proven commitment to pay equity, and active Board oversight, we believe our current framework is more appropriate for Apple at this time. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 8 . Table of Contents &nbsp; 88 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Proposal No.&nbsp;9 Shareholder Proposal Civil Rights Audit RESOLVED that shareholders of Apple Inc. (&#147;Apple&#148;) urge the Board of Directors to oversee a third-party audit analyzing the adverse impact of Apple&#146;s policies and practices on the civil rights of company stakeholders, above and beyond legal and regulatory matters, and to provide recommendations for improving the company&#146;s civil rights impact. Input from civil rights organizations, employees, and customers should be considered in determining the specific matters to be analyzed. A report on the audit, prepared at reasonable cost and omitting confidential or proprietary information, should be publicly disclosed on Apple&#146;s website. SUPPORTING STATEMENT Recently, the racial justice movement together with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused the public&#146;s and policy makers&#146; attention on civil rights and gender and racial equity issues. Apple lists diversity, inclusion, and accessibility among its key values. It committed $100&nbsp;million to a new racial justice initiative following the racial justice protests in 2020. The company has also promoted its longstanding gender and racial pay equity policy. Yet, it is unclear how Apple plans to address racial inequality in its workforce. The company states that the overall number of Hispanic and Black employees in leadership increased by 90% and 60%, respectively, from 2014-2020, but Apple currently has no Hispanics and only one Black member on its executive team. Further, Hispanic and Black tech employees only account for 8% and 4% of all tech employees, respectively. Apple shut down three employee run surveys related to pay equity that focused on minorities and women. Nonetheless, achieving true racial and gender equity goes beyond just pay issues. In August 2021, Apple placed a female engineering programming manager on indefinite leave after she accused the company of sexism, harassment, and retaliation. Additionally, Apple hired Antonio Garc&iacute;a Mart&iacute;nez, who had a history of misogynistic and racist commentary, as an advertising platform engineer. While he was fired after a highly publicized employee petition, we believe that a civil rights audit could have identified the concerns raised by Apple&#146;s employees far earlier. Civil rights issues raised by Apple&#146;s products and services are also concerning. Privacy experts, over 90 global policy organizations, and Apple&#146;s own employees have raised concerns over the company&#146;s newly developed child sexual abuse material technology, noting it could be subject to abuse and potential misuse by law enforcement. Further, targeted advertising has a history of racist and sexist impacts. Apple&#146;s advertising business increased from $300&nbsp;million in 2017 to $3&nbsp;billion in 2021. Given the importance of advertising to Apple&#146;s future profitability, we believe that it should be subject to rigorous third-party analysis of its racial and gender impacts. A civil rights audit will help Apple identify, remedy, and avoid adverse impacts on its stakeholders. We urge Apple to assess its behavior through a civil rights lens to obtain a complete picture of how it contributes to social and economic inequality.

We work every day to put people first&#151;by being a force for equity and opportunity, creating an inclusive and diverse work environment, respecting the human rights, including the civil rights, of everyone whose lives we touch, and empowering them with accessible technology. We strive to match our words and actions to our values with our standards and programs that are industry-leading, and often exceed what is required by law. &nbsp; Apple already fulfills the objectives of the proposal in several ways, including through impact and risk assessments, active governance and Board oversight, engagement with our communities and key stakeholders, and regular, transparent public reporting. We believe our current framework for the implementation and oversight of our human rights commitments is more effective than the broad and unfocused audit requested by the proposal. &nbsp; Human Rights Framework &nbsp; Apple&#146;s Human Rights Policy commitments include impact assessments of key civil rights issues . In 2020, the Board adopted Apple&#146;s Human Rights Policy&#151;Our Commitment to Human Rights, 1 outlining our commitment to respect human rights, including civil rights and the right to privacy, among other internationally recognized rights. Our approach is based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Policy reflects feedback that we have heard from our shareholders, as well as civil and human rights organizations and other stakeholders. &nbsp; In alignment with the UN Guiding Principles, we identify salient human rights risks through internal risk assessments and external industry-level third-party audits and reports, as well as through the channels we maintain with rightsholders and other stakeholders, including investors, human rights and labor experts, governments, and international bodies such as the United Nations. We conduct human rights due diligence through a number of teams, including the Privacy, Corporate, and Compliance teams within Apple&#146;s Legal and Global Security organization. Our General Counsel oversees implementation of our Human Rights Policy and reports to the Board and its committees on progress and any significant issues identified in the diligence process. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;9 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;9. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/docs/human-rights-policy Table of Contents &nbsp; 90 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Our Board and governance structure fosters informed decision-making, monitoring of our compliance, and transparency at every level of our company . The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, monitors significant business risks, including operational and reputational exposures that may relate to human rights issues.&nbsp;For example, our Chief Privacy Officer reports to Apple&#146;s General Counsel, who chairs Apple&#146;s Privacy Steering Committee with a group of senior representatives across the company. The Audit Committee reviews reports on privacy and data security matters from Apple&#146;s General Counsel, and from the heads of Information Security, Business Conduct and Compliance, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit. These reports include updates on Apple&#146;s privacy program, cybersecurity risks, risk management, and relevant legislative, regulatory, and technical developments. 2 We want everyone&#151;from our customers to our industry peers&#151;to know about our values, and the progress we&#146;re making. Accordingly, we set goals, track progress, and measure our impact in these areas and report them publicly in a variety of ways, including through our: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Environment, Social and Governance Report; 3 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Inclusion and Diversity Page; 4 and &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Privacy Transparency Report. 5 Inclusion and Diversity At Apple, we&#146;re building on our&nbsp;long-standing&nbsp;commitment to make&nbsp;our company more&nbsp;inclusive and diverse and to ensure equitable pay for all employees. We&#146;re supporting underrepresented communities with initiatives that combat inequity, expand access to opportunity, and foster belonging through community. As a sign of our commitment, Apple is a founding signatory to the ACT Report: Action to Catalyze Tech, A Paradigm Shift for DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), 6 which provides tech companies and leaders a rigorous framework of action. As a signatory, Apple has already committed to (1)&nbsp;reviewing existing diversity, equity, and inclusion practices and gaps, and identifying relevant actions to operationalize diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the company; (2)&nbsp;sharing diversity, equity, and inclusion data, metrics, and goals; and (3)&nbsp;advocating for policies that create pathways into tech for underrepresented communities and increase access to capital for diverse entrepreneurs. Apple is strengthening our long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and diverse, and we&#146;re making progress towards these goals. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Between January 2020 and December 2020, 43&nbsp;percent of open leadership roles and 29&nbsp;percent of open R&amp;D leadership roles were filled by people from underrepresented communities globally; and 37&nbsp;percent of open leadership roles and 26&nbsp;percent of open R&amp;D leadership roles were filled by women globally. Leadership roles include managers at all levels of our company. &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/governance/ 3 &nbsp; investor.apple.com/esg/2021_Apple_ESG_Report 4 &nbsp; apple.com/diversity/ 5 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/transparency/ 6 &nbsp; actreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-ACT-Report.pdf Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 91 &#149; &nbsp; Between 2014 and 2020: &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; the number of employees from underrepresented communities has increased by 64&nbsp;percent in the United States, and makes up nearly 50&nbsp;percent of Apple&#146;s U.S. workforce; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; the number of Black employees in the United States has grown by more than 50&nbsp;percent, with a 60&nbsp;percent increase in leadership; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; the number of Hispanic/Latinx employees in the United States has grown by more than 80&nbsp;percent, with a 90&nbsp;percent increase in leadership; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; the number of female employees worldwide has grown more than 70&nbsp;percent, with an 85&nbsp;percent increase in leadership. &nbsp; To build upon this growth, we&#146;re focused on robust diversity recruiting efforts, ensuring our employees have access to career development programs and ongoing inclusion and diversity education, and gauging sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance, and inclusivity. All of our employees are required to complete unconscious bias and inclusion training, with additional training for Apple&#146;s more than 15,000 managers on inclusive leadership. And inclusion and diversity measures are built into our annual review process for every leader, including those at the highest levels of the company. Additionally, we require our employees to be trained annually on Apple&#146;s Business Conduct Policy, 7 which incorporates our Human Rights Policy and sets out the fundamental principles of responsible business conduct that define the way we do business worldwide. For more than 30 years, Apple employees have found community and connection in our Diversity Network Associations (DNAs). These employee-led groups are rooted in the celebration and amplification of culturally underrepresented communities and are designed to engage and empower employees to connect with one another and to have a direct impact on the employee experience, our business, and the communities where we live and work, regardless of geography or job role. Today, over 47,000 Apple employees across the globe belong to groups like Familia@Apple, the Apple Asian Association, the Apple Indian Association, Black@Apple, Indigenous@Apple, Pride@Apple, and Women@Apple, and a range of faith-based and cultural groups. We believe that these employee-driven groups rooted in the celebration of multicultural communities provide members with the opportunity to connect, engage, and support their fellow colleagues from underrepresented groups. Apple&#146;s DNA organizations provide insight far beyond internal culture. They also help us think about ways we can uniquely contribute to Apple&#146;s products. The Photos team and the engineering teams collaborated with DNA teams regarding features like image color correction, resulting in the cameras on iPhone, iPad, and Mac being able to capture more natural-looking skin tones in video calls. Additionally, Apple has provided developers with guidelines to promote inclusion, including human interface and inclusive writing guidelines. 8 &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Business-Conduct-Policy.pdf 8 &nbsp; See developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion/overview and help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/apdcb2a65d68 Table of Contents &nbsp; 92 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; We&#146;re working to dismantle systemic racism and help grow opportunities for communities of color . Our work here doesn&#146;t stop at our own doors. 9 We are also committed to supporting and empowering communities around the world. Below are some highlights of our programs and initiatives: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; In June 2020, Apple launched the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), a long-term effort to help ensure more positive outcomes for communities of color across the country and help foster the next generation of inclusive leaders. We&#146;ve committed $130 million to focus on three key areas: expanding access to education, criminal justice, and economic empowerment. 10 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Apple is collaborating with minority-serving institutions across the country to support the leadership of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and community colleges and other centers of learning in expanding educational access. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; We are partnering with stakeholders to support the Propel Center, resourcing preeminent organizations working to end mass incarceration and racial injustice. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; We are providing mentorship to founders who have historically been cut out of funding opportunities through our Impact Accelerator and significant financial investments to support businesses with diverse founders. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; We opened a Developer Academy in Detroit&#151;the first of its kind in the United States&#151;designed to empower young Black entrepreneurs, creators, and coders, helping them cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing iOS app economy. &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; We partner with external organizations such as AnitaB.org, FIRST, Girls Who Code, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), and Human Rights Campaign (HRC), among others, to help break down systemic barriers and bias in research and development. Apple&#146;s long-standing commitment to pay equity is externally evaluated by a third party . Since 2017, we have achieved gender pay equity globally, as well as pay equity by race and ethnicity in the United States. In every country where we operate, employees of all genders earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance. These metrics are assessed by a third-party firm that evaluates compensation across all of Apple using statistical modeling. This rigorous review considers annual total compensation, including base salary, bonuses, and RSUs, as well as a variety of data related to pay, including job level, location, performance ratings, and tenure. We are also committed to closing any pay gap we find at the intersections of gender and race and ethnicity in our U.S. workforce. To help ensure internal equity, we target diverse interview panels and candidate slates so diversity is reflected at every stage of the hiring process. Moreover, to avoid perpetuating any pay inequity created by previous companies, we do not ask candidates for compensation history, and our recruiters develop offers of employment based on the compensation of current Apple employees in similar roles. During our annual compensation planning process, the People team uses analytics to assess promotion rates, performance ratings distribution, and pay metrics for women compared to men and, in the United States, for underrepresented groups compared to non-underrepresented groups. We also seek to pay a highly competitive minimum wage in the United States, and provide all employees &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; Apple promotes a diverse supplier base through our Supplier Diversity Program, established in 1993, and engages in opportunity trade fairs around the world.

And we hold our leaders accountable by incorporating Apple values and key community initiatives into our executives&#146; annual cash incentive program. Privacy We innovate to protect our customers&#146; privacy and continually assess our impact. We believe privacy is a fundamental human right, which is why we set the industry standard for minimizing data collection and build industry-leading transparency and controls into our technology. As part of our human rights commitments, we undertake Privacy Impact Assessments of our major products and services that take into consideration how laws affect privacy and assess any associated privacy risks in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate. We regularly engage with civil society representatives globally on various privacy and freedom of expression issues, including privacy by design and encryption, and Apple&#146;s Privacy Policy 11 is intended to ensure that privacy remains a top priority in all that we do. Apple&#146;s advertising platform does not track users; it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties, and no Apple Pay transactions or Health app data is accessible to Apple&#146;s advertising platform, or is used for advertising purposes. All of these policies and practices, including the type of information Apple may use and how users can view such information, are explained on our &#147;Apple Advertising and Privacy&#148; page. 12 This year, we launched App Tracking Transparency, which requires apps to ask permission when they want to track a user&#146;s data across apps and websites owned by other companies. We also launched Privacy Nutrition Labels to help users understand how apps, including apps we develop at Apple, collect and handle their data. 13 We are also committed to listening and learning from others&#146; perspectives and experiences and sharing our progress to advance meaningful change and find novel solutions to pressing challenges. For example, we previously announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and to help limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety&nbsp;features. As demonstrated above, Apple already fulfills the stated objective of the requested audit &#147;to identify, remedy, and avoid adverse impacts on its stakeholders,&#148; through our commitment to respect human rights, including civil rights such as those cited by the proponent, as outlined in our Human Rights Policy. We regularly engage with human rights and civil rights organizations, employees, customers, and other stakeholders to seek input and assess adverse impacts of our products, services, policies, and practices to advance meaningful change. Therefore, Apple believes that the audit requested by this proposal is unwarranted. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 9 . &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/privacy/ 12 &nbsp; apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-advertising/ 13 &nbsp; apple.com/privacy/control/ Table of Contents &nbsp; 94 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Proposal No.&nbsp;10 Shareholder Proposal Report on Concealment Clauses RESOLVED: Shareholders of Apple Inc. (&#147;Apple&#148;) ask that the Board of Directors prepare a public report assessing the potential risks to the company associated with its use of concealment clauses in the context of harassment, discrimination and other unlawful acts. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost and omit proprietary and personal information. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Concealment clauses are defined as any employment or post-employment agreement, such as arbitration, non-disclosure or non-disparagement agreements, that Apple asks employees or contractors to sign which would limit their ability to discuss unlawful acts in the workplace, including harassment and discrimination. WHEREAS: Apple wisely uses concealment clauses in employment agreements to protect corporate information, such as intellectual capital and trade secrets. However, Apple has not excluded from these clauses their workers&#146; rights to speak openly about harassment, discrimination and other unlawful acts. Given this, investors cannot be confident in their knowledge of Apple&#146;s workplace culture. A healthy workplace culture is linked to strong returns. McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for workplace culture post a return to shareholders 60&nbsp;percent higher than median companies and 200&nbsp;percent higher than organizations in the bottom quartile. 1 A study by the Wall Street Journal found that over a five-year period, the 20 most diverse companies in the S&amp;P 500 had an average annual stock return that was almost six percentage points higher than the 20 least diverse companies. 2 A workplace that tolerates harassment invites legal, brand, financial and human capital risk. Companies may experience reduced morale, lost productivity, absenteeism and challenges in attracting and retaining talent. 3 Employees who engage in harmful behavior may also be shielded from accountability. In California, forthcoming 4 and existing legislation prohibit concealment clauses in employment agreements involving recognized forms of discrimination and unlawful activity. Apple works under a patchwork of state laws related to the use of concealment clauses and may benefit from consistent practices across all employees and contractors. &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-organization-blog/culture-4-keys-to-why-it-matters 2 &nbsp; https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-business-case-for-more-diversity-11572091200 3 &nbsp; https://conference.iza.org/conference_files/LaborMarkets_2021/sockin_j28322.pdf 4 &nbsp; https://www.protocol.com/silenced-no-more-assembly Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 95 As hundreds of employees stopped work in protest 5 , 6 and after years of binding employees who settled discrimination claims to concealment agreements, 7 Pinterest paid $22.5&nbsp;million to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit brought by a former executive. Shareholders ultimately sued Pinterest executives alleging a breach of fiduciary duty by &#147;perpetrating or knowingly ignoring the long-standing and systemic culture of discrimination and retaliation.&#148; 8 Similarly, in 2020, as part of a $300&nbsp;million settlement of shareholder lawsuits alleging the company created a toxic work environment, Alphabet agreed to limit confidentiality restrictions associated with harassment and discrimination cases. 9 Investors have reason to be concerned with Apple, where allegations that the company retaliated against employees complaining of discrimination and potential labor law violations 10 have led workers to organize under the banner #AppleToo. 11 , 12 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html 6 &nbsp; https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/ 7 &nbsp; https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias 8 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1phvnsfffr2bp/Retirement-System-Sues-Pinterest-Board-and-Execs-Over-Discrimination 9 &nbsp; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-settlement.html 10 &nbsp; https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity 11 &nbsp; https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord 12 &nbsp; https://appletoo.us/ Table of Contents &nbsp; 96 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Apple&#146;s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No.&nbsp;10 &nbsp; Apple is deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We recognize and support the rights of our employees and contractors to speak openly about working conditions. &nbsp; Clear policies supporting employees&#146; rights . Apple&#146;s Business Conduct Policy, 1 which is available on our website, sets out Apple&#146;s expectations regarding confidentiality of unreleased products and non-public business information, and provides that &#147;nothing in this Policy should be interpreted as being restrictive of your right to speak freely about wages, hours, or working conditions.&#148; The term &#147;working conditions&#148; is widely understood to be broad and encompass terms and conditions of employment as well as the work environment, including unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment and discrimination. Accordingly, Apple employees are permitted to speak openly about unlawful acts in the workplace, including harassment and discrimination. &nbsp; The Business Conduct Policy applies to all of our full- and part-time employees worldwide and sets out the principles of honesty, respect, confidentiality and compliance that guide our employees and Apple&#146;s business practices. All employees are required to complete mandatory training on the Business Conduct Policy upon hiring and annually thereafter. We also expect our suppliers, contractors, consultants, and other business partners to follow our principles when providing goods and services to Apple or acting on Apple&#146;s behalf. The Business Conduct Policy is overseen by our Chief Compliance Officer, who provides regular updates to the Audit Committee on matters related to the policy. &nbsp; We are continually working to reinforce and clarify our policies. Most employees leave Apple without a separation agreement, but for situations where an agreement is appropriate, Apple has committed to incorporate substantially the following language in all U.S. separation agreements going forward: &#147;Nothing in this agreement prevents you from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful.&#148; &nbsp; Employee resources . Apple strives to provide a workplace free of harassment and discrimination, and we offer a range of additional resources for employees to address questions and report concerns, including People Support, the Business Conduct Helpline and the Business Conduct website, as well as an external reporting hotline. All matters are carefully and thoroughly reviewed and investigated, and our policy strictly prohibits any retaliation for reporting potential employee misconduct or participating in an investigation. We regularly review our policies to ensure they are effective, and make changes to our policies and our training to reflect emerging trends and best practices. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Vote Required &nbsp; Approval of Proposal No.&nbsp;10 requires the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. &nbsp; The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No.&nbsp;10. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Business-Conduct-Policy.pdf Table of Contents &nbsp; Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Information &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; 97 Board oversight . Apple&#146;s Board and its committees review and discuss with management matters related to our employees, including, among other things, Apple&#146;s commitments and progress towards inclusive and diverse representation among our employees, employee engagement, and business conduct and compliance. Apple recognizes and supports the rights of our employees and contractors to speak openly about harassment, discrimination, and other unlawful acts in the workplace. The report requested by the proposal on the potential risks to the company associated with its use of &#147;concealment clauses&#148; as defined by the proposal is unnecessary as Apple&#146;s existing policies, active Board oversight, and public disclosures effectively address the issues targeted by this proposal. For all of the reasons above, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 10 . Table of Contents &nbsp; 98 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Identification of Proponents Proposals No.&nbsp;5 through No. 10 were submitted for the Annual Meeting by a shareholder or shareholders who have represented to Apple that they are a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of Apple&#146;s common stock. We will promptly provide you with the name, address, and, to our knowledge, the number of voting securities held by the proponents of the shareholder proposals, upon receiving a written or oral request directed to Apple&#146;s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA, or by phone at: (408) 974-3123. Other Matters Apple knows of no other matters to be submitted to shareholders at the Annual Meeting, other than the proposals identified in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters properly come before shareholders at the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named on the proxy to vote the shares represented thereby on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

Each member is an independent director under Nasdaq and SEC rules, and meets the standards for committee independence as set forth in Apple&#146;s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Audit and Finance Committee has the duties and powers described in its written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the charter is available on Apple&#146;s website at investor.apple.com/leadership-and-governance . The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board&#146;s oversight and monitoring of: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;Apple&#146;s financial statements and other financial information provided by Apple to its shareholders and&nbsp;others; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;compliance with legal, regulatory, and public disclosure requirements; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;the independent auditors, including&nbsp;their qualifications and independence; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;Apple&#146;s system of internal controls, including the internal audit function; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;treasury and finance matters; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;enterprise risk management, privacy, and data security; &nbsp; &#149;&#8195;and the auditing, accounting, and financial reporting process generally. &nbsp; The Audit and Finance Committee does not itself prepare financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of Apple&#146;s financial statements. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work performed by Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee carefully reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services. Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit and Finance Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit and Finance Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended September&nbsp;25, 2021 with Apple&#146;s management and Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young. The Audit and Finance Committee has also discussed with Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) and the SEC. The Audit and Finance Committee also has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young&#146;s communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young its independence.

If you are a shareholder of record and you: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Indicate when voting online or by phone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board; or &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the persons named as proxy holders, Kate Adams and Luca Maestri, will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as they may determine in their best judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then such organization may generally vote your shares in their discretion on &#147;routine&#148; matters, but cannot vote on &#147;non-routine&#148; matters. Routine and Non-Routine Proposals The following proposal is considered a routine matter: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The ratification of the appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP as Apple&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm for 2022 (Proposal No.&nbsp;2). A broker or other nominee may generally vote in their discretion on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected in connection with Proposal No.&nbsp;2. The following proposals are considered non-routine matters: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Election of directors (Proposal No.&nbsp;1); &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Advisory vote to approve executive compensation (Proposal No.&nbsp;3); &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Approval of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (Proposal No.&nbsp;4); and &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Each of the shareholder proposals No.&nbsp;5 through No. 10. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a &#147;broker non-vote.&#148; Therefore, broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposal No.&nbsp;1 and Proposals No.&nbsp;3 through No. 10. Table of Contents &nbsp; 110 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; Vote Required to Approve a Proposal With respect to the election of directors (Proposal No.&nbsp;1), Apple&#146;s bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum is required to elect a director. An &#147;uncontested election of directors&#148; means an election of directors in which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election. Approval of Proposals No.&nbsp;2 through No. 10 requires, in each case, the affirmative vote of (i)&nbsp;a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Only &#147;FOR&#148; and &#147;AGAINST&#148; votes are counted for purposes of determining the votes received in connection with each proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on determining whether the affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting. In addition, for each proposal, the affirmative vote equal to a majority of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum is also required for approval. Therefore, broker non-votes and abstentions could prevent the election of a director or the approval of a proposal because they do not count as affirmative votes. Confidentiality of Votes Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Apple will not disclose the proxy instructions or ballots of individual shareholders, except: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To allow for the tabulation and certification of votes; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To facilitate a successful proxy solicitation; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To assert claims for Apple; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; To defend claims against Apple; and &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; As necessary to meet applicable legal requirements. If you write comments on your proxy card or ballot, the proxy card or ballot may be forwarded to Apple&#146;s management and the Board to review your comments.

Section 5. Shares Subject to Plan and Share Limits. (a) Basic Limitation. The Common Stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized but unissued Shares. The aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards under the Plan, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;11, is equal to: (i) 510&nbsp;million Shares, plus (ii) the number of any Shares that remained available under the 2014 Plan for new award grants on the Approval Date, and determined immediately before giving effect to the termination of the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan in connection with such approval, plus (iii) the number of any Shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan and outstanding as of the Approval Date which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after the Approval Date without being exercised, plus (iv) the number of any Shares subject to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2014 Plan that were outstanding and unvested on the Approval Date that are forfeited, terminated, cancelled or otherwise reacquired by the Company after the Approval Date without having become vested or that are exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries after the Approval Date to satisfy the Tax-Related Items related to the award (in each case, with any such Shares increasing the Shares available for issuance under the Plan based on the Full-Value Award Ratio), provided that in no event shall the Shares available for issuance under the Plan exceed 1,274,374,682 Shares (which is the sum of (1)&nbsp;the 510&nbsp;million Shares set forth above, plus (2)&nbsp;the number Table of Contents &nbsp; A-10 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; of Shares available for new award grants under the 2014 Plan on September&nbsp;25, 2021, plus (3)&nbsp;the aggregate number of Shares subject to stock options previously granted and outstanding under the 2014 Plan as of September&nbsp;25, 2021, plus (4)&nbsp;two (2) (the Full-Value Award Ratio) times the aggregate number of Shares subject to restricted stock and restricted stock units previously granted and outstanding under the 2014 Plan as of September&nbsp;25, 2021). (b) Share Count. Shares issued pursuant to Full-Value Awards will count against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan as two (2)&nbsp;Shares for every one (1)&nbsp;Share issued in connection with the Full-Value Award. Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options or SARs under the Plan will count against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan as one (1)&nbsp;Share for every one Share to which such exercise relates. For purposes of clarity, the total number of Shares subject to SARs that are exercised and settled in Shares, and the total number of Shares subject to Options that are exercised, shall be counted in full on a one-for-one basis against the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, regardless of the number of Shares actually issued upon settlement of the SARs or Options. If Awards or dividend equivalent rights are settled in cash, the Shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Except as provided in the next sentence, Shares that are subject to Awards that are forfeited, are terminated, fail to vest or for any other reason are not paid or delivered, shall again become available for Awards under the Plan; provided that any one (1)&nbsp;Share issued pursuant to a Stock Grant or subject to a Restricted Stock Unit (including Shares subject to stock-settled dividend equivalent rights) that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2)&nbsp;Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan if upon grant, the Shares underlying such forfeited or terminated Awards were counted as two (2)&nbsp;Shares against the Plan reserve. Shares that are exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Option or SAR, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the Tax-Related Items for any Option or SAR, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Full-Value Award, as well as any Shares exchanged by a Participant or withheld by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the Tax-Related Items for any Full-Value Award, shall be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan; provided that any one (1)&nbsp;Share so exchanged or withheld in connection with any Full-Value Award shall be credited as two (2)&nbsp;Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under the Plan if upon grant, the Shares underlying the related Full-Value Award were counted as two (2)&nbsp;Shares against the Plan reserve. Refer to Section&nbsp;15(i) for application of the foregoing Share limits with respect to substituted awards. (c) Share Limits. (i) Limits on Options and SARs. No Participant shall receive Options or SARs during any Fiscal Year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 7,000,000 Shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;11. (ii) Limits on Stock Grants and Restricted Stock Units. No Participant shall receive Stock Grants or Restricted Stock Units during any Fiscal Year covering, in the aggregate, in excess of 7,000,000 Shares (for this purpose, (A)&nbsp;counting such Shares on a 1-for-1 basis and (B)&nbsp;for Stock Grants or Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; A-11 Restricted Stock Units as to which the number of Shares earned is dependent on the level of attainment of performance vesting conditions, counting in respect thereof the number of Shares that may be earned at maximum performance), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;11. (d) Reservation of Shares; Fractional Shares. The Company shall at all times reserve a number of Shares sufficient to cover the Company&#146;s obligations and contingent obligations to deliver Shares with respect to Awards then outstanding under the Plan (exclusive of any dividend equivalent obligations to the extent the Company has the right to settle such rights in cash). Unless the Committee provides otherwise, no fractional Shares shall be issuable pursuant to the exercise or settlement of Awards under the Plan.

The Option Agreement shall specify whether the Option is an ISO or an NSO. (b) Number of Shares. Each Option Agreement shall specify the number of Shares that are subject to the Option, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;11. (c) Exercise Price.

The Exercise Price of an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value (110% for an ISO granted to a 10-Percent Stockholder) on the Grant Date. (d) Exercisability and Term. Each Option Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the Option is to become exercisable and/or any performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section&nbsp;10 that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. The Option Agreement shall also specify the maximum term of the Option, provided that the maximum term of an Option shall in no event exceed ten (10)&nbsp;years from the Grant Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Option Agreement, no Option can be exercised after the expiration date provided in the applicable Option Agreement. (e) Method of Exercise. An Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company or the Company&#146;s designee (or, subject to Applicable Laws and if the Company permits, by electronic or voice methods) of the number of Shares to be purchased. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the aggregate Exercise Price, plus any required Tax-Related Items (unless satisfactory arrangements have been made to satisfy such Tax-Related Items). The Company reserves the right to delay issuance of the Shares until such payment obligations are fully satisfied. Table of Contents &nbsp; A-12 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; (f) Payment for Option Shares.

Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights. (a) SAR Agreement. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a SAR Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Such SAR shall be subject to all applicable terms of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms that are not inconsistent with the Plan. A SAR Agreement may provide for a maximum limit on the amount of any payout notwithstanding the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR. Dividend equivalent rights shall not be awarded on SARs. The provisions of the various SAR Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. (b) Number of Shares. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the SAR pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;11. (c) Exercise Price.

(d) Exercisability and Term. Each SAR Agreement shall specify the date when all or any installment of the SAR is to become exercisable and/or any performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section&nbsp;10 that must be satisfied before the SAR is exercised. The SAR Agreement shall also specify the maximum term of the SAR which shall not exceed ten (10)&nbsp;years from the Grant Date. SARs may be awarded in combination with Options or Stock Grants, and such an Award shall provide that the SARs will not be exercisable unless the related Options or Stock Grants are forfeited. A SAR may be included in an ISO only at the time of grant but may be included in an NSO at the time of grant or at any subsequent time. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the SAR Agreement, no SAR can be exercised after the expiration date provided in the applicable SAR Agreement. (e) Exercise of SARs. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Participant (or any person having the right to exercise the SAR after Participant&#146;s death) shall receive from the Company (i)&nbsp;Shares, (ii)&nbsp;cash or (iii)&nbsp;any combination of Shares and cash, as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant of the SAR, in its sole discretion. The amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of Shares received upon exercise of SARs shall, in the aggregate, be equal to the amount by which the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; A-13 date of exercise) of the Shares subject to the exercised SARs exceeds the aggregate Exercise Price of the exercised SARs. Section 8. Terms and Conditions for Stock Grants. (a) Form of Awards. Awards under this Section&nbsp;8 may be granted in the form of a Stock Grant. (b) Stock Grant Agreement. Each Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall be evidenced and governed exclusively by a Stock Grant Agreement between the Participant and the Company. Each Stock Grant shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the Plan that the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in the applicable Stock Grant Agreement. The provisions of the Stock Grant Agreements entered into under the Plan need not be identical. (c) Number of Shares. Each Stock Grant Agreement shall specify the number of Shares to which the Stock Grant pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;11. (d) Vesting Conditions. The Committee shall determine the vesting schedule of each Stock Grant. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Stock Grant Agreement, which may include performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section&nbsp;10. (e) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holder of a Stock Grant awarded under the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the Company&#146;s other shareholders, except as otherwise stated in the Stock Grant Agreement; provided, however, that any dividends will be subject to forfeiture and termination (or repayment, as applicable) to the same extent as the corresponding portion of the Stock Grant to which such dividends relate. A Stock Grant Agreement may require that the holder of such Stock Grant invest any cash dividends received in additional Shares subject to the Stock Grant. Such additional Shares and any Shares received as a dividend pursuant to the Stock Grant shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Stock Grant with respect to which the dividends were paid. Section 9. Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Units. (a) Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. Each RSU granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement between the Participant and the Company.

Each Restricted Stock Unit Agreement shall specify the number of RSUs to which the Restricted Stock Unit Award pertains, which number is subject to adjustment in accordance with Section&nbsp;11. (c) Vesting Conditions. The Committee shall determine the vesting schedule of each RSU Award. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, which may include performance conditions or Performance Goals pursuant to Section&nbsp;10. Table of Contents &nbsp; A-14 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; (d) Form and Time of Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. Settlement of vested RSUs may be made in the form of (i)&nbsp;cash, (ii)&nbsp;Shares or (iii)&nbsp;any combination of both, as determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the RSUs, in its sole discretion. Vested RSUs may be settled in a lump sum or in installments as determined by the Committee and provided in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. The distribution may occur or commence when the vesting conditions applicable to the RSUs have been satisfied or have lapsed, or, if the Committee so provides in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, it may be deferred, in accordance with Applicable Laws, to a later date. The amount of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents, as determined by the Committee and provided in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. (e) Voting and Dividend Rights. The holders of RSUs shall have no voting rights. Prior to settlement or forfeiture, any RSU awarded under the Plan may, at the Committee&#146;s discretion, carry with it a right to dividend equivalent rights. A dividend equivalent right entitles the holder to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one Share while the RSU is outstanding and shall be subject to forfeiture and termination to the same extent as the corresponding RSUs to which the dividend equivalent rights relate. Dividend equivalent rights may be converted into additional RSUs, subject to Applicable Laws. Dividend equivalent rights will be subject to the same vesting conditions and restrictions as the RSUs to which they attach. Subject to Applicable Laws, settlement of dividend equivalent rights may be made in the form of cash, in the form of Shares, or in a combination of both, as determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the RSUs, in its sole discretion. (f) Creditors&#146; Rights. A holder of RSUs shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. RSUs represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. Section 10. Performance-Based Awards. The Committee may, in its discretion, include performance conditions in an Award. The Committee may provide at the time it establishes the applicable Performance Goals, or at a later time, for the Performance Goals (or performance against the Performance Goals, as the case may be) to be adjusted to mitigate the unbudgeted impact of material, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, accounting changes or other events specified by the Committee. Section 11. Protection Against Dilution. (a) Adjustments. Subject to Section&nbsp;15(d), upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to): any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; a Change of Control, or any merger, combination, consolidation, or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, then the Committee shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1)&nbsp;the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards (including the specific Share limits, maximums and numbers of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2)&nbsp;the number, amount and type of Shares (or other Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; A-15 securities or property) subject to any outstanding Awards, (3)&nbsp;the grant, purchase, or Exercise Price of any outstanding Awards, and/or (4)&nbsp;the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Awards. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Award Agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company as an entirety, the Company shall equitably and proportionately adjust the Performance Goals applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based Awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based Awards. It is intended that, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Sections&nbsp;424 and 409A) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements. Without limiting the generality of Section&nbsp;3, any good faith determination by the Committee as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section&nbsp;11(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. (b) Participant Rights. Except as provided in this Section&nbsp;11, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any issue by the Company of stock of any class or securities convertible into stock of any class, any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class. If by reason of an adjustment pursuant to this Section&nbsp;11 a Participant&#146;s Award covers additional or different shares of stock or securities, then such additional or different shares and the Award in respect thereof shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions which were applicable to the Award and the Shares underlying the Award prior to such adjustment, unless otherwise determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Section 12. Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control then the Committee may make provision for a cash payment in settlement of, or for the assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding Awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Stock upon or in respect of such Change of Control. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, then, unless the Committee has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the Award or the Award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances, each Award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holder of an Option or SAR shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise the Participant&#146;s outstanding vested Options and SARs in accordance with their terms before the termination of such Awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days&#146; notice of the impending termination be required). The Committee may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding Awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of Options, SARs or similar rights, but Table of Contents &nbsp; A-16 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the Exercise Price of the Award. The Committee may take such action contemplated by this Section&nbsp;12 prior to a Change of Control (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Committee deems the action necessary to permit the Participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the Shares underlying the outstanding Awards. Without limiting the generality of Section&nbsp;3, any good faith determination by the Committee pursuant to its authority under this Section&nbsp;12 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons. Section 13. Limitations on Rights. (a) Participant Rights. A Participant&#146;s rights, if any, in respect of or in connection with any Award are derived solely from the discretionary decision of the Company to permit the individual to participate in the Plan and to benefit from a discretionary Award. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant expressly acknowledges that there is no obligation on the part of the Company to continue the Plan and/or grant any additional Awards, Shares underlying such Awards or the cash equivalent. Any Award granted hereunder is not intended to be compensation of a continuing or recurring nature, or part of a Participant&#146;s normal or expected compensation, and in no way represents any portion of a Participant&#146;s salary, compensation, or other remuneration for purposes of pension benefits, severance, redundancy, resignation or any other purpose. Neither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give any individual a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or director of the Company, a Parent, or any Subsidiary. The Company and its Parent and Subsidiaries reserve the right to Terminate the Service of any person at any time, and for any reason, subject to Applicable Laws, the Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any applicable written employment agreement (if any), and such terminated person shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any claim to damages or specific performance for breach of contract or dismissal, compensation for loss of office, tort or otherwise with respect to the Plan or any outstanding Award that is forfeited and/or is terminated by its terms or to any future Award. (b) Shareholders&#146; Rights. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;8(e), a Participant shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares underlying a Participant&#146;s Award prior to the issuance of such Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date when such Shares are issued, except as expressly provided in Sections 8(e),&nbsp;9(e) and 11. (c) Regulatory Requirements. Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, the obligation of the Company to issue Shares or other securities under the Plan shall be subject to all Applicable Laws and such approval by any regulatory body as may be required. The Company reserves the right to restrict, in whole or in part, the delivery of Shares or other securities pursuant to any Award prior to the satisfaction of all legal requirements relating to the issuance of such Shares or other securities, to their registration, qualification or listing or to an exemption from registration, qualification or listing. The person acquiring Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; A-17 any securities under the Plan will, if requested by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as the Committee may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal, tax, and accounting requirements. (d) Foreign Awards and Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in order to facilitate compliance with Applicable Laws in countries in which the Company, Parent or Subsidiaries have Participants, the Committee shall have the power and authority to modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Participants to facilitate compliance with Applicable Laws of the certain jurisdictions where Participants reside and/or establish sub-plans, rules or procedures applicable to particular Subsidiaries or Participants residing in certain jurisdictions; provided, however, that no such sub-plans, modifications or rules shall increase the Share limitations contained in Section&nbsp;5 or result in any other changes to the Plan giving rise to shareholder approval. Section 14. Taxes; Section&nbsp;409A. (a) General. The Company, a Parent and any Subsidiaries each shall have the authority and right to deduct or withhold or require a Participant to remit an amount sufficient to satisfy Tax-Related Items with respect to any taxable event concerning a Participant arising as a result of the Plan or take any other action as may be necessary in the option of the Company, a Parent or any Subsidiary, as appropriate, to satisfy withholding obligations for the payment of Tax-Related Items. The Company, a Parent or any Subsidiary may, in its sole discretion and subject to such as rules as it may adopt, permit or require a Participant to pay all or a portion of the Tax-Related Items arising in connection with an Award, by, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;having the Participant pay an amount in cash (by check or wire transfer), (ii) withholding from the Participant&#146;s wages or other cash compensation; (iii)&nbsp;withholding from the proceeds from the sale of Shares underlying an Award either through a voluntary or mandatory sale arranged by the Company on a Participant&#146;s behalf, (iv)&nbsp;withholding from any amount payable under the Plan, including delivery of Shares to be made pursuant to an Award granted under the Plan, (vi)&nbsp;delivery of Shares (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest) that have been both held by the Participant and vested for at least six (6)&nbsp;months (or such other period as established from time to time by the Committee to avoid adverse accounting treatment under applicable accounting standards) having an aggregate Fair Market Value approximately equal to the amount to be withheld, or (vii)&nbsp;any other method of withholding determined by the Committee that is permissible under Applicable Laws. Further, the Company may take any such actions as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such Tax-Related Items. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares or make any cash payment under the Plan until such withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items are satisfied, and the Company shall have no liability to any Participant for exercising the foregoing right. (b) Share Withholding. The Committee may (i)&nbsp;permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of the Participant&#146;s withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items by having the Company withhold all or a portion of any Shares that otherwise would be issued to the Participant, or (ii)&nbsp;permit a Participant to satisfy such obligations by Cashless Exercise, or by surrendering all or a portion of any Shares that the Participant previously acquired, provided that the previously owned Shares have been held for a minimum duration (if any) determined satisfactory as established by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion and further provided that Shares that are withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items at the maximum rate applicable in the Participant&#146;s Table of Contents &nbsp; A-18 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; jurisdiction(s). Any payment of Tax-Related Items by assigning Shares to the Company may be subject to restrictions, including, but not limited to, any restrictions established by the Committee or required by rules of the SEC. Subject to Applicable Laws and unless the Committee indicates otherwise, if any Shares are used to satisfy Tax-Related Items, such Shares shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value on the date of the withholding event or the last preceding trading day prior to the withholding event. (c) Section 409A. This Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section&nbsp;409A or an exemption or exclusion therefrom and, with respect to amounts that are subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A, it is intended that this Plan be administered in all respects in accordance with Code Section&nbsp;409A. Each payment under any Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Code Section&nbsp;409A. In no event may a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under any Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section&nbsp;409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a &#147;specified employee&#148; within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company), amounts in respect of an Award that constitute &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation&#148; within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;409A that would otherwise be payable by reason of a Participant&#146;s Separation from Service during the six-month period immediately following such Separation from Service shall instead be paid or provided on the first business day following the date that is six months following the Participant&#146;s Separation from Service. If the Participant dies following the Separation from Service and prior to the payment of any amounts delayed on account of Code Section&nbsp;409A, such amounts shall be paid to the Participant&#146;s estate or the personal representative of the Participant&#146;s estate within 30 days following the date of the Participant&#146;s death. Section 15. Duration and Amendments; Miscellaneous. (a) Term of the Plan. The Board adopted this Plan on November&nbsp;9, 2021 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;). The Plan shall terminate on the day before the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date and may be terminated on any earlier date pursuant to this Section&nbsp;15. (b) Amendment or Termination of the Plan. The Board may, at any time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend the Plan, in whole or in part. No Awards may be granted during any period that the Board suspends the Plan. To the extent then required by Applicable Laws or deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee, any amendment to the Plan shall be subject to shareholder approval. (c) Amendments to Awards. Without limiting any other express authority of the Committee under (but subject to) the express limits of the Plan, the Committee by agreement or resolution may waive conditions of or limitations on Awards to Participants that the Committee in the prior exercise of its discretion has imposed, without the consent of a Participant, and (subject to the requirements of Sections&nbsp;3 and 15(d)) may make other changes to the terms and conditions of Awards. No amendment of an Award, however, shall constitute a Re-Pricing without shareholder approval or otherwise authorize any action that may only be taken at law or under the rules of the principal exchange upon which the Shares are listed to trade with the consent or approval of shareholders without obtaining or conditioning such action on the receipt of such consent or approval. Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; A-19 (d) Limitations on Amendments to Plan and Awards. No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or amendment of any outstanding Award Agreement shall, without written consent of the Participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the Participant any rights or benefits of the Participant or obligations of the Company under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the effective date of such change, provided that any amendments to outstanding Award Agreements that the Company determines are necessary or desirable to facilitate compliance with Applicable Laws shall not require written consent of the Participant. Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section&nbsp;11 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section&nbsp;15. (e) Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal Laws. (f) Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect. (g) Section Headings. Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof. (h) No Corporate Action Restriction. The existence of the Plan, the Award Agreements and the Awards granted hereunder shall not limit, affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Board or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize: (i)&nbsp;any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the capital structure or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii)&nbsp;any Change of Control or other merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii)&nbsp;any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv)&nbsp;any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Subsidiary, (v)&nbsp;any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (vi)&nbsp;the payment at the discretion of the Board or the Committee of any type or form of compensation that may be made at law and without contravention of any requirement of the principal exchange upon which the Shares are traded; or (vii)&nbsp;any other corporate act or proceeding by the Company or any Subsidiary. No Participant, beneficiary or any other person shall have any claim under any Award or Award Agreement against any member of the Board or the Committee, or the Company or any Employees, officers or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action. (i) Stock-Based Awards in Substitution for Options or Awards Granted by Other Company. Awards may be granted under the Plan in substitution for or in connection with an assumption of employee, director and/or consultant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or other stock-based awards granted by other entities to persons who are or who will become Employees or Consultants in respect of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries in connection with a distribution, merger or other reorganization by or with the granting entity or an affiliated entity, or the acquisition by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of all or a substantial part of the stock or assets of the granting entity. The Awards so granted may reflect the original terms of the related award being assumed or substituted for and need not comply with other specific terms of the Plan, with Common Stock substituted for the securities covered by the original award and with the number of Shares subject to such awards, as well as any exercise or purchase prices applicable to such awards, adjusted to account for differences in stock prices in connection with the transaction. Any shares that are delivered and any Awards that are Table of Contents &nbsp; A-20 &nbsp; Proxy&nbsp;Statement &nbsp; granted by, or become obligations of, the Company, as a result of any such assumption or substitution in connection with any such transaction shall not be counted against the Share limit or other limits on the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan, unless required by Applicable Laws or determined otherwise by the Company. (j) Stock Certificates; Book Entry Procedures. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee or required by Applicable Laws, rules or regulations, the Company shall not deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection with any Award and instead such Shares shall be recorded in the books of the Company (or as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator). (k) Insider Trading. Each Participant who receives an Award will comply with the Company&#146;s Insider Trading Policy or any other policy adopted by the Company from time to time covering transactions in the Company&#146;s Shares, as well as any applicable insider trading or market abuse laws in a Participant&#146;s jurisdiction. (l) Recoupment/Clawback. An Award granted under the Plan will be subject to any provisions of Applicable Laws providing for the recoupment or clawback&nbsp;of&nbsp;incentive compensation; the terms of any Company recoupment, clawback or similar policy in effect at the time of grant of the Award;&nbsp;and any recoupment, clawback or similar provisions that may be included in the applicable Award Agreement.
