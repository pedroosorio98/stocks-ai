ï»¿ Microsoft 2014 Annual Report Menu --> Shareholder Letter TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES: It is a humbling experience to write this letter to you as only the third CEO in Microsoft&rsquo;s history. As I said when I took this role, I originally joined Microsoft to have an opportunity to change the world through technology and empower people to do amazing things. Many companies aspire to change the world, but very few have the talent, resources and perseverance of Microsoft. I believe this is a landmark moment for the company and for our industry as a whole. Cloud and mobile technologies are redefining how people work and play. Three billion people will soon be connected to Internet-enabled devices; 212 billion sensors will come online in a few short years; trillions will be spent in consumer and business technologies. But it&rsquo;s not about technology for technology's sake! It&rsquo;s our mission to enable the use of technology to realize the true potential of people, teams and organizations. As I shared in my email to employees in July, we will be the productivity and platform company for this mobile-first and cloud-first world. We will empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more. And we will accomplish this by building incredible Digital Work and Life Experiences, supported by our Cloud Operating System, the Device Operating System and Hardware platforms. In the same way that we aspired to and achieved our original vision of a PC on every desk and in every home, we will reinvent productivity. This clarity of purpose and boldness of our aspiration inspires me and all of us at Microsoft. We began to take steps toward this core focus last fiscal year. To drive our mobile strategy, we acquired Nokia&rsquo;s Devices and Services business, creating an expanded Microsoft Devices Group that includes Nokia phones, Xbox hardware, Surface, Perceptive Pixel products and accessories. We also announced Office on iPad, which led to 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote â becoming many of the most popular applications in the Apple App Store. In addition, we introduced Cortana, a personal assistant built into Windows Phone 8.1 that learns and provides information proactively to users, while protecting their privacy. And we launched the Surface Pro 3, a groundbreaking new tablet built to replace your laptop. Finally, we provided Windows licenses at zero dollars for any original equipment manufacturer building a device less than nine inches in size, which we expect to drive an amazing mix of innovative, low-cost devices for consumers this year. We continued to build upon our success in the cloud. Commercial cloud revenue hit a $4.4 billion annual run-rate, making us an undisputed leader; we grew Hyper-V to 30.6 percent of the market, taking share from competitors; and we expanded our datacenter footprint into Australia, Brazil, Japan and China. We brought industry-leading in-memory technology to the new version of SQL Server 2014, and we launched two cloud-based services â the Enterprise Mobility Suite for handling identity and security on devices, and the Azure Intelligent Systems Service for managing the &ldquo;Internet of Things.&rdquo; Despite this busy year of new products and significant change for the company, we delivered strong results, including revenue of more than $86 billion, gross margin of nearly $60 billion and operating income of $27.8 billion. We also returned more than $15.7 billion in cash to our shareholders, a 27 percent increase from 2013. Looking forward, we have a rich product road map that positions us to thrive in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. For example, we recently launched Delve, an Office 365 cloud-based service that automatically brings relevant documents, data and other artifacts to workers. And we announced our intention to acquire Mojang the, Stockholm-based game developer of the popular &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; franchise, a game that spans PCs, consoles, tablets and mobile. We also plan to launch Skype Translator this fiscal year, which has the potential to dramatically break down language barriers in our communications. And, perhaps most important, we recently previewed new features and innovations in the next version of Windows, Windows 10. All of these new services and experiences will be underpinned by significant investments in our cloud strategy â including building more datacenters and increasing capacity in existing regions; expanding our hybrid cloud offerings with new releases of StorSimple, InMage and other products; and launching new cloud capabilities, such as Azure Machine Learning, an offering that has the potential to be game-changing in helping people mine data for predictions. As CEO, I am committed to ensuring Microsoft makes the most of this landmark moment. And, at the same time, it is equally important to evolve our culture â becoming more customer-obsessed across all our products, focusing on leading indicators like usage, and ensuring Microsoft continues to be the best place for smart, curious people to do great work. I believe reinventing productivity and building platforms that empower every person and organization on the planet to do more and achieve more is a huge undertaking. But it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on. We are ready again to change the world. Thank you for your continued support, &nbsp; Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer October 9, 2014 Selected Financial Data Financial Highlights (In millions, except per share data) Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 (a) 2013 2012 2011 2010 Revenue $ Â 86,833 $ 77,849 $ 73,723 $ 69,943 $ 62,484 Operating income $ Â 27,759 $ 26,764 (c) $ 21,763 (d) $ 27,161 $ 24,098 Net income $ Â 22,074 (b) $ 21,863 (c) $ 16,978 (d) $ 23,150 $ 18,760 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.63 (b) $ 2.58 (c) $ 2.00 (d) $ 2.69 $ 2.10 Cash dividends declared per share $ 1.12 $ 0.92 $ 0.80 $ 0.64 $ 0.52 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ Â 85,709 $ 77,022 $ 63,040 $ 52,772 $ 36,788 Total assets $ 172,384 $ 142,431 $ 121,271 $ 108,704 $ 86,113 Long-term obligations $ 36,975 $ 26,070 $ 22,220 $ 22,847 $ 13,791 Stockholders' equity $ 89,784 $ 78,944 $ 66,363 $ 57,083 $ 46,175 (a) On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia's Devices and Services business ("NDS").

Our mission is to enable people and organizations throughout the world to do more and achieve more by creating technology that transforms the way people learn, work, play, and communicate. We develop and market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people&rsquo;s lives. We do business worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries. We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience. In addition to selling individual products and services, we offer suites of products and services. Our products include operating systems for computing devices, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; productivity applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and online advertising. We also design and sell hardware including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, and content over the Internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers. Examples of cloud-based computing services we offer include Bing, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Office 365, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, and Yammer. Cloud revenue is earned primarily from usage fees, advertising, and subscriptions. We also provide consulting and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers. We conduct research and develop advanced technologies for future software, devices, and services. We believe that we will continue to grow and meet our customers&rsquo; needs as the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. We will continue to create new opportunities for partners, increase customer satisfaction, and improve our service excellence, business efficacy, and internal processes. OPERATING SEGMENTS During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments: Devices and Consumer (&ldquo;D&amp;C&rdquo;) Licensing, D&amp;C Hardware, D&amp;C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other. On April&nbsp;25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all of Nokia Corporation&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Nokia&rdquo;) Devices and Services Business (&ldquo;NDS&rdquo;). We report the financial performance of NDS in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&amp;C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&amp;C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements. Devices and Consumer Our D&amp;C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, entertain and connect people, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&amp;C segments are made up of D&amp;C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&amp;C Other. D&amp;C Licensing The principal products and services provided by the D&amp;C Licensing segment are: Windows, including original equipment manufacturer (&ldquo;OEM&rdquo;) licensing (&ldquo;Windows OEM&rdquo;) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (&ldquo;Office Consumer&rdquo;); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue. The Windows operating system is designed to empower individuals, companies, and organizations to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user&rsquo;s hardware and software. Windows revenue growth is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by: the mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size; differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets; attachment of Windows to devices shipped; customer mix between consumer, small and medium sized businesses, and large enterprises; changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel; pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large, multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed; piracy; and sales of packaged software. The versions of Office included in our D&amp;C Licensing segment are designed to increase personal productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content management and collaboration. Office Consumer revenue is impacted by sales to customers that buy Office with their new devices and by product launches, as well as the transition to Office 365 Consumer, our subscription-based cloud service that provides access to Office plus other productivity services. Office 365 Consumer revenue is included in our D&amp;C Other segment. The Windows Phone operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. As noted above, prior to our acquisition of NDS, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established products and services to new markets through a strategic alliance. Windows Phone revenue associated with this contractual relationship was reflected in D&amp;C Licensing. Windows Phone revenue also includes revenue from licensing mobile-related patents. Competition The Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity, and the largest support network for any operating system. Competitors to the versions of Office included in D&amp;C Licensing include global application vendors such as Apple and Google, numerous web-based competitors, and local application developers in Asia and Europe. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note taking, and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite and distributes its productivity services through the Android and Chrome operating systems. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications can also position themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy to use solutions that work across a variety of devices. Windows Phone operating system faces competition from iOS, Android, and Blackberry operating systems. Windows Phone competes based on differentiated user interface, personalized applications, compatibility with Windows PCs and tablets, and other unique capabilities. Computing and Gaming Hardware The principal products and services provided by the Computing and Gaming Hardware segment are: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (&ldquo;Xbox Platform&rdquo;); Surface devices and accessories; and Microsoft PC accessories. The Xbox Platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment choices through the use of our devices, peripherals, content, and online services. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November 2005 and November&nbsp;2013, respectively. Surface devices are designed to help organizations, students, and consumers to be more productive, offering accessories and compatibility with peripherals. Surface devices were first released in October 2012. Our latest Surface device, the Surface Pro 3, was released in June 2014. Competition Our Xbox Platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers. The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released their latest generation console in November 2012. Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013. We believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the console, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals. In addition to Sony and Nintendo, we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces.&nbsp;We believe the Xbox Platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Surface devices face competition from computer, tablet, and other hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers. Phone Hardware The principal products and services provided by the new Phone Hardware segment are Lumia Smartphones and other non-Lumia phones, which we began manufacturing and selling with the acquisition of NDS on April&nbsp;25, 2014. Competition Our phones face competition primarily from Samsung and Apple, as well as many other mobile device manufacturers. We believe our phones will compete by being tailored for virtually every demographic and geography worldwide, offering unique industrial design and imaging technologies at high and low ranges of price points, and by incorporating Microsoft&rsquo;s digital work and digital life experiences. D&amp;C Other The principal products and services provided by the D&amp;C Other segment are: Resale, including the Windows Store, Xbox Live transactions, and the Windows Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; and our retail stores. Windows Store and Windows Phone Store are online application marketplaces that are designed to benefit our developers and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base and benefit users by providing centralized access to certified applications. Xbox Live transactions consist of online entertainment content, such as games, music, movies, and TV shows, accessible on Xbox consoles and other devices. Search and display advertising includes Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, Windows Services, and Xbox ads. We are the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites worldwide. We have completed the Yahoo! worldwide algorithmic transition and the paid search transition in the U.S. and planned international markets. Office 365 Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of Microsoft Office programs and services delivered across multiple platforms via the cloud. Studios designs and markets games for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and online. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users and increase engagement by developing a deep library of content which consumers seek. Competition We face competition for our Resale products and services from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, and Google. Our search and display advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals like Yahoo! that provide content and online offerings to end users. Our success depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. We believe we can attract new users by continuing to offer new and compelling products and services. We differentiate our offerings by providing a broad selection of content that helps users make faster, informed decisions, and take action more quickly by providing relevant search results, expanded search services, and deeply-integrated social recommendations. Competitors to Office 365 Consumer are the same as those discussed above for Office Consumer. Competitors to Studios are the same as those discussed above for our Xbox gaming and entertainment business, as well as game studios like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Commercial Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and organization productivity and efficiency, and to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user&rsquo;s hardware and software. Commercial is made up of the Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other segments. Commercial Licensing The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Licensing segment are: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (&ldquo;CAL&rdquo;); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic (&ldquo;Windows Commercial&rdquo;); Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CAL (&ldquo;Office Commercial&rdquo;); Skype; and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online. Our server products are designed to make information technology professionals and developers and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Revenue comes from product revenue, including purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged product. CAL provide access rights to certain server and Office products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync. CAL revenue is reported along with the associated server or Office product. Windows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems, including the Internet of Things, by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services. Windows Commercial revenue is mainly affected by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. The versions of Office in Commercial Licensing are designed to increase personal, team and organizational productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance and the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Skype is designed to connect friends, family, clients, and colleagues through a variety of devices. Revenue is largely driven by the sale of minutes, subscriptions, and advertising. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed. Competition Our server operating system products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that compete with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java middleware such as Geronimo, Wildfly, and Spring Framework. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, other companies, and open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among others. Our embedded systems compete in a highly fragmented environment in which key competitors include IBM, Intel, and versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Metrowerks and MontaVista Software. We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. Competitors to Windows Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Windows in the D&amp;C Licensing segment. Office Commercial revenue growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content management, enterprise search, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Competitors to Office Commercial includes software application vendors such as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and numerous web-based competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications can also position themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, easy to use solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have and are available on a device or via the cloud. Skype competes with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Our Microsoft Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Oracle and SAP in the market for large organizations and divisions of global enterprises. In the market focused on providing solutions for small and mid-sized businesses, our Microsoft Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Infor, The Sage Group, and NetSuite.&nbsp;Salesforce.com&rsquo;s cloud CRM offerings compete directly with Microsoft Dynamics CRM on-premises offerings. Commercial Other The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Other segment are: Enterprise Services, including Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure. Enterprise Services, including Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and information technology professionals on various Microsoft products. Office 365 Commercial is an online services offering that includes Microsoft Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync, and is available across a variety of devices and platforms. Dynamics CRM Online is designed to provide customer relationship management and supply chain management for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed. Microsoft Azure is a scalable operating system with computing, storage, database, and management, along with comprehensive cloud solutions, from which customers can build, deploy, and manage enterprise workloads and web applications. These services also include a platform that helps developers build and connect applications and services in the cloud. Our goal is to enable customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their businesses, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Competition The Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. Competitors to Office 365 Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Office Commercial. Microsoft Dynamics CRM&rsquo;s online offerings primarily compete with Salesforce.com&rsquo;s on-demand CRM offerings. Microsoft Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and other open source offerings. Operations We have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate data centers throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia regions. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our Xbox consoles and games, Surface devices, and Microsoft PC accessories are manufactured by third party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. With the acquisition of NDS, we now operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones in Brazil, China, Hungary, Mexico, and Vietnam. All our devices may include key components that are available from only one or limited sources. Disruption of component supply from these suppliers could potentially lead to a disruption of production of certain devices. Research and Development During fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, research and development expense was $ 11.4 billion, $ 10.4 billion, and $ 9.8&nbsp;billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13% of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through four primary engineering groups. Applications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, search, and other information categories. Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on development of Microsoft&rsquo;s back-end technologies like datacenter, database, and our specific technologies for enterprise IT scenarios and development tools. This group also engineers datacenter development, construction, and operation. Devices Engineering Group, focuses on all hardware development and supply chain, including Xbox consoles, Surface devices, Lumia Smartphones, other non-Lumia phones, Perceptive Pixel products, and accessories. Operating Systems Engineering Group, focuses on Microsoft&rsquo;s operating systems for consoles, mobile devices, PCs, and back-end systems. Studios and Universal Store, the core cloud services for marketplaces, membership, and commerce platform, are also in this group. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 55,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 40,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees&rsquo; or Microsoft&rsquo;s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. In conjunction with the NDS acquisition, we received an initial 10-year non-exclusive license to certain Nokia patents. We also agreed to license Nokia&rsquo;s mapping services and granted Nokia reciprocal rights to use our patents for their mapping and location services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Microsoft&rsquo;s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. We maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning communication and collaboration, information access and organization, entertainment, business and e-commerce, advertising, and devices. While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world&rsquo;s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our product and service innovation. Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth in productivity, platforms, cloud computing, search, communications, and smart connected devices. Distribution, Sales, and Marketing We market and distribute our products and services primarily through the following channels: OEMs; distributors and resellers; online; and Microsoft retail stores. OEMs We distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new PCs, tablets, servers, smartphones, and other intelligent devices that they sell to end customers. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition to these products, we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as Windows with Bing or Windows with Office 365 subscription. There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which operate globally, are referred to as &ldquo;Direct OEMs,&rdquo; as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HTC, Hewlett-Packard, LG, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called &ldquo;system builders&rdquo;), which source their Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Distributors and Resellers Many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us, with sales support from solution integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and developers that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (&ldquo;Enterprise Agreement Direct Advisors&rdquo;, or &ldquo;EDAs&rdquo;). Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through license solutions partners (&ldquo;LSPs&rdquo;), distributors, value-added resellers (&ldquo;VARs&rdquo;), OEMs, system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small-sized and medium-sized organizations. EDAs typically are also authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and Open licensing programs discussed under &ldquo;Licensing Options&rdquo; below. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International. Our Microsoft Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets, such as Wal-Mart, Dixons, and Microsoft retail stores. We distribute our hardware products, including Surface, Xbox, phones, and PC accessories, through third-party retailers and Microsoft retail stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers, and provides product training and sales support. Online Although on-premises software will continue to be an important part of our business, increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloud-based services. We provide online content and services to consumers through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Windows Phone Store, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, Skype, and Windows Store. We also provide commercial cloud-based services such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Azure, and Office 365 consisting of online versions of Microsoft Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and Yammer. Other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for advertisers and publishers, as well as Microsoft Developer Network subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions. As we increasingly deliver online services, we sell many of these cloud-based services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and medium-sized businesses.&nbsp;These new programs include direct sales, direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors, and resell of services through operator channels, such as telephone, cell, and cable providers. We also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. LICENSING OPTIONS We license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services. Our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing agreements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. Customer Licensing Programs Open Licensing Designed primarily for small-to-medium organizations, Open Programs allows customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and, at the customer&rsquo;s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period (two or three years depending on the Open Programs used). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance. Software assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Open Programs has several variations to fit customers&rsquo; diverse way of purchasing. Under the Open Program, customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance. They can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. Office 365 is also available for purchase through the Open Program. Select Plus Licensing Designed primarily for medium-to-large organizations, the Select Plus Program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&rsquo;s election, software assurance over a specified time period (generally three years or less). Similar to Open Programs, the Select Plus Program allows customers to acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with software assurance, or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. A subset of online services are also available for purchase through the Select Plus Program, and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years. Enterprise Agreement Licensing Designed primarily for medium- and large-sized organizations that want to acquire licenses to Online Services and/or software products, along with software assurance, for all or substantial parts of their enterprise. Enterprises can elect to acquire perpetual licenses or, under the Enterprise Subscription Program, can acquire non-perpetual, subscription agreements for a specified time period (generally three years). Online Services are also available for purchase through the enterprise agreement and subscriptions are generally structured with three year terms. Customer Licensing Programs â Online Services Only Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed to enable small and medium-sized businesses to easily purchase Microsoft Online Services (excluding Azure). The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Microsoft Azure Agreement is designed to enable small and medium-sized businesses to purchase Microsoft Azure Subscription plans on a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; basis. Partner Programs The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement is a program targeted at service providers and Independent Software Vendors allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Agreements are generally structured with a three-year term, and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption. Microsoft Online Services Reseller Agreement is a program enabling partners to package Microsoft Online Services with the partners&rsquo; services. Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program is a program that enables partners to use Microsoft software in their own software programs. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and small and medium-sized organizations obtain our products primarily through distributors, resellers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2014, 2013, or 2012 revenue. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. EMPLOYEES As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we employed approximately 128,000 people on a full-time basis, 62,000 in the U.S. and 66,000 internationally, including approximately 25,000 employees transferred as part of the NDS acquisition in April, 2014. Of the total employed people, 44,000 were in product research and development, 30,000 in sales and marketing, 23,000 in product support and consulting services, 20,000 in manufacturing and distribution, and 11,000 in general and administration. In July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan which will eliminate up to 18,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including 12,500 professional and factory positions related to the acquisition of NDS. As a result of the NDS acquisition, we have certain employees that are subject to collective bargaining agreements. AVAILABLE INFORMATION Our Internet address is www.microsoft.com. At our Investor Relations website, www.microsoft.com/investor, we make available free of charge a variety of information for investors. Our goal is to maintain the Investor Relations website as a portal through which investors can easily find or navigate to pertinent information about us, including: our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with or furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;); information on our business strategies, financial results, and key performance indicators; announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available; press releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news; corporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of conduct and ethics, global corporate citizenship initiatives, and other governance-related policies; other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting; and opportunities to sign up for email alerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website. Discussion &amp; Analysis MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (&ldquo;MD&amp;A&rdquo;) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology leader focused on being the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. We strive to reinvent productivity to empower people and organizations to do more and achieve more. We create technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate across a wide range of computing devices. We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and competitive forces. Key Opportunities and Investments We see significant opportunities for growth by investing research and development resources in the following areas: Digital work and life experiences. Our cloud operating system. Our devices operating system and hardware. With investments in these areas, we work to fulfill the evolving needs of our customers in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. We view mobility broadly â not just by devices, but by experiences. Today, people move just as quickly into new contexts as to new locations. Mobility goes beyond devices users carry with them as they move from place to place, to encompass the rich collection of data, applications, and services that accompany them as they move from setting to setting in their lives. Many of our customers are &ldquo;dual users,&rdquo; employing technology for work or school and also deeply in their personal lives. Digital work and life experiences We believe we can significantly enhance the digital lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication, productivity, and information services. We work to deliver digital work and life experiences that are reinvented for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. Productivity will be the first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We will design applications as dual use with the intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each person&rsquo;s privacy choices. The foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, and business process tools including Skype, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Bing, and Dynamics. We see opportunity in combining these services in new ways that are more contextual and personal, while ensuring people, rather than their devices, remain at the center of the digital experience. We will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own. As people move from device to device, so will their content and the richness of their services. We will engineer applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways. Cloud operating system Today, businesses face important opportunities and challenges. Enterprises are asked to deploy technology that advances business strategy. They decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, or connect with customers in new and compelling ways. They work to unlock business insights from a world of data. They rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity, and to manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices. To achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities, and we believe we work from a position of strength. The shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale: larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds. The cloud creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving non-differentiating activities to reliable and cost-effective providers. With Azure, we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe the combination of Azure and Windows Server makes us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. We are working to enhance the return on IT investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partner&rsquo;s datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, with the flexibility and scale they desire. Our cloud will also enable richer employee experiences. We enable organizations to securely adopt software-as-a-service applications (both our own and third-party) and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. We will continue to innovate with higher level services including identity and directory services, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web, and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our digital work and life experiences will also be extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. Our strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services, and will bring continued competition with Google, Amazon, and other well-established and emerging competitors. Device operating system and hardware With our Windows device operating system and first-party hardware, we strive to set the standard for productivity experiences. We aim to deliver the richest and most consistent user experience for digital work and life scenarios on screens of all sizes â from phones, tablets, and laptops to TVs and large, multi-touch displays. We are investing to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. We are working to create a broad developer opportunity by enabling universal Windows applications to run across all device targets. We are developing new input/output methods like speech, pen, and gesture to power more personal computing experiences. We work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows devices. We also build first-party hardware to set the standard for productivity experiences and stimulate more demand for the entire Windows ecosystem, as we do with Surface, and with the acquisition of substantially all Nokia Corporation&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Nokia&rdquo;) Devices and Services business (&ldquo;NDS&rdquo;) on April&nbsp;25, 2014, phones. As consumer services and hardware advance, we expect they will continue to better complement one another, connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications, productivity, and entertainment services from Microsoft and our partners and developers. We anticipate many new mobile device categories and we anticipate experiences to emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen sizes. We will invest to be on the forefront of this innovation focusing on dual users and their needs across work and life. With the acquisition of NDS, we expect our effective tax rate to increase as our business mix changes. Our future opportunity There are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward. Our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: Delivering new high-value digital work and digital life experiences to improve how people learn, work, play, and interact with one another. Establishing our Windows platform across the PC, tablet, phone, server, other devices, and the cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market. Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. Developing new devices that have increasingly natural ways to use them, including touch, gesture, and speech. Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command. We believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large, global partner and customer base, our growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user&rsquo;s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. To support our strategy of reinventing productivity to empower every person and every organization to do more and achieve more, we announced a restructuring plan in July 2014. Through this restructuring, we strive to increase agility, streamline engineering processes, move faster and more efficiently, and simplify our organization. Even if we achieve these goals, the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We prioritize our investments among the highest long-term growth opportunities. These investments require significant resources and are multi-year in nature. The products and services we bring to market may be developed internally, as part of a partnership or alliance, or through acquisition. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one&rsquo;s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K. Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding: revenue deferred on certain devices bundled with other products and services (&ldquo;Bundled Offerings&rdquo;); and revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the &ldquo;Windows Upgrade Offer&rdquo;). If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Reportable Segments The segment amounts included in MD&amp;A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and other. Operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. Our reportable segments are described below. On April&nbsp;25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS for total consideration of $ 9.5 billion. This amount was greater than the $ 7.2 billion disclosed previously, primarily due to $ 1.5 billion of cash acquired, foreign currency movements of $ 330 million, working capital adjustments of $ 210 million, and other adjustments of $ 260 million. See Note 9 â Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details. NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&amp;C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&amp;C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Devices and Consumer (&ldquo;D&amp;C&rdquo;) Our D&amp;C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&amp;C segments are: D&amp;C Licensing , comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (&ldquo;Windows OEM&rdquo;) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (&ldquo;Office Consumer&rdquo;); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue; Computing and Gaming Hardware , comprising: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (&ldquo;Xbox Platform&rdquo;); Surface devices and accessories; and Microsoft PC accessories; Phone Hardware , comprising: Lumia Smartphones and other non-Lumia phones, beginning with our acquisition of NDS; and D&amp;C Other , comprising: Resale, including Windows Store, Xbox Live transactions, and Windows Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; our retail stores; and certain other consumer products and services not included in the categories above. Commercial Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user&rsquo;s hardware and software. Our Commercial segments are: Commercial Licensing , comprising: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (&ldquo;CALs&rdquo;); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic (&ldquo;Windows Commercial&rdquo;); Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CALs (&ldquo;Office Commercial&rdquo;); Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; and Skype; and Commercial Other , comprising: Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure; and certain other commercial products and online services not included in the categories above.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) The components of other income (expense) were as follows: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Dividends and interest income $ &nbsp;883 $ &nbsp;677 $ &nbsp;800 Interest expense (597) (429) (380) Net recognized gains on investments 437 116 564 Net losses on derivatives (328) (196) (364) Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements (165) (74) (117) Other (169) 194 1 Total $ 61 $ 288 $ 504 We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (&ldquo;OCI&rdquo;) until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (&ldquo;AOCI&rdquo;) into other income (expense). Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $ 106 million in fiscal year 2014, compared with $ 208 million in fiscal year 2013. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period.

For fiscal year 2013, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixed-income investments, offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our Facebook holding in the prior year, offset in part by lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $ 208 million in fiscal year 2013, compared with $ 298 million in fiscal year 2012. Net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with losses in the prior fiscal year, and lower losses on commodity and foreign exchange derivatives as compared to the prior fiscal year, offset in part by losses on interest-rate derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to gains in the prior fiscal year. For the current year, other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the MSNBC joint venture. INCOME TAXES Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $ 458 million to prior years&rsquo; liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as well as losses incurred by NDS and changes in the geographic mix of our business. This was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily Denmark. Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. Windows PC operating system revenue decreased $ 655 million in fiscal year 2014, while Microsoft Office system and server products and tools revenue increased $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, during this same period. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our U.S. income before income taxes was $ 7.1 billion and $ 6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $ 20.7 billion and $ 20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $ 10.4 billion and $ 9.4 billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years&rsquo; liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our IRS audits. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.&nbsp;Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2013. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19% and 24%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5% from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring $ 6.2 billion non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012. The goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10% in fiscal year 2012. In addition, in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we recognized a reduction of 18% and 21%, respectively, to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1% increase related to the EU fine, which is not tax deductible. Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. Windows PC operating system revenue increased $ 209 million in fiscal year 2013, while Microsoft Office system and server products and tools revenue increased $ 696 million and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, during this same period. In fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our U.S. income before income taxes was $ 6.7 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 25% and 7%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the foreign income before income taxes was $ 20.4 billion and $ 20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 75% and 93%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. The primary driver for the increase in the U.S. income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year. Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were $ 9.4 billion and $ 7.6 billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to transfer pricing, including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily Denmark. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June&nbsp;30, 2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2012. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $ 85.7 billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, compared with $ 77.0 billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2013. Equity and other investments were $ 14.6 billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, compared with $ 10.8 billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2013. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June&nbsp;30, 2014, $ 77.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $ 2.6 billion. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, approximately 84% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 1% were invested in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $ 558 million as of June&nbsp;30, 2014. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $ 619 million and $ 1.3 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during the current fiscal year to $32.2 billion, due mainly to increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, due mainly to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, due mainly to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Cash flows from operations decreased $ 2.8 billion during the current fiscal year to $ 28.8 billion, due mainly to changes in working capital, including increases in inventory and other current assets. Cash used for financing decreased $ 1.3 billion to $ 8.1 billion, due mainly to a $ 3.5 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $ 1.1 billion increase in dividends paid and a $ 982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used in investing decreased $ 975 million to $ 23.8 billion, due mainly to an $ 8.5 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $ 5.8 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, maturities, and sales, and a $ 2.0 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had $ 22.6 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising $ 2.0 billion of short-term debt and $ 20.6 billion of long-term debt. Short-term debt As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had $ 2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. We have a $ 5.0 billion credit facility that expires on November&nbsp;14, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented. Long-term debt As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $ 20.6 billion and $ 21.5 billion, respectively. These estimated fair values are based on Level&nbsp;2 inputs. The components of our long-term debt and the associated interest rates were as follows as of June&nbsp;30, 2014: Due Date Face Value Stated Interest Rate Effective Interest Rate &nbsp; &nbsp; (In&nbsp;millions) &nbsp; Notes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; September&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2015 $ 1,750 1.625% 1.795% February&nbsp;8, 2016 750 2.500% 2.642% November&nbsp;15, 2017 600 0.875% 1.084% May&nbsp;1, 2018 450 1.000% 1.106% December&nbsp;6, 2018&nbsp;(a) 1,250 1.625% 1.824% June&nbsp;1, 2019 1,000 4.200% 4.379% October&nbsp;1, 2020 1,000 3.000% 3.137% February&nbsp;8, 2021 500 4.000% 4.082% December&nbsp;6, 2021&nbsp;(b) 2,396 2.125% 2.233% November&nbsp;15, 2022 750 2.125% 2.239% May&nbsp;1, 2023 1,000 2.375% 2.465% December&nbsp;15, 2023&nbsp;(a) 1,500 3.625% 3.726% December&nbsp;6, 2028&nbsp;(b) 2,396 3.125% 3.218% May&nbsp;2, 2033&nbsp;(c) 753 2.625% 2.690% June&nbsp;1, 2039 750 5.200% 5.240% October&nbsp;1, 2040 1,000 4.500% 4.567% February&nbsp;8, 2041 1,000 5.300% 5.361% November&nbsp;15, 2042 900 3.500% 3.571% May&nbsp;1, 2043 500 3.750% 3.829% December&nbsp;15, 2043&nbsp;(a) 500 4.875% 4.918% Total $ 20,745 &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) In December 2013, we issued $ 3.3 billion of debt securities. (b) In December 2013, we issued â¬3.5 billion of debt securities. (c) In April 2013, we issued â¬550&nbsp;million of debt securities. The notes in this table are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term debt was $ 100 million. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue at June&nbsp;30, 2014 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue at June&nbsp;30, 2014 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox Live subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Office 365 subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June&nbsp;30, 2014: (In millions) &nbsp; Three Months Ending, &nbsp; September&nbsp;30, 2014 $ 8,667 December&nbsp;31, 2014 7,380 March&nbsp;31, 2015 4,812 June&nbsp;30, 2015 2,291 Thereafter 2,008 Total $ 25,158 Share Repurchases On September&nbsp;16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share repurchase program became effective on October&nbsp;1, 2013, has no expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, $ 35.1 billion remained of the $ 40.0 billion share repurchase program. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175&nbsp;million shares of Microsoft common stock for $ 6.4 billion; 128&nbsp;million shares were repurchased for $ 4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September&nbsp;16, 2013 and 47&nbsp;million shares were repurchased for $ 1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September&nbsp;22, 2008 and expired September&nbsp;30, 2013. During fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 158&nbsp;million shares for $ 4.6 billion and 142&nbsp;million shares for $ 4.0 billion, respectively, under the share repurchase program announced on September&nbsp;22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Dividends During fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends: Declaration Date Dividend Per&nbsp;Share Record&nbsp;Date Total&nbsp;Amount Payment&nbsp;Date &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (In&nbsp;millions) &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2014 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; September&nbsp;16, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.28 November&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;2,332 December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2013 November&nbsp;19, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.28 February 20, 2014 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;2,322 March 13, 2014 March&nbsp;11, 2014 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.28 May 15, 2014 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;2,309 June 12, 2014 June&nbsp;10, 2014 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.28 August 21, 2014 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;2,307 September&nbsp;11, 2014 Fiscal Year 2013 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; September&nbsp;18, 2012 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.23 November&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2012 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;1,933 December&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2012 November&nbsp;28, 2012 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.23 February 21, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;1,925 March 14, 2013 March&nbsp;11, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.23 May 16, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;1,921 June 13, 2013 June&nbsp;12, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;0.23 August 15, 2013 $ &nbsp;&nbsp;1,916 September&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2013 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June&nbsp;30, 2014: (In millions) 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 Thereafter Total Long-term debt:&nbsp; (a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Principal payments $ 0 $ 2,500 $ 3,300 $ 14,945 $ 20,745 Interest payments 566 1,069 1,015 6,110 8,760 Construction commitments&nbsp; (b) 880 0 0 0 880 Operating leases&nbsp; (c) 878 1,419 1,054 1,063 4,414 Purchase commitments&nbsp; (d) 12,995 969 657 153 14,774 Other long-term liabilities&nbsp; (e) 0 354 80 393 827 Total contractual obligations $ 15,319 $ 6,311 $ 6,106 $ 22,664 $ 50,400 (a)Â Â Â See Note 12 â Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements. (b) Â Â These amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements. (c) Â Â These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. (d)Â Â Â These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (e) Â Â We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $ 13.3 billion from the amounts presented. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Liquidity We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates. RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity&rsquo;s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. We adopted this new guidance beginning July&nbsp;1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of Note 5 â Derivatives of the Notes to Financial Statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of AOCI. This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. We adopted this new guidance beginning July&nbsp;1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of Note 19 â Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of the Notes to Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parent&rsquo;s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July&nbsp;1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July&nbsp;1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&rsquo;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (&ldquo;Software Assurance&rdquo;) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (&ldquo;PCS&rdquo;) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)&nbsp;vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (&ldquo;VSOE&rdquo;), (ii)&nbsp;third-party evidence, and (iii)&nbsp;best estimate of selling price (&ldquo;ESP&rdquo;). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the Windows Upgrade Offer, which started June&nbsp;2, 2012. The offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase Windows 8 Pro to qualifying end-users that purchased Windows 7 PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft was responsible for delivering Windows 8 Pro to the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered Windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired. Impairment of Investment Securities We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill, resulting from the acquisition of NDS, is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long-term financial forecast for the business.&nbsp;In this highly competitive and volatile market, it is possible that we may not realize our forecasts. Given the value assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation, we will closely monitor the performance of the business versus the long-term forecast to determine if any impairments arise. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&rsquo;s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management&rsquo;s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E. Hood Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Frank H. Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer MARKET RISK QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use &ldquo;To Be Announced&rdquo; forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk.&nbsp;We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. VALUE-AT-RISK We use a value-at-risk (&ldquo;VaR&rdquo;) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013 and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2014: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; June&nbsp;30, 2014 June&nbsp;30, 2013 Year Ended June 30, 2014 Risk Categories &nbsp; &nbsp; Average High Low Foreign currency $ 179 $ 199 $ 215 $ 287 $ 117 Interest rate $ 73 $ 85 $ 82 $ 91 $ 73 Equity $ 176 $ 181 $ 208 $ Â 246 $ Â 173 Commodity $ 17 $ 19 $ 18 $ 21 $ 16 Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $ 333 million at June&nbsp;30, 2014 and $ 350 million at June&nbsp;30, 2013. The total VaR is 25% less at June&nbsp;30, 2014, and 28% less at June&nbsp;30, 2013, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. &nbsp; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA INCOME STATEMENTS (In millions, except per share amounts) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Revenue $ 86,833 $ 77,849 $ 73,723 Cost of revenue 26,934 20,249 17,530 Gross margin 59,899 57,600 56,193 Research and development 11,381 10,411 9,811 Sales and marketing 15,811 15,276 13,857 General and administrative 4,821 5,149 4,569 Goodwill impairment 0 0 6,193 Integration and restructuring 127 0 0 Operating income 27,759 26,764 21,763 Other income, net 61 288 504 Income before income taxes 27,820 27,052 22,267 Provision for income taxes 5,746 5,189 5,289 Net income $ 22,074 $ Â 21,863 $ 16,978 Earnings per share: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basic $ 2.66 $ 2.61 $ 2.02 Diluted $ 2.63 $ 2.58 $ 2.00 Weighted average shares outstanding: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basic 8,299 8,375 8,396 Diluted 8,399 8,470 8,506 Cash dividends declared per common share $ 1.12 $ 0.92 $ 0.80 See accompanying notes.

NOTES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 â ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;U.S. GAAP&rdquo;). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee&rsquo;s activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management&rsquo;s estimates and assumptions. Recasting of Certain Prior Period Information During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments described in Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. This change impacted Note 10 â Goodwill, Note 14 â Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (&ldquo;OCI&rdquo;) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i)&nbsp;vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (&ldquo;VSOE&rdquo;), (ii)&nbsp;third-party evidence, and (iii)&nbsp;best estimate of selling price (&ldquo;ESP&rdquo;). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (&ldquo;OEMs&rdquo;), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available. Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by management. Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (&ldquo;PCS&rdquo;) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products (&ldquo;Software Assurance&rdquo;), which we have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources. Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing. Revenue related to phones, Surface, Xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (&ldquo;traffic acquisition costs&rdquo;); costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs. Capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90&nbsp;days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 2.3 billion, $ 2.6 billion, and $ 1.6 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The deferred income taxes are classified as current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.&nbsp;We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: Level 1 â inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds.&nbsp;Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. Level 2 â inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. Level 3 â inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management&rsquo;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock and goodwill when it is recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.&nbsp;Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Financial Instruments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Held-to-maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (&ldquo;AOCI&rdquo;) into other income (expense). Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Balance, beginning of period $ 336 $ 389 $ 333 Charged to costs and other 16 4 115 Write-offs (51) (57) (59) Balance, end of period $ 301 $ Â 336 $ Â 389 Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangible Assets All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Recently adopted accounting guidance In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity&rsquo;s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. We adopted this new guidance beginning July&nbsp;1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of Note 5 â Derivatives. In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of AOCI. This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements) the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. We adopted this new guidance beginning July&nbsp;1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of Note 19 â Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parent&rsquo;s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning July&nbsp;1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July&nbsp;1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact, and we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 â Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 22,074 $ 21,863 $ 16,978 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 8,299 8,375 8,396 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 100 95 110 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 8,399 8,470 8,506 Earnings Per Share &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basic (A/B) $ 2.66 $ 2.61 $ 2.02 Diluted (A/C) $ 2.63 $ 2.58 $ 2.00 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.

These corporate notes are classified as held-to-maturity investments and are included in equity and other investments on the balance sheet.&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.5 billion, and $ 1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrecognized holding gains were $ 164 million. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $ 520 million and $ 395 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. Unrealized Losses on Investments Investments, excluding those held-to-maturity, with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: &nbsp; Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater &nbsp; &nbsp; (In millions) Fair&nbsp;Value Unrealized Losses Fair&nbsp;Value Unrealized Losses Total Fair&nbsp;Value Total Unrealized Losses June&nbsp;30, 2014 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; U.S. government and agency securities $ Â 4,161 $ Â (29) $ 850 $ 0 $ Â 5,011 $ (29) Foreign government bonds 566 (4) 21 (6) 587 (10) Mortgage-backed securities 120 0 61 (2) 181 (2) Corporate notes and bonds 1,154 (8) 34 (1) 1,188 (9) Common and preferred stock 463 (48) 257 (33) 720 (81) Total $ 6,464 $ (89) $ 1,223 $ (42) $ 7,687 $ (131) &nbsp; &nbsp; Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater &nbsp; &nbsp; (In millions) Fair&nbsp;Value Unrealized Losses Fair&nbsp;Value Unrealized Losses Total Fair&nbsp;Value Total Unrealized Losses June&nbsp;30, 2013 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; U.S. government and agency securities $ Â 2,208 $ (84) $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,208 $ (84) Foreign government bonds 589 (18) 69 (23) 658 (41) Mortgage-backed securities 357 (12) 39 (1) 396 (13) Corporate notes and bonds 1,142 (38) 27 (2) 1,169 (40) Municipal securities 44 (1) 0 0 44 (1) Common and preferred stock 1,166 (168) 409 (113) 1,575 (281) Total $ 5,506 $ (321) $ 544 $ (139) $ 6,050 $ (460) As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we did not hold any held-to-maturity investments that are in an unrealized loss position. Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June&nbsp;30, 2014.

NOTE 5 â Derivatives We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $ 4.9 billion and $ 5.1 billion, respectively. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $ 3.1 billion and $ 407 million, respectively. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $ 6.2 billion and $ 8.5 billion, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $ 5.0 billion and $ 7.9 billion, respectively. Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk.&nbsp;Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $ 3.1 billion and $ 2.1 billion, respectively, of which $ 362 million and $ 420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As of June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $ 898 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, none of which were designated as hedging instruments. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $ 503 million and $ 741 million, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $ 1.1 billion and $ 809 million, respectively. In addition, we use &ldquo;To Be Announced&rdquo; forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.&nbsp;These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $ 412 million and $ 440 million, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $ 377 million and $ 501 million, respectively. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $ 1.4 billion and $ 408 million, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $ 1.2 billion and $ 249 million, respectively. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following tables present the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments (&ldquo;designated hedge derivatives&rdquo;) and not designated as hedging instruments (&ldquo;non-designated hedge derivatives&rdquo;). The fair values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk: --> &nbsp; June&nbsp;30, 2014 June&nbsp;30, 2013 &nbsp; Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities (In millions) Short-term Investments Other Current Assets Equity&nbsp;and Other Investments Other Current Liabilities Short-term Investments Other Current Assets Other Current Liabilities Non-designated Hedge Derivatives &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Foreign exchange contracts $ &nbsp;&nbsp;10 $ 39 $ Â &nbsp;0 $ (97) $ 41 $ 87 $ (63) Equity contracts 177 0 0 (21) 157 0 (9) Interest rate contracts 17 0 0 (12) 18 0 (45) Credit contracts 24 0 0 (13) 19 0 (17) Commodity contracts 15 0 0 (1) 3 0 (1) Total $ 243 $ 39 $ 0 $ (144) $ 238 $ 87 $ (135) Designated Hedge Derivatives &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Foreign exchange contracts $ 1 $ 70 $ 0 $ (15) $ 9 $ 167 $ 0 Equity contracts 0 0 7 (125) 0 0 0 Total $ 1 $ 70 $ 7 $ Â (140) $ 9 $ Â 167 $ 0 Total gross amounts of derivatives $ 244 $ 109 $ 7 $ Â (284) $ 247 $ 254 $ (135) Gross derivatives either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting agreement $ 99 $ 109 $ 7 $ Â (284) $ Â 105 $ Â 254 $ (97) Gross amounts offset in the balance sheet (77) (71) (7) Â &nbsp;155 (72) (9) 80 Net amounts presented in the balance sheet $ 22 $ 38 $ 0 $ Â (129) $ 33 $ Â 245 $ (17) Gross amounts not offset in the balance sheet 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Net amount $ 22 $ 38 $ 0 $ Â (129) $ 33 $ Â 245 $ (17) See also Note 4 â Investments and Note&nbsp;6&nbsp;â Fair Value Measurements.

No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2014. Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses) Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense).

In connection with the transaction to acquire substantially all of Nokia Corporation&rsquo;s (&ldquo;Nokia&rdquo;) Devices and Services Business (&ldquo;NDS&rdquo;), on September&nbsp;23, 2013 we provided Nokia â¬1.5 billion ( $ 2.1 billion) principal of convertible notes classified as Level 3 financial instruments. Upon closing of the acquisition, Nokia repurchased these notes at their principal amount plus accrued interest. All other changes in our Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis were immaterial during the periods presented.

NOTE 9 â Business Combinations Nokia&rsquo;s Devices and Services Business On April&nbsp;25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all of NDS for a total purchase price of $ 9.5 billion, including cash acquired of $ 1.5 billion (&ldquo;the Acquisition&rdquo;). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $ 7.1 billion and Nokia&rsquo;s repurchase of convertible notes of $ 2.1 billion which was a non-cash transaction. The Acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of our Devices and Consumer (&ldquo;D&amp;C&rdquo;) business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing. The purchase price allocation as of the date of the Acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed become available. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows: (In millions) Cash $ Â 1,503 Accounts receivable&nbsp;(a) 754 Inventories 544 Other current assets 960 Property and equipment 981 Intangible assets 4,509 Goodwill&nbsp;(b) 5,458 Other 249 Current liabilities (4,576) Long-term liabilities (917) Total purchase price $ &nbsp;9,465 (a) Gross accounts receivable is $ 901 million, of which $ 147 million is expected to be uncollectible. (b) Goodwill was assigned to our new Phone Hardware segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of NDS. Goodwill of $ 4.5 billion is expected to be deductible in Finland for tax purposes. Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: (In millions) Amount Weighted Average&nbsp;Life Technology-based $ 2,493 9&nbsp;years Contract-based 1,500 9&nbsp;years Customer-related 359 3&nbsp;years Marketing-related (trade names) 157 2&nbsp;years Fair value of intangible assets acquired $ Â 4,509 8&nbsp;years Our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 includes revenue and operating loss of $ 2.0 billion and $ 692 million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition. Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been consummated on July&nbsp;1, 2012: (In millions, except per share amounts) &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 Revenue $ 96,248 $ 93,243 Net income $ 20,234 $ 20,153 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41 $ 2.38 These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $ 21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in Integration and restructuring costs on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014. Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed to license Nokia&rsquo;s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as they are rendered. Yammer On July&nbsp;18, 2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc. (&ldquo;Yammer&rdquo;), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $ 1.1 billion in cash. Yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to Microsoft&rsquo;s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $ 937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $ 178 million. We assigned the goodwill to Commercial Other under our current segment structure. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date. Skype On October&nbsp;13, 2011, we acquired Skype Global S.Ã¡ r.l. (&ldquo;Skype&rdquo;), a leading global provider of software applications and related Internet communications products based in Luxembourg, for $ 8.6 billion, primarily in cash. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $ 7.1 billion, identifiable intangible assets of $ 1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $ 222 million. The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to our expectation of extending Skype&rsquo;s brand and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing Microsoft&rsquo;s existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. We assigned the goodwill to the following segments under our current segment structure: $ 5.6 billion to Commercial Licensing, $ 1.4 billion to Computing and Gaming Hardware, and $ 54 million to D&amp;C Other. Skype was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date. Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: (In millions) &nbsp; Weighted Average&nbsp;Life Marketing-related (trade names) $ 1,249 15&nbsp;years Technology-based 275 5 years Customer-related 114 5 years Contract-based 10 4 years Total $ 1,648 13 years Other During fiscal year 2014, we completed five additional acquisitions for total consideration of $ 140 million, all of which was paid in cash. These entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. With the exception of NDS, pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the business combinations described in this note, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.

See Note 9 â Business Combinations for additional details. The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions occurred. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as &ldquo;Other&rdquo; in the above table. Also included in &ldquo;Other&rdquo; are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. As discussed in Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. This resulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May&nbsp;1 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No impairment of goodwill was identified as of May&nbsp;1, 2014 or May&nbsp;1, 2013. Upon completion of the fiscal year 2012 test, the goodwill of our OSD unit (in Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure) was determined to be impaired. The impairment was the result of the OSD unit experiencing slower than projected growth in search queries and search advertising revenue per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the timing and implementation of certain initiatives designed to drive search and display revenue growth in the future. This goodwill impairment charge of $ 6.2 billion also represented our accumulated goodwill impairment as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013.

Short-term Debt As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. We have a $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on November&nbsp;14, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented. Long-term Debt As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, of $ 15.6 billion and $ 15.8 billion, respectively, as of June&nbsp;30, 2013.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $ 92.9 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $ 29.6 billion at June&nbsp;30, 2014. Income taxes paid were $ 5.5 billion, $ 3.9 billion, and $ 3.5 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions Unrecognized tax benefits as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, were $ 8.7 billion, $ 8.6 billion, and $ 7.2 billion, respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, by $ 7.0 billion, $ 6.5 billion, and $ 6.2 billion, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 939 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $ 235 million, $ 400 million, and $ 154 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Balance, beginning of year $ 8,648 $ 7,202 $ 6,935 Decreases related to settlements (583) (30) (16) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 566 612 481 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 217 931 118 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (95) (65) (292) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations (39) (2) (24) Balance, end of year $ 8,714 $ Â 8,648 $ 7,202 During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $ 461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.&nbsp;Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2013. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 14 â Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue by segment was as follows, with segments with significant balances shown separately: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 Commercial Licensing $ 19,099 $ 18,460 Commercial Other 3,934 2,272 Rest of the segments 2,125 1,667 Total $ 25,158 $ 22,399 &nbsp; NOTE 15 â Other Long-Term Liabilities (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities $ 10,510 $ 9,548 Other 1,084 452 Total $ 11,594 $ 10,000 NOTE 16 â Commitments and Guarantees Construction and Operating Leases We have committed $ 880 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June&nbsp;30, 2014. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, and certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases was $ 874 million, $ 711 million, and $ 639 million, in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 are as follows: (In millions) &nbsp; Year Ending June&nbsp;30, &nbsp; 2015 $ 878 2016 748 2017 671 2018 598 2019 456 Thereafter 1,063 Total $ 4,414 Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 17 â Contingencies Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the United States. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. We estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $400 million, all of which had been accrued as of June&nbsp;30, 2014. Three similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been settled. In March 2010, the court in the British Columbia case certified it as a class action. The plaintiffs successfully appealed a British Columbia Court of Appeal decision reversing class certification and dismissing the case. In October 2013, the Canadian Supreme Court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the British Columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in September 2015. The other two cases were inactive pending action by the Supreme Court on the British Columbia case. Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims Novell litigation In November 2004, Novell, Inc. (&ldquo;Novell&rdquo;) filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (later transferred to federal court in Maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell&rsquo;s ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. After the trial court dismissed or granted summary judgment on a number of Novell&rsquo;s claims, trial of the one remaining claim took place in late 2011 and resulted in a mistrial. In July 2012, the trial court granted Microsoft&rsquo;s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Novell appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the trial court&rsquo;s decision in September 2013. The Supreme Court denied Novell&rsquo;s petition for review in April 2014. Go Computer litigation In June 2005, GO Computer Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a complaint in California state court asserting antitrust claims under the Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in interest, Lucent Corporation in the early 2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. After a mini-trial on standing issues, the case is now moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for September 2015. China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation On July 28, 2014, Microsoft was informed that China&rsquo;s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) had begun a formal investigation relating to China&rsquo;s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification issues related to Windows and Office software. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims Motorola litigation In October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola Mobility (&ldquo;Motorola&rdquo;) with the International Trade Commission (&ldquo;ITC&rdquo;) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorola&rsquo;s Android devices. Since then, Microsoft and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the ITC, in federal district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany and the United Kingdom. The nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below. International Trade Commission In May 2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent, which became effective in July&nbsp;2012 and was affirmed on appeal in December 2013. In July 2013, Microsoft filed an action in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the ITC&rsquo;s May 2012 import ban against infringing Motorola products by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (&ldquo;CBP&rdquo;), after learning that CBP had failed to fully enforce the order. In November 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing Xbox products. At Motorola&rsquo;s request, the ITC terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In March 2013, the ITC affirmed there was no violation of the remaining Motorola patent. Motorola appealed the ITC&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. U.S. District Court The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsoft&rsquo;s ITC case against Motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the ITC case. In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (&ldquo;RAND&rdquo;) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case described above and in suits described below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In February 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling that (1)&nbsp;Motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms and conditions; and (2)&nbsp;Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District Court set per unit royalties for Motorola&rsquo;s H.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft liability. In September 2013, following trial of Microsoft&rsquo;s breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to Microsoft. Motorola appealed. Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in Wisconsin (a companion case to Motorola&rsquo;s ITC action), have been transferred to the U.S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these cases on agreement of the parties. In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by a range of Microsoft products including mobile and PC operating system, productivity, server, communication, browser and gaming products. In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection with Microsoft&rsquo;s assertion of patents against Motorola that Microsoft agreed to license to certain qualifying entities on RAND terms and conditions. In counterclaims, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola digital video recorders. Germany In July 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries. Motorola asserts two patents (one now expired) are essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. In May 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable Microsoft products in Germany, which Microsoft appealed. Orders in the litigation pending in Seattle, Washington described above enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction. Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. In April 2013, the court stayed the case pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is seeking to invalidate the patent. In November 2013, the Federal Patent Court invalidated the originally issued patent claims, but ruled that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and Microsoft appealed. In June 2014, the court reopened infringement proceedings and scheduled a hearing in November 2014. Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any injunction by altering its products to avoid Motorola&rsquo;s infringement claims. Any damages would be determined in separate proceedings. In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued injunctions on three of the Microsoft patents, which Motorola appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending. In actions filed separately by Motorola to invalidate these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the cases in which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to prevail following all appeals, Motorola could have a claim against Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction. United Kingdom In December 2011, Microsoft filed an action against Motorola in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, in London, England, seeking to revoke the UK part of the European patent asserted by Motorola in Germany against the ActiveSync protocol. In February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2012, the court ruled that Motorola&rsquo;s patent is invalid. The court also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in Google&rsquo;s ActiveSync license. Motorola appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s ruling in Microsoft&rsquo;s favor in November 2013. Motorola has exhausted all appeals and the rulings in Microsoft&rsquo;s favor are final. IPCom patent litigation IPCom GmbH&nbsp;&amp; Co. is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. Three of the infringement suits against Nokia (now assumed by Microsoft through the NDS acquisition) are still pending in courts in Germany, England, and Italy. These courts have held a number of IPCom&rsquo;s patents were invalid or not infringed. We continue to contest the validity or infringement of the patents remaining in dispute. Interdigital patent litigation InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, &ldquo;IDT&rdquo;) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We are being substituted for Nokia in these cases. Each case includes other co-defendants because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The suite of cases include three ITC investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. European copyright levies We have assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia&rsquo;s alleged failure to pay &ldquo;private copying levies&rdquo; in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.&nbsp;The levies are based upon a 2001 EU Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying.&nbsp;Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.&nbsp;The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries.&nbsp;We are litigating against certain collecting societies on the basis that the levy schemes exceed what the EU Directive and European Court of Justice decisions permit. Other patent and intellectual property claims In addition to these cases, there are approximately 90 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft. Product-Related Litigation U.S. cell phone litigation Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS acquisition. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining ten cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (&ldquo;FCC Guidelines&rdquo;) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs&rsquo; expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. The motion was heard in December 2013 and January 2014. In March 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs&rsquo; general causation testimony on the ground that it is pre-empted by federal law because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets, including those that comply with the FCC Guidelines. Both motions are pending. Canadian cell phone class action Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served. Other We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management&rsquo;s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $780 million in other current liabilities and $81 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. Substantially all changes from the prior quarter in these accruals and estimates are attributable to matters involving Nokia that we assumed as a result of the NDS acquisition.

At June&nbsp;30, 2014, an aggregate of 346&nbsp;million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and leadership stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our stock plans. Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Stock-based compensation expense $ 2,446 $ 2,406 $ 2,244 Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation $ 830 $ 842 $ 785 Stock Plans Stock awards Stock awards (&ldquo;SAs&rdquo;) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. SAs generally vest over a four or five-year period. Executive incentive plan Under the Executive Incentive Plan (&ldquo;EIP&rdquo;), the Compensation Committee awards performance-based compensation comprising both cash and SAs to executive officers and certain senior executives. For executive officers, their awards are based on an aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. For fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, the pool was 0.44%, 0.35%, and 0.30% of operating income, respectively. The SAs vest ratably in August of each of the four years following the grant date. The final cash awards will be determined after each performance period based on individual and business performance. Activity for all stock plans The fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Dividends per share (quarterly amounts) $0.23&nbsp;-&nbsp;$0.28 $0.20&nbsp;-&nbsp;$0.23 $0.16&nbsp;-&nbsp;$0.20 Interest rates range 1.3%&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.8% 0.6%&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.1% 0.7%&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.7% During fiscal year 2014, the following activity occurred under our stock plans: Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In&nbsp;millions) &nbsp; Stock Awards &nbsp; &nbsp; Nonvested balance, beginning of year 273 $ 25.50 Granted&nbsp;(a) 103 $ 31.50 Vested (93) $ 25.12 Forfeited (24) $ 27.01 Nonvested balance, end of year 259 $ 27.88 (a)Â Â Â Includes four million shares in stock replacement awards related to the acquisition of NDS. The weighted average grant-date fair value was $ 37.64. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, there was approximately $5.2 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years. During fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the following activity occurred under our stock plans: (In millions, except fair values) 2013 2012 Stock Awards &nbsp; &nbsp; Awards granted 104 110 Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 28.37 $ 24.60 Total vest-date fair value of stock awards vested was $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.4 billion, for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an employee stock purchase plan (the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;) for all eligible employees. Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented: (Shares in millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 2013 2012 Shares purchased 18 20 20 Average price per share $ 33.60 $ 26.81 $ 25.03 At June&nbsp;30, 2014, 173&nbsp;million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the Plan. Savings Plan We have a savings plan in the U.S. that qualifies under Section&nbsp;401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant&rsquo;s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given year. Matching contributions for all plans were $ 420 million, $ 393 million, and $ 373 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant&rsquo;s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock. NOTE 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information in this note is reported on that basis. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments; D&amp;C Licensing, D&amp;C Hardware, D&amp;C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. On April&nbsp;25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 9 â Business Combinations for additional details. NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&amp;C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&amp;C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Our reportable segments are described below. Devices and Consumer Our D&amp;C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&amp;C segments are: D&amp;C Licensing , comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (&ldquo;Windows OEM&rdquo;) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (&ldquo;Office Consumer&rdquo;); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue; Computing and Gaming Hardware , comprising: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (&ldquo;Xbox Platform&rdquo;); Surface devices and accessories; and Microsoft PC accessories; Phone Hardwar e , comprising: Lumia Smartphones and other non-Lumia phones, beginning with the acquisition of NDS; and D&amp;C Other , comprising: Resale, including Windows Store, Xbox Live transactions, and Windows Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; our retail stores; and certain other consumer products and services not included in the categories above. Commercial Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user&rsquo;s hardware and software. Our Commercial segments are: Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (&ldquo;CALs&rdquo;); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic (&ldquo;Windows Commercial&rdquo;); Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CALs (&ldquo;Office Commercial&rdquo;); Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; and Skype; and Commercial Other, comprising: Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure; and certain other commercial products and online services not included in the categories above. Revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. Cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology. We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the cloud. Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows: Sales and marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment. Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group. General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and integration and restructuring costs. Segment revenue and gross margin were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, &nbsp; 2014 2013 2012 Revenue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Devices and Consumer Licensing $ 18,803 $ 19,021 $ 19,495 &nbsp; Hardware: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Computing and Gaming Hardware 9,628 6,461 6,740 &nbsp; Phone Hardware 1,985 0 0 &nbsp; Total D&amp;C Hardware 11,613 6,461 6,740 &nbsp; Other 7,258 6,618 6,203 &nbsp; Total Devices and Consumer 37,674 32,100 32,438 Commercial Licensing 42,027 39,686 37,126 &nbsp; Other 7,547 5,660 4,644 &nbsp; Total Commercial 49,574 45,346 41,770 Corporate and Other &nbsp; (415) 403 (485) Total revenue &nbsp; $ 86,833 $ 77,849 $ 73,723 (In millions) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year Ended June&nbsp;30, &nbsp; 2014 2013 2012 Gross margin &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Devices and Consumer Licensing $ 17,216 $ 17,044 $ 17,240 &nbsp; Hardware: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Computing and Gaming Hardware 893 956 2,495 &nbsp; Phone Hardware 54 0 0 &nbsp; Total D&amp;C Hardware 947 956 2,495 &nbsp; Other 1,770 2,046 1,998 &nbsp; Total Devices and Consumer 19,933 20,046 21,733 Commercial Licensing 38,604 36,261 34,463 &nbsp; Other 1,856 921 579 &nbsp; Total Commercial 40,460 37,182 35,042 Corporate and Other &nbsp; (494) 372 (582) Total gross margin &nbsp; $ 59,899 $ Â 57,600 $ Â 56,193 Following is operating expenses by segment group.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&nbsp;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.&nbsp;An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.&nbsp;An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July&nbsp;31, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. /S/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DELOITTE&nbsp;&amp; TOUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July&nbsp;31, 2014 &nbsp; CONTROLS &amp; PROCEDURES CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Nokia Corporation&rsquo;s Devices and Services business, acquired on April&nbsp;25, 2014, which is included in our 2014 consolidated financial statements and represented approximately 9% of our total assets as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, and 2% of our total revenues for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2014. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June&nbsp;30, 2014. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2014; their report follows. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation Redmond, Washington We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.&nbsp;As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Nokia Corporation&rsquo;s Devices and Services business, acquired on April&nbsp;25, 2014 and whose financial statements constitute 9% of total assets as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2% of total revenues for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2014. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Nokia Corporation&rsquo;s Devices and Services business. The Company&rsquo;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.&nbsp;Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&nbsp;Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.&nbsp;Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.&nbsp;We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company&rsquo;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company&rsquo;s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp;A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.&nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control â Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, of the Company and our report dated July&nbsp;31, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /S/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DELOITTE&nbsp;&amp; TOUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July&nbsp;31, 2014 Directors & Officers Directors John W.
