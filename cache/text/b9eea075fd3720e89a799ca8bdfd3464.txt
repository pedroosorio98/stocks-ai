Profitability $1.6B GAAP operating income in Q2 after restructuring and other charges of $0.6B $1.5B GAAP net income in Q2 $1.8B non-GAAP net income 1 in Q2 In Q2, we achieved record quarterly revenues despite a difficult operating environment. The Energy Storage business continues to grow rapidly, setting a record in Q2 with 9.4 GWh of deployments, resulting in record revenues and gross profits for the overall segment. We also saw a sequential rebound in vehicle deliveries in Q2 as overall consumer sentiment improved and we launched attractive financing options to offset the impact of sustained high interest rates. We recognized record regulatory credit revenues in Q2 as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements. Global EV penetration returned to growth in Q2 and is taking share from ICE vehicles. We believe that a pure EV is the optimal vehicle design and will ultimately win over consumers as the myths on range, charging and service are debunked. Progress continued for our AI initiatives in Q2. We reduced the price of FSD (Supervised) 4 in North America and launched free trials to everyone with the necessary hardware. These programs have demonstrated success and are laying the foundation for more meaningful FSD monetization. We expect to see an increase in FSD attach rates for our fleet as the capability improves and we increase awareness of the convenience and safety it offers users. Overall, our focus remains on company -wide cost reduction, including reducing COGS per vehicle, growing our traditional hardware business and accelerating development of our AI - enabled products and services. Though timing of Robotaxi deployment depends on technological advancement and regulatory approval, we are working vigorously on this opportunity given the outsized potential value. Concurrently, we are managing our product portfolio with a long -term orientation and focusing on growing sales, maximizing our installed base and generating sufficient cash flow to invest in future growth.

YoY, revenue was impacted by the following items: + growth in the Energy Generation and Storage business + Cybertruck deliveries + higher regulatory credit revenue + growth in Services and Other - reduced S3XY vehicle average selling price (ASP) (excl. FX impact), due to pricing, attractive financing options and mix - decline in S3XY vehicle deliveries - negative FX impact of $0.3B 1 Profitability Our operating income decreased YoY to $1.6B in Q2, resulting in a 6.3% operating margin. YoY, operating income was primarily impacted by the following items: - reduced S3XY vehicle ASP as noted above - restructuring charges - increase in operating expenses largely driven by AI projects - decline in S3XY vehicle deliveries + higher regulatory credit revenue + growth in Energy Generation and Storage gross profit + lower cost per vehicle, including lower raw material costs, freight and duties + lower cost of production ramp of 4680 cells and other related charges Cash Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and investments in Q2 was $30.7B. The sequential increase of $3.9B was a result of positive free cash flow of $1.3B, driven by an inventory decrease of $1.8B and partially offset by AI infrastructure capex of $0.6B in Q2. 5 (1)Impact is calculated on a constant currency basis.

Market share of Tesla vehicles by region (TTM) Source: Tesla estimates based on latest available data from ACEA; Autonews.com; CAAM – light-duty vehicles only; TTM = Trailing twelve months 1 IRA = Inflation Reduction Act We continued to add to our vehicle lineup globally, including the introduction of new Model 3 and Model Y trims and additional paint options for the S3XY lineup. After a sequential decline in production in Q2, we expect a sequential increase in production in Q3. US: California, Nevada and Texas Refreshed Model 3 ramp continued successfully, including the introduction of Model 3 Performance in Q2 and Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive in July. We also continue to qualify more Model 3 trims for the IRA 1 Tax Credit. Cybertruck production more than tripled sequentially and remains on track to achieve profitability by end of year. Preparation of Semi factory continues and is on track to begin production by end of 2025. China: Shanghai We significantly increased deliveries in several markets supplied by Gigafactory Shanghai in Q2, including South Korea. While the automotive market in China remains among the most competitive globally, we feel that our cost structure and focus on core functionality that drives value for customers – including autonomy – position us well for the long -term. Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg In Q2, Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg began producing vehicles for right -hand drive markets and delivered its first units to the U.K. We also began delivering vehicles to Qatar, while increasing deliveries to Israel and Taiwan. Our regional production strategy provides flexibility as needs change across markets. 7 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% US/Canada Europe China Tesla AI training capacity ramp through end of year (H100 equivalent GPUs) C O R E T E C H N O L O G Y Cumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised) (billions) Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware In Q2, we focused on reducing interventions with FSD (Supervised) 1, while improving driving comfort. Notably, we rolled out a version of FSD (Supervised) that primarily relies on eye tracking software to monitor driver attentiveness. We also increased the robustness of our next - gen FSD (Supervised) model with substantially more parameters. Looking ahead to future autonomous driving and robotaxi service, we continued progress on software and hardware development. Optimus is performing its first task handling batteries in one of our facilities. The south extension of Gigafactory Texas is nearing completion and will house our largest cluster of H100s yet. Vehicle and Other Software We continue to release software optimizations that enable an increasingly better experience for customers. The Spring Release included an immersive full -screen vehicle controls view when parked, large playback controls and quick access to Recents, Favorites and Up Next in media player, and an expandable Autopilot visualization, with a smaller map in the top right for trip guidance. Audible is now available as a native app, and Spotify queues can be synced across vehicles and devices and playback speed can be adjusted. Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing In Q2, we produced over 50% more 4680 cells than in Q1 and continued to see cost improvements. In July, we entered validation of vehicle testing for our first prototype Cybertruck produced with in- house dry cathode 4680 cells – a major cost reduction milestone once ramped. Cost reduction across our product lineup remains a top priority.8 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 FSD V12 Miles FSD Miles 0 15,000 30,000 45,000 60,000 75,000 90,000 Existing Capacity Future Planned Capacity (1)Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous. O T H E R H I G H L I G H T S Energy Storage deployments (GWh) Non-Automotive gross profit ($M) Our non-automotive business is becoming an increasingly profitable part of Tesla. As energy storage products continue to ramp and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth of our non- automotive business over time. Energy Generation and Storage Both Megapack and Powerwall achieved record deployment in Q2, resulting in 9.4 GWh of total storage deployments. Overall, the Energy business achieved record revenues and gross profit in Q2. The Lathrop Megafactory continues to ramp successfully, achieving a production record in Q2, and the Shanghai Megafactory remains on track for start of production in Q1 2025. While we expect production to continue to grow sequentially, deployments will continue to fluctuate. Deployment timing depends on many factors, including project milestones and logistics timing as we deliver product globally from a single factory. Powerwall 3 rollout continued successfully, and is now available in Canada, the U.K. and Germany, in addition to the U.S. Services and Other Sequential profit growth for the Services and Other business was driven mostly by service center margin improvement and higher gross profit generation from collision repair. We continue to expand our Supercharging network – and expect to deploy more capacity this year than the rest of the industry combined in North America – with a focus on capital efficiency, congestion and improved coverage. In an effort to increase EV penetration, we remain committed to opening the network to non -Tesla EVs, and plan to onboard more OEMs in North America by the end of the year. Over time, network utilization should continue to increase, driving revenue growth and profit generation. 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -1,000 -800 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 O U T L O O K Volume Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and we believe the next one will be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next generation vehicle and other products. In 2024, the growth rates of energy storage deplo yments and revenue in our Energy Generation and Storage business should outpace the Automotive business. Cash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long -term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hard ware- related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet -based profits. Product Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produ ced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line -up. This approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This should help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production before investing in new manufacturing lines. Our purpose-built Robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy. 10 P H O T O S & C H A R T S E L E C T R I C V E H I C L E A D O P T I O N R A T E - R E T

call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on July 23, 2024 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter. CERTAIN TERMS When used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume includes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. "Adjusted EBITDA" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. "Free cash flow" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION Consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability, investment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 26, 2024. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 28
