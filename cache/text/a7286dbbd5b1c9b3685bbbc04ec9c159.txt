Not just a superfast chip – accelerated computing is a full-stack combination of: • Chip(s) with specialized processors • Algorithms in acceleration libraries • Domain experts to refactor applications To speed-up compute-intensive parts of an application A full-stack approach: silicon, systems, software For example: • If 90% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 9X • If 99% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 50X • If 80% of the runtime can be accelerated by 500X, or even 1000X, the application is sped up 5X Amdahl’s law: The overall system speed-up (S) gained by optimizing a single part of a system by a factor (s) is limited by the proportion of execution time of that part (p).

An enterprise customer starts with an NVIDIA or 3rd party pre-trained AI model, available in NVIDIA AI Foundations. This model making service includes frameworks such as NVIDIA NeMo for custom LLMs and NVIDIA Picasso for custom generative AI for visual design. With help from NVIDIA experts, the enterprise customer fine-tunes the model on their proprietary enterprise data and adds guardrails, using tools available in NVIDIA AI Foundations. The fine-tuning and optimization is done on NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a cloud service that allows enterprises immediate access to NVIDIA AI infrastructure and software, hosted at partner cloud providers. The enterprise customer ends up with a fully-trained and optimized AI model, fine-tuned on their proprietary enterprise data, that can be deployed anywhere — in the cloud or on-prem. The NVIDIA AI Foundry model generates revenue based on per-node, per-month consumption of NVIDIA DGX Cloud. For building enterprise AI applications NVIDIA AI Foundations NeMo | Picasso Pre-trained LLMs NVIDIA DGX Cloud NVIDIA AI foundry AI Factories — A New Class of Data Centers “AI factories” are a new class of data centers specially built for processing, refining and transforming vast amounts of data into valuable AI models and tokens. Unlike traditional data centers built for IT workloads, AI factories are built to deliver automated, professional skills. AI factories are not multi-workload or multi-tenant. They run one workload – an AI model – and have just one customer or owner — analogous to a traditional factory. AI factories can be built on-prem, in the cloud, or in the data centers of SaaS and AI platform vendors. We believe that in the future, every important company will run its own AI factories in order to securely process its valuable proprietary data and turn it into monetizable tokens, encapsulating its knowledge, intelligence, and creativity. In addition to the up-front revenue opportunity from data center systems, NVIDIA can generate recurring revenue from AI factories for their use of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the operating system for enterprise AI. For running enterprise AI applications DATA TOKENS Enterprise SaaS & AI Platforms Enterprise On-PremCloud AI Factory NVIDIA AI Enterprise NVIDIA AI Enterprise The operating system for enterprise AI NVIDIA AI Enterprise is software for deploying and running AI with enterprise-grade security, API stability, manageability and support.
