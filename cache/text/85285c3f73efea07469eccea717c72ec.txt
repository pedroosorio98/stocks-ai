(NYSE: JP M) today reported first-quarter 2009 net income of $2.1 billion, comp ared with net income of $2.4 b illion in the first quarter of 2008. Earnings per share were $0.40, compared with $0.67 in the first quarter of 2008. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “The firm earned more than $2 billion this quarter, despite extremely high credit costs of $10 billion (including $4 billion added to reserves), largely in Card Services and Retail Financial Services. Importantly, we generated record firmwide revenue; record revenue and net income in the Investment Bank; and benefited from underlying growth in Retail Banki ng, including increased deposits and checking accounts, higher J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release mortgage refinancing volumes and excellent progress on the Washington Mutual integration. We also continued to see solid volumes and ear nings across Commercial Banking, Treasury & Securities Services and Asset Management.” As of March 31, 2009, the firm reported a Tier 1 Capital rati o of 11.3%, or 9.2% excluding Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) capital from the government. Tangible common equity compared to risk-weighted assets was 7.2%, the allowance for credit losses was $28 billion and the firmwide loan loss coverage ratio stood at 4.53%. Dimon commen ted: “We remain focused on capital and balance sheet strength. These levels of capital and reserves, combined with our significant pre-provision earnings power, enable us to withstand an even worse economic scenario than we face today.” Dimon further remarked: “We are maintaining our efforts to help the economy recover. We continue to lend and have extended approximate ly $150 billion in new credit to consumer and corporate customers during the first quarter. We made additional progress on our foreclosure prevention program, opening the remaining 22 of our 24 new Chase Ho meownership Centers during the quarter, and continued working towa rds our goal of preventing 650,000 foreclosures by the end of next year to help keep people in their homes. Throughout this crisis, we have remained committed to doing our part to help bring stabilit y to the communities in which we operate and to the financial system overall.” Looking ahead to the rest of 2009, Dimon conclude d: “It is reasonable to expect additional increases to credit reserves if the economic environment worsens. Yet, we are confident that even a highly adverse economic scenario would not compromise our overall strength and stability – or our ability to enhance our franchises. We remain well-positioned to be nefit when the economy recovers and remain committed to serving our clie nts, investing in our franchise and building a stronger company for the future.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $389 million, co mpared with a net loss of $856 million in the prior year. Compared with the prior qua rter, the current quarter net loss of $389 million improved by $27 million, reflecting wider loan spreads and higher mortgage production revenue predominantly offset by a decline in MSR risk management results, an increase in the provision for credit losses and higher servicing expense. Net revenue was $4.5 billion, nearly double the $2.3 bil lion recorded in the pr ior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transactio n, higher mortgage fees and related income, and wider loan spreads. The increase in mortgage fees and related income was driven by higher net mortgage servicing revenue and higher mortga ge production revenue.

Discussion of Results: Net loss was $547 million, a decline of $1.2 billion fr om the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue. End-of-period managed loans were $176.1 billion, an increase of $25.2 bil lion, or 17%, from the prior year and a decrease of $14.2 billion, or 7%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans were $183.4 billion, an increase of $29.8 billion, or 19%, from the prior year and a decrease of $3.9 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter. The incr ease from the prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans was predominantly due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, while the decrease fr om the prior quarter reflected s easonally lower charge volume.

Net interest income was $4.5 billion, up by $1.3 billion, or 41%, from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads and higher average managed loan balances. These benefits were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-o ffs and a decreased level of f ees. Noninterest revenue was $647 million, a decrease of $72 million, or 10%, from th e prior year; the decline was driven by lower securitization income, offset by the impact of the Washington Mutual tr ansaction and higher merchant servicing revenue related to the disso lution of the Chase Paymentech Solutions joint venture. 6 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release The managed provision for credit losses was $4 .7 billion, an increase of $3.0 billion, or 179%, from the prior year.

Private Wealth Management revenue declined 11% to $312 million, due to the effect of lower markets. Retail revenue declined by 46% to $253 million, due to the effect of lower markets and net equity out flows. Bear Stearns Brokerage contributed $95 million to revenue. Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $105 billion, or 7%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down by $72 billion, or 6%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to the effect of lower market s and outflows from non-liq uidity products, offset largely by liquidity product inflow s across all segments and the a ddition of Bear Stearns assets under management. Custody, brokerage, administra tion and deposit balances were $349 billion, down $33 billion, due to the effect of lower mark ets on brokerage and custody balances, offset by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage. The provision for credit losses was $33 million, an increase of $17 million from the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $25 million, or 2%, from the prior year, due to lower performance-based compensation and lower h eadcount-related expense, offset by the effect of the Bear Stearns merger and higher FDIC insurance premiums. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Pretax margin1 was 22%, down from 30%.  Assets under management of $1.1 trilli on include growth of $154 billion, or 33%, in liquidity products.  Assets under management net inflows were $15 billion for th e quarter and $119 billion for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2009.  Assets under management ranked in th e top two quartiles for investment performance were 66% over five years, 62% over three years and 54% over one year.  Customer assets in 4 and 5 Star–rated funds were 42%.  Average loans were $34.6 billion, down by $2.0 billion, or 6%.  Average deposits were $81.7 billion, up by $13.6 billion, or 20%. 10 J.P.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP ba sis was $25,025 million, $17,226 million, and $16,890 million for the first quarter of 2009, fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2008, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $232 milli on, or 10%, from the prior year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit lo sses and higher noninterest expense, predominantly offset by higher net revenue. 11 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release Managed net revenue was $26.9 billion, an increase of $9.0 billion, or 50%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $11.5 bill ion, up by $3.0 billion, or 35%. The increase was driven by significantly higher trading revenue and positive MSR risk management results; these were offset partially by the absence of proceeds from the sale of Visa shares in its initial public offering in the first quarter of 2008. Net interest income was $15.5 billion, up by $6.1 billion, or 65%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, highe r investment- and trading-related net interest income, wider loan spreads, and higher liability balances. The managed provision for credit losses was $1 0.1 billion, up by $5.0 billion, or 97%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provisi on for credit losses was $8.5 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, as well as increases in the allowance for credit losses primarily related to credit card loans and home lending. Consumer- managed net charge-offs were $5.7 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in th e prior year, resulting in managed net char ge-off rates of 4.90% 2 and 2.68%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, compared with $747 m illion in the prior year, and resulted from an increase in the allowance for credit losses reflec ting a weakening credit environment. Wholesale net charge-offs were $191 million, compared with ne t charge-offs of $92 million in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.32% and 0.18%, respectively. The firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $14.7 billion at March 31, 2009, up from the prior-year level of $5.1 billion. Noninterest expense was $13.4 billion, up by $4.4 billion, or 50%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher performance-based compensation expense in the Investment Bank, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction and higher FDIC insurance premiums. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Tier 1 Capital ratio was 11.3% at March 31, 2009 (estimated), 10.9% at December 31, 2008, and 8.3% at March 31, 2008.  Headcount was 219,569 at March 31, 2009, which includes 38,211 from the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations. The remaining 181,358, which includes headcount from th e Bear Stearns merger, reflects a decrease of 808 from March 31, 2008. 12 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, wh ich is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments. First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for cr edit losses, net charge-offs a nd loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations ar e funded and decisions are made about al locating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on th e balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both th e credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Ac cordingly, revenue from tax-exempt s ecurities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basi s comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financ ial Supplement (first quarter 2009) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. b. Tangible Common Equity ("TCE") represents common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less identifiable intangible assets (oth er than MSRs) and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities. TCE is, in management's view, a meaningful measure of capital quality. c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. 13 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release JPMorgan Chase & Co.
