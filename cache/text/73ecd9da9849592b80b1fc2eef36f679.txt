Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $24.1 billion, $22.8 billion, and $23.2 billion for the first quarter of 2015, fourth quarter of 2014, and first quarter of 2014, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.9 billion, up $645 million, or 12%, from the prior year predominantly driven by higher revenue. Net revenue was $24.8 billion, up $967 million compared with the prior year, predominantly driven by strong performance in the Corporate & Investment Bank, both in Markets and Investment Banking. In addition, there was an increase in fee revenue in Asset Management and Mortgage Banking, partially offset by lower gains in Private Equity. Net interest income was $11.0 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year. Noninterest expense was $14.9 billion, up $247 million compared with the prior year, driven by higher Firmwide legal expense. On an adjusted expense1 basis, expense was $14.2 billion down $402 million compared with the prior year, driven by business simplification in the Corporate & Investment Bank and lower noninterest expense in Consumer & Community Banking. The current quarter also benefited from $177 million in tax adjustments, compared to a tax charge of approximately $90 million in the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $959 million, $109 million higher than the prior year, despite $217 million of lower net charge- offs, reflecting lower reserve releases of $93 million versus $419 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was $10.7 billion, an increase of $170 million compared with the prior year, driven by higher noninterest revenue across businesses, up $302 million. Net interest income was $7.0 billion, down $132 million, driven by spread compression, largely offset by higher deposit balances in Consumer & Business Banking and higher credit card loans. Noninterest expense was $6.2 billion, a decrease of $247 million from the prior year, driven by lower Mortgage Banking and Consumer & Business Banking expense. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 The provision for credit losses was $930 million, approximately $100 million higher than the prior year, despite lower net charge- offs, reflecting lower reserve releases. Consumer & Business Banking net income was $828 million, an increase of $77 million compared with the prior year, driven by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, reflecting lower net interest income, down $117 million, due to deposit spread compression; this was offset by higher noninterest revenue, up $77 million, driven by higher investment revenue and debit card revenue. Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $107 million from the prior year, primarily driven by branch efficiencies. Mortgage Banking net income was $326 million, an increase of $194 million from the prior year. Net revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of $151 million compared with the prior year, driven by lower MSR risk management losses, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. MSR risk management was a loss of $68 million, compared with a loss of $400 million in the prior year, which included a negative $460 million fair value adjustment primarily related to higher capital allocated to the business. Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $184 million from the prior year, reflecting lower compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was $4 million, slightly higher than the prior year, despite lower net charge-offs of $104 million, offset by a reduction in the non credit-impaired allowance for loan losses of $100 million as home prices and delinquency trends continued to improve. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto14 net income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $33 million compared with the prior year. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, driven by higher noninterest revenue on higher Auto lease income and net interchange income, largely offset by higher amortization of new account originations. Net interest income was $3.3 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.0 billion, up $44 million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher Auto lease depreciation. The provision for credit losses was $866 million, an increase of $103 million from the prior year despite lower net charge-offs, reflecting lower reserve releases.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a) In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b) Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period- end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c) Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures, and exclude Firmwide legal expense. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. d) Estimated as of 1Q15. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 146–153 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. e) The CIB provides the change in Total Markets and Fixed Income Markets revenue excluding the revenue related to business simplification, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the underlying performance of the business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 2. Represents the estimated impact of Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In capital rules to which the Firm will be subject commencing January 1, 2019. 3. Last twelve months (“LTM”). 4. Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are calculated for the first quarter of 2015 versus the prior-year first quarter. 5. Excludes Commercial Card. 6. CB’s Commercial and Industrial ("C&I") grouping is internally defined to include certain client segments (Middle Market, which includes Nonprofit Clients and Corporate Client Banking) and does not align with regulatory definitions. 7. CB's Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") grouping is internally defined to include certain client segments (Real Estate Banking, Commercial Term Lending and Community Development Banking) and does not align with regulatory definitions. 8. Assumes a tax rate of 38% for items that are tax deductible. 9. Represents the estimated liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR") based on the Firm's current understanding of the U.S. LCR rules which became effective January 1, 2015. 10. High quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) is the estimated amount of assets that qualify for inclusion in the U.S. LCR, which became effective January 1, 2015. 11. Core loans include loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. 12. Net of employee issuance. 13. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents credit provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. 14. Chase Commerce Solutions, formerly known as Merchant Services, includes Chase Paymentech, ChaseNet and Chase Offers businesses. 15. Effective with the first quarter of 2015, the Firm began including the results of Private Equity in the Other Corporate line within the Corporate segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. The Corporate segment’s balance sheets and results of operations were not impacted by this reporting change. 16. Effective January 1, 2015, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance for investments in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. The guidance was required to be applied retrospectively and accordingly, certain prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.
