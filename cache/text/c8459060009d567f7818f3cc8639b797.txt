Both re ports are available on the Firm’s website and are discussed at greater length in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial results: “For the third consecutive year, the Firm reported both record net income and a return on tangible common equity 1 of 15%. The Firm’s results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses fo r the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong l ending and deposit growth. We also maintained our leadership positions and continued to gain market s hare in key areas of our franchise. As we highlight upfront in this release, there were several signifi cant items that affected our results this quarter, but they largely offset each other.” Dimon added: “We continued to see favorable credit conditions across our wholesale loan portfolios and strong credit performance in our credit card portfo lio, where charge-off rates remain at historic lows . The real estate portfolios, while at elevated levels of losses, continued to show improvement as the housi ng market and economy continued to recover. As a resul t, we reduced the related allowance for credit loss es by $700 million in the fourth quarter and we are li kely to continue to see reductions in the allowance as the environment improves.” Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: “We st rengthened our fortress balance sheet, ending the fourth quarter with a strong Basel I Tier 1 common ratio 1 of 11.0%, up from 10.4% in the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio 1 was approximately 8.7% 3 at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 8.4% in the third quarter.” Dimon added: “During the course of 2012, JPMorgan C hase was able to make more of an impact on our communities than ever before. The Firm provided cre dit 1 and raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for our clients during the year. This included $20 billion for small businesses, up 18%. We also originated mo re than 920,000 mortgages; provided credit cards to ab out 6.7 million people; and raised capital and provided credit 1 of approximately $85 billion for nearly 1,500 not- for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and uni versities. As part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, whi ch JPMorgan Chase helped launch, since the beginning o f 2011, the Firm has hired nearly 5,000 U.S. veterans and members of the National Guard and Rese rve; and, through our nonprofit partners, we have provided 386 mortgage-free homes for deserving veterans and their families.” “We are committed to doing our part to speed the re covery of the housing market. This includes working with struggling homeowners to modify their loans, o r pursue other options to allow them to prevent foreclosure. Through these efforts, since 2009, we have offered more than 1.4 million mortgage modifications and completed 610,000 for both loans we own and those we service for others. With respect to Chase-owned mortgages, through modificat ions and short-sales, we have effectively forgiven more than $10 billion of principal and reduced borr owers’ interest payments by approximately $2 billio n. Our efforts are not only helping people, they are a lso helping set the stage for a recovery in America ’s housing market, which will ultimately reward our customers, shareholders and communities alike.” Dimon concluded: “We are particularly proud that, t hrough the turbulence of recent years, we never stopped serving clients and investing in the future of our franchise − opening new offices and branches, adding bankers in key markets, innovating and gaini ng market share. The capital strength and earnings power of the Firm is as strong as it has ever been, and our 260,000 employees are doing more than ever to serve our customers and clients, and support our communities around the world. Challenges still exi st, but as we look forward to 2013, we remain optimistic.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is prese nted on a managed basis.

See notes on page 14 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23,653 million, $25,146 million, and $21,471 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, third quarter of 2012, and fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.7 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 53 %, from the prior year. The increase in earnings wa s driven by higher net revenue and lower provision fo r credit losses, partially offset by higher noninte rest expense. Net revenue was $24.4 billion, up $2.2 billion, or 10%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.1 billion, up $3.2 billion, or 32%, from the prior year, due to higher mortgage fees a nd related income, higher investment banking fees and higher principal transactions revenue. The current- quarter revenue includes a $567 million loss from D VA on certain structured and derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm’s credit spreads. Net interest income was $11.3 billion, dow n $989 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as wel l as runoff of higher-yielding loans, faster mortgage-ba cked securities repayments and limited reinvestment opportunities, partially offset by lower deposit costs. The provision for credit losses was $656 million, d own $1.5 billion, or 70%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, down $745 million from the prior year. Th e decrease in the consumer provision reflected a $700 million reduction of the allowance for loan losses related to the mortgage portfolio due to improved d elinquency trends and lower estimated losses, primarily in the home equity portfolio. Consumer ne t charge-offs were $1.8 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the prior year, resulting in net ch arge-off rates 1 of 1.99% and 2.74%, respectively. The decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $430 m illion, primarily driven by recoveries and a reduct ion in the allowance for credit losses, both related to certain restructured nonperforming loans, compared with an expense of $353 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $158 million, compared with net charge-offs of $346 million in the prior y ear, resulting in a net recovery rate of 0.21% and a net charge-off rate of 0.52%, respectively. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 2.43%, compared with 3.35% in the prior year.

Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Basel I Tier 1 common ratio 1 was 11.0% at December 31, 2012, compared with 10.4% at September 30, 2012, and 10.1% at December 31, 2011.  Headcount was 258,965, a decrease of 1,192, compared with the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a re ported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which i s a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definiti on of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results an d includes certain reclassifications to present tot al net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, rev enue from tax- exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a ba sis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP f inancial measure allows management to assess the co mparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt so urces. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reporte d by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-o f-period loans excludes the following: loans accoun ted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses re lated to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowan ce for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion a t December 31, 2012, September 30, 2012, and Decemb er 31, 2011. In Corporate & Investment Bank, the ratio for the allo wance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is cal culated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB’s allowance coverage. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represents common st ockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equit y less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible as sets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of TCE. In management’s view, thes e measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and inv estors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity and i n facilitating comparisons with peers. d. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common ca pital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, an d trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 c ommon capital, a non- GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulato rs, investors and analysts to assess and compare th e quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm use s Tier 1 common capital along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of the Basel Cap ital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III.” I n June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published final rules on Basel 2.5 that went into effect on January 1, 2 013 and result in additional capital requirements for trading positio ns and securitizations. Also, in June 2012, the U.S . federal banking agencies published for comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the “NPR”) for implementing Basel III, in the United States. The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ra tio under Basel III is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesse s as currently conducted based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking age ncies, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Fi rm may make in the future to its businesses as a re sult of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm’s estima tes of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolv e over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of furthe r rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a k ey measure to assess the Firm’s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in o rder to enable management, investors and analysts t o compare the Firm’s capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. e. In Consumer & Community Banking, supplemental infor mation is provided for Card Services to provide mor e meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delin quency rates presented include loans held-for-sale. f. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, the following m etrics are provided excluding the impact of debit v aluation adjustments (“DVA”): net revenue, net income, compe nsation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management, investors and analysts to assess the un derlying performance of the business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benef its (excluding performance-based incentives), and o ther noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Asset Management pretax margin represents income be fore income tax expense divided by total net revenu e, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of preta x performance derived by measuring earnings after a ll costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the perform ance of AM against the performance of their respective peers. c. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Com mercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general pu rpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the third quarter of 2012. d. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commit ments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses refle cts loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking; Card, Merchant Services & Auto; a nd Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provide d to nonprofit and government entities, including states , municipalities, hospitals and universities, repre sents that provided by the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking. e. Mortgage Banking credit costs are included in the f unctional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense for Mortgage Production. JPMorgan Chase & Co.
