GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.27, down 72% from a year ago and up 4% from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.58, down 50% from a year ago and up 14% from the previous quarter. &ldquo;We are quickly adapting to the macro environment, correcting inventory levels and paving the way for new products,&rdquo; said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. &ldquo;The ramp of our new platforms ― Ada Lovelace RTX graphics, Hopper AI computing, BlueField and Quantum networking, Orin for autonomous vehicles and robotics, and Omniverse ― is off to a great start and forms the foundation of our next phase of growth. &ldquo;NVIDIA&rsquo;s pioneering work in accelerated computing is more vital than ever. Limited by physics, general purpose computing has slowed to a crawl, just as AI demands more computing. Accelerated computing lets companies achieve orders-of-magnitude increases in productivity while saving money and the environment,&rdquo; he said. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, NVIDIA returned to shareholders $3.75 billion in share repurchases and cash dividends, bringing the return in the first three quarters to $9.29 billion. As of October 30, 2022, the company had $8.28 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization through December 2023. NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share on December 22, 2022, to all shareholders of record on December 1, 2022.

CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA&rsquo;s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com/ . Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2023 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA&rsquo;s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com . The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA&rsquo;s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA&rsquo;s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA&rsquo;s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, contributions, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, restructuring costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where applicable and domestication tax benefit. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user&rsquo;s overall understanding of the company&rsquo;s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company&rsquo;s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company&rsquo;s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company&rsquo;s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. &nbsp;
