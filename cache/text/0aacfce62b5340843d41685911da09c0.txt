1 Exhibit 1.01 MICROSOFT CORPORATION CONFLICT MINERALS REPORT FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1 TO DECEMBER 31, 2018 I. INTRODUCTION This Conflict Minerals Report (“CMR”) for MICROSOFT CORPORATION (“Microsoft”) is filed as an exhibit to Microsoft’s Form SD pursuant to Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Rule”) for the 2018 reporting year. The report covers all Microsoft majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are subject to the Rule . The Rule imposes certain due diligence and reporting obligations on US Securities and Exchange Commission (“ SEC”) registrants whose manufactured products (including products contracted to be made for each registrant) contain “conflict minerals” necessary to the functionality or production of those products. The Rule defines “conflict minerals” to include cassiterite, columbite -tantalite, gold, wolframite and their derivatives limited to tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (collectively referred to as “3TGs”). Microsoft develops, licenses, and supports a wide range of software products, services and hardware devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives. Microsoft is committed to the responsible sourcing of raw materials globally in support of human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental protection, and business ethics. Our commitment and strategy are outlined in Microsoft ’s Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials (“RSRM”) policy. Under our policy, Microsoft takes a holistic approach to the responsible sourcing of raw materials while working toward the use of c onflict-free minerals in our devices. We strive to avoid harming communities through an inadvertent de facto embargo of minerals from Conflict Affected and High Risk Areas (“CAHRAs"), including th e Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”) or DRC-adjoining countries. The Rule defines the DRC and any of its adjoining countries as a “Covered Country.” The number of Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (“RMAP”)1 conformant smelters or refiners (“SORs”) in our supply chain remained consistent at 252. Since our last CMR filing, we have taken the following actions to improve our raw material due diligence: • Leveraged the results from the full integration of the RSR M program into our S ocial and Environmental Accountability (“SEA”) audit process to drive improvements in our supply chain for raw material sourcing; • Visited a tin smelter in China to understand the Responsible Minerals Initiative (“RMI”) smelter preaudit and to help us have a clearer picture of upstream and downstream suppliers; • Strengthened external p artnerships to increase on -the-ground risk mitigation and enhance Microsoft’s due diligence capabilities; and 1 Please note: this CMR contains references and hyper -text links to non -Microsoft, external websites. These links are provided for informational purposes only. Their inclusion in this CMR does not establish Microsoft’s endorsement of or assumption of liability for content posted on these external websites. 2 • Strengthened internal partnerships to identify raw material risk at an early product development stage. Microsoft devices contain one or more 3TGs and are within the Rule’s scope. Devices manufactured during the 2018 reporting year included: • Surface line of computers and other intelligent devices; • Xbox gaming/entertainment consoles and accessories; • HoloLens, a self-contained holographic computer; and • Personal computing accessories (mice, headsets, and keyboards). On the basis of our “Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry” (“RCOI”) (see Section II), we determined that 3TGs contained in our devices may have originated in a Covered Country. Therefore, we are submitting this CMR, which describes the conflict minerals due diligence we performed during the 2018 reporting year, as an exhibit to our Form S D. We have published the CMR externally on our responsible sourcing website. The manufacture of our devices during any specified time period may include raw materials sourced before, as well as during, that time period. Some 3TGs used during the 2018 reporting year may have been smelted and refined prior to the Rule’s initial reporting period . While such 3TGs are excluded from the Rule’s scope, our RCOI and supply chain due diligence conducted for the 2018 reporting year may have included such minerals. II. REASONABLE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN INQUIRY Our RCOI corresponds to the first and second steps of the five -step OECD Due Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict -Affected and High -Risk Areas (“OECD Guidance”). The OECD Guidance provides a detailed due diligence framework to support responsible global supply chain management of minerals and is currently the only internationally recognized framework for raw material due diligence. The OECD Guidance (including its Supplements) applies to each of the 3TGs and to Microsoft as a “downstream company.” Microsoft does not source directly from 3TG raw material providers. We source products from suppliers, which source materials, components, and products from their sub-tier suppliers. Our supply chain is extensive and complex with many layers of suppliers positioned between ourselves and 3TG raw materials providers and processors (also known as "SORs"). We refer collectively in this CMR to directly contracted strategic suppliers as “in-scope suppliers.” Due to our extended supply chain, we leverage our in-scope suppliers to provide information on the sources and chains of custody of 3TGs necessary to the manufacture of our devices. We provide more detail on our supply chain due diligence process in Section III. The graphic below demonstrates Microsoft’s span of influence with its suppliers. 3 A. Establish Strong Company Management Systems 1. Company Policies The Microsoft Global Human Rights Statement and Supplier Code of Conduct define our expectations concerning ethical business, employment, environmental, and worker safety practices . Microsoft’s RSRM policy describes our commitment and strategy to responsibly source raw materials used in our devices. Microsoft is committed to indirectly source raw materials in support of human rights, labor, health and safety, environment, and ethics. This pledge extends to the harvesting, extraction, and transportation of raw materials globally and to all substances used in our devices unbounded by specific materials or locations. Our policy supports implementation of programs that are region - specific and work toward the use of conflict-free minerals in our devices. We require our suppliers to conform to these policies and to include them in their contracts with their sub-tier suppliers. Our supplier specifications and internal procedures establish supplier requirements for the responsible sourcing of raw materials, including 3TGs. We audit our suppliers to ensure these requirements are met. 2. Internal Management Team A cross-functional team supports Microsoft’s responsible sourcing and 3TG compliance activities. A General Manager of the Devices Group sponsors the team. The team consists of representatives from Strategic Sourcing; Responsible Sourcing/Social and Environmental Accountability ; Manufacturing; Accounting/Finance; Internal Audit ; Experiences and Devices Group ; Corporate, External and Legal Affairs; Business and Corporate Responsibility; Information Services; and Product Environmental Compliance. This team meets quarterly to assess the program’s progress, identify steps necessary to meet our compliance obligations, and identify areas for continuous improvement. The team also trains other internal stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities for implementing and supporting Microsoft’s responsible sourcing program. Team members are responsible for developing, reviewing, filing, and publishing the CMR. 4 3. System of Supply Chain Controls and Transparency Our suppliers provide us information concerning the source and chain of custody of raw materials from Conflict-Affected and High -Risk Areas (“CAHRAs”) , including 3TGs, contained in the products and components they supply to us. Many of our in-scope suppliers are also subject to the Rule. These suppliers rely on information provided by their suppliers to meet their compliance obligations. Our contracts require all Microsoft in -scope suppliers to identify every substance contained in the materials, components, and products supplied to us , including 3TGs , by weight . Our in-scope suppliers are responsible for communicating our sourcing requirements and specifications to their sub-tier suppliers, including our raw material due diligence requirements. In addition, we require all in -scope suppliers to submit a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (“CMRT”) annually and provide updated data upon request or when sourcing pra ctices change. These CMRTs are evaluated for completeness, data integrity, due diligence thoroughness, and sourcing risk. Potential risks may include a failure to fully complete the CMRT, data inconsistencies, and possible sourcing from a CAHRA. Microsoft investigates each identified issue and engages with suppliers to address all concerns regarding conformance to Microsoft policies, procedures, and specifications. In cases where the supplier is identified as sourcing from a CAHRA, suppliers are required t o submit a CMRT more frequently and further assess and mitigate risk with their sub-tier suppliers. If we find that a supplier has introduced unmitigated risk to the Microsoft supply chain, such as using an upstream SOR that does not conform to Microsoft’s RSRM policy or specifications, Microsoft requires corrective action to address the non-conformance. The response time for corrective action is calibrated to the severity of the identified risk. Risks are mitigated by supplier engagement, corrective actions, training, and/or additional audits. These controls and related documentation are detailed in H02050 - Microsoft Supplier Social and Environmental Accountability Manual and Microsoft internal operating procedures. Microsoft works with impacted suppliers to find sources for RMAP conformant minerals. If a supplier does not commit to a RMAP conformant source within a reasonable time period, Microsoft places the supplier on restricted status and no new Microsoft business is awarded until the non-conformance is resolved. Microsoft may also terminate its business relationship with the supplier. Microsoft is a long-standing member of the Responsible Business Alliance. In 2008, the RBA initiated the Conflict Free Smelter Program, which evolved to become the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) in 2018. The RMAP is one of the most utilized and respected resources for addressing supply chain responsible sourcing issues. The RMAP uses independent third -party audits to assess and monitor whether SORs process 3TGs from sources that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in a Covered Country . Microsoft also financially supports the Industrial Technology Research Institute’s Tin Supply Chain Initiative (“iTSCi”), which has established a system of traceability and due diligence in Covered Countries. 5 We partner closely with Pact, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (“IRMA”), and Alliance for Responsible Mining (“ARM”). These organizations address human rights concerns in mining and leverage data and technology to bring about even greater change. Empowered by digital technology, Microsoft and our partners are working to drive transformations in the mining sector by addressing issues of increased scope and complexity. We believe this integrated approach improves conditions for the people working in raw material supply chains. Our primary relationships are further described below: • Pact: Since 2014, we have supported a Pact project in the DRC to reduce child labor in mining. The results in Pact’s Watoto Inje Ya Mungoti (Children Out of Mining) project verify the effectiveness of Pact’s approach, data , and experience. The Children Out of Mining report states: “This project “reached 4,100 beneficiaries, of whom 1,881 were children. Bans on child labor were enforced at 23 mine sites in the target area by the end of the project. Reduction in child labor between 77 percent and 97 percent over the course of the proj ect to date.” Yves Bawa, Pact country director for DRC, Rwanda, and Burundi notes that, “Microsoft was one of our first partners on this important issue. Its seed funding helped us achieve groundbreaking progress in the first two years of work.” We announced a new, expanded commitment in 2017 to continue this work as it is evident that this proven strategy can improve the livelihood of impoverished workers who labor in artisanal cobalt mines. • Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance ("IRMA") : IRMA established a multi-stakeholder and independently verifiable responsible mining assurance system that improves social and environmental performance through the development of global mining standards for large- scale mines. Our partnership i nvolves more than just participation – we are bringing technology to help scope, scale , and implement effective programs. Microsoft donated a technology platform to IRMA that will allow the organization to better implement these assurance standards. By pairing the technolo gy platform with Power BI, a cloud-based business analytics service, stakeholders will be able to track mining performance against the assurance standards. This real-time information, presented in an easy-to-see and easy-to-use interface, will help mining companies and Non-Governmental Organizations ( “NGOs”) overcome the inherent difficulties of scope and complexity of responsible mining programs to create new insights and inspire additional progress. With learnings from this engagement, we hope to enable additional NGO partners to expand their work to create sustainable mining communities. • Alliance for Responsible Mining ("ARM") : ARM sets standards for responsible artisanal and small-scale mining and supports and creates opportunities for gold miners, providing them with incentives to become responsible economic, technological , and environmental enterprises. Seed funding from Microsoft helped ARM secure further resources to develop a Market Entry Standard for Artisanal a nd Small-scale Gold Miners. Microsoft continues to support an ASM gold mining project in Peru which has attracted additional donors, furthering ARM’s efforts to develop certified gold mining sites throughout the region. 6 4. Supplier Engagement Given the complexities of the global mineral supply chain, we work closely with our suppliers around the world to ensure they share and duplicate our commitment with their upstream suppliers . RMAP’s “Reasonable Practices to Identify Sources of Conflict Minerals: Practical Guidance for Downstream Companies ” states, “all of the [OEC D Guidance’s] red flag triggers are contained in the upstream portion of the supply chain (e.g., SORs and mine of origin) .” Because these conflict mineral supply chain “triggers” are directed to upstream companies, rather than downstream manufacturers such as Microsoft, we mitigate raw material sourcing risks by working with our in - scope suppliers to identify raw material SORs and encoura ge those facilities to become RMAP conformant or use an alternate facility that is RMAP conformant. We also participate in industry- wide initiatives that assess SOR conformance with the OECD Guidance as recommended by RMAP guidance. We drive responsible sourcing through our extended supply chain by surveying our in-scope suppliers’ sourcing of raw materials in their upstream supply chains. We also use tools that include supplier and smelter capability building and support broader industry efforts to promote responsible mining and sourcing. Finally, we conduct audits of our contracted suppliers to verify conformance to Microsoft requirements. More information is set forth below. • Supplier Requirements: We require our in -scope suppliers to meet our material disclosure requirements and related responsible sourcing policies through contractual provisions and product sp ecifications. W e communicate, monitor, and track supplier adher ence to these requirements, ensuring conformance through the Microsoft Audit Management System (“AMS”). These policies and procedures are outlined in Section III, and the public can access them on Microsoft’s Responsible Sourcing Website . We also train our directly contracted suppliers to meet our requirements through classes, educational forums , and direct communications. • Capability Building and Partnerships: We work closely with our supply chain partners to build their raw material suppliers’ capabilities for achieving our responsible sourcing goals. With the empowerment of digital technology, Microsoft and our partners can drive transformations in the mining sector by addressing issues of increased scope and complexity. We invest in industry programs, such as the RMAP, to increase suppliers’ abilities and provide platforms to them for sharing best practices. • Supplier Audits: Microsoft conducts audits of its directly contracted suppliers to assess their conformance to Microsoft requirements. All new contracted in-scope suppliers undergo an Initial Capability Assessment (“ICA”) to verify conformance. Existing contracted in-scope suppliers also undergo a Sustaining Maintenance Audit ( “SMA”) on an annual, biannual , or triannual basis depending on their risk level. Suppliers must establish and maintain a corporate policy and eff ective procedures for the responsible sourcing of raw materials. Microsoft selects and retains only those business partners committed to meeting these requirements. A failure by a supplier or sub -tier supplier to conform to these requirements may constitute a breach of the supplier’s contractual agreement with Microsoft , resulting in possible business termination. 7 5. Grievance Mechanism Microsoft’s Global Human Rights Statement expresses our commitment to provide an anonymous grievance reporting mechanism for our employees and other stakeholders who may be impacted by our operations. Microsoft’s Business Conduct Hotline allows employees and others to anonymously ask compliance questions or report concerns regarding Microsoft’s business operations, including our responsible sourcing of raw materials policy or those of our suppliers. We investigate and, where appropriate, take remedial action to address reported concerns. We also participate in industry efforts to develop grievance mechanisms to address responsible sourcing of raw materials related issues. B. Identify and Assess Risk in the Supply Chain We took the following steps to identify and assess supplier conflict mineral sourcing risk during the 2018 reporting year2: • Following the Rule and SEC guidance, we generated a list of potential in-scope suppliers. • We surveyed all potential in-scope suppliers to determine the status of any 3TGs contained in devices manufactured during the 2018 reporting year by utilizing the RMAP-standard CMRT and the services of a third -party solution provider. The survey followed OECD Guidance as tailored for Microsoft’s role as a downstream company. Our survey included questions regarding the supplier’s raw material due diligence policies and procedures, its practices for engaging with its upstream suppli ers, the SORs from which its 3TGs were sourced, and the origins of 3TGs contained in the supplier’s products. • We reviewed all s upplier CMRT submissions to validate their completion and to identify contradictions or inconsistencies. We worked with our third-party solution provider to obtain updated responses from suppliers when necessary. • We identified 174 active in-scope suppliers for the 2018 reporting year. Of these suppliers, we received survey responses from 171 of those suppliers - a 98 percent response rate. 2 Microsoft completed its supplier conflict mineral sourcing data analysis for the 2018 reporting year on April 12 , 2019. 8 Figure 1. Response Rate for Active In-scope Suppliers (2013-2018 Reporting Years) III. DUE DILIGENCE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE On the basis of our RCOI, we determined that 3TGs contained in our devices may have originated in one or more Covered Country. Accordingly, we designed and performed due diligence on the source and chain-of-custody of those 3TGs. A. Due Diligence Design Our 3TG s due diligence process conformed to the third and fourth steps of the five -step OECD Guidance. The first and second steps of the five-step OECD Guidance were addressed in Section II. B. Due Diligence Performed 1. Design and Implement a Strategy to Respond to Risks Microsoft required its suppliers to minimize the possible sourcing of 3TGs from CAHRAs through contract requirements incorporating Microsoft’s supplier specifications. 71% 82% 97% 99% 98% 98% 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Response Rate for Surveyed Active In-scope Suppliers 9 a. Microsoft Supplier Specifications - H00594, H00642 and H02050 Microsoft required identification of all materials , including 3TG s, used in packaging and hardware products and parts on a component -by-component level using its supplier specification H00594, Restricted Substances for Hardware Products. H02050, Microsoft’s Supplier Social and Environmental Accountability Manual, required all in-scope suppliers to: • Post a responsible sourcing policy, conforming to the OECD Guidance, on their website; • Exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of high risk raw materials, including 3TGs, contained in materials, components, or products supplied to Microsoft; • Identify, by name, each SOR that has processed or otherwise handled 3TGs contained in those materials, components, or products; • Encourage those SORs to participate in RMAP or an equivalent third-party responsible mineral audit scheme; • Confirm that 3TGs in their supply chain are sourced from available SORs that are conformant with the RMAP or an equivalent independent private sector audit firm; and • Notify Microsoft immediately if minerals used in the supplied materials, components, or products may contain 3TGs sourced from a CAHRA. H02050 required all in-scope suppliers to impose these same requirements on their sub-tier suppliers and to assist sub -tier suppliers with appropriate training and suppo rt. To facilitate this process , Microsoft required suppliers to utilize the CMRT provided by the RMAP and available at www.conflictfreesourcing.org. b. Responsible Sourcing Program Manual Processes to Implement OECD Guidance Microsoft used the OECD Guidance to review supplier CMRT data and identify potential red flags for the sourcing of raw materials . The red flags, which require d additional supplier due diligence , included the following: • The minerals originated from or were transported via a CAHRA; • The minerals were claimed to have originated from a country that has limited known reserves for the mineral in question; • The minerals were claimed to have originated from a country in which minerals from a CAHRA are known to transit; 10 • The company’s supplier s or oth er known upstream companies ha d shareholder or other interests in companies that supply minerals or operate in one of the red flag locations of mineral origin and transit; and • The company’s suppliers or other known upstream companies were known to have sourced minerals from a red flag location of mineral origin and transit in the last 12 months. Microsoft’s program includes an escalation process that requires an in -scope supplier to find an alternative to a non-RMAP conformant source of 3TGs for use in materials, components, or products supplied to Microsoft or risk termination as a Microsoft supplier. To date, we have not encountered an RSRM issue with a supplier warranting contract termination. Microsoft’s Supplier Social and Environmental Accountability Program Manual requires self - assessment, monitoring, and internal reporting of the RSRM program’s progress and conformance. We utilize supplier survey updates, supplier communications, supplier social and environmental accountability audits, and new supplier briefings to prevent the introduction of new raw material sourcing risks to our supply chain . We leverage Microsoft’s SEA Committee meetings with senior management to report findings and receive program guidance. c. Industry and Partner Engagement Microsoft participated in or has been a member of several industry-wide responsible mining and smelting initiatives: RMAP, ITRI’s iTSCi pro gram, PPA, IRMA, Pact, and ARM. We also conducted smelter outreach on behalf of the RMAP Smelter Engagement Team to further the RMAP program. 2. Carried Out Independent Third-Party Audit of Supply Chain Due Diligence As contemplated by the OECD Guidance, our due diligence program leverage d independent SOR audits. The audits conformed to the RMAP and other similar programs. Microsoft obtained SOR data from the RMAP Conformant Smelter List using Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry Data for member MSFT. The list identifies SOR s that have undergone assessment through the RMAP or industry equivalent program s, such as Responsible Jewelry Council (“RJC”) or London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”). We used the list to support certain statements contained in this CMR. Microsoft also participated in RMAPs Smelter Engagement Team during the 2018 reporting year. 3. Reported on Supply Chain Due Diligence We have filed our CMR with the SEC and concurrently posted it on our website. These disclosures meet the fifth step of the OECD Guidance. The results of our program are presented in Microsoft’s Devices Group’s FY18 Sustainability Report . The Corporate Social Responsibility website provides additional information about Microsoft’s Responsible Sourcing of Raw Materials Program. 11 IV. SOR INFORMATION A. 3TG Processing Facilities Our supplier survey data revealed 311 potential 3TG SORs, which processed 3TGs, in the Microsoft supply chain. We validated the data by removing duplicate SORs, reconciling multiple SOR names for a single entity, and eliminating otherwise invalid SOR names. We then verified if the alleged SORs were active and participants in the RMAP audit program. We determined that 299 SORs met this criteria. The Figures below provide a visual depiction of the 299 SORs identified in Microsoft’s supply chain by RMAP audit status. Figure 2 categorizes the SORs by RMAP audit status and reporting year. Figure 2 indicates that, for the 2018 Reporting Year, the number of conformant SORs remained stable at 252. Figure 3 categorizes the SORs by 3TG mineral and audit status. Figure 2.

The RMAP classifies audit status in the following manner: • Conformant: SOR has been audited and found to conform with the relevant audit protocols, including RMAP, LBMA, or RJC; • Outreach Required: SOR is not yet active and outreach is needed by RMAP member companies to encourage SOR participation in RMAP; • Active: SOR has been engaged but is not yet conformant; • In Communication: SOR is not yet active but is in communication with RMAP and/or member company; • Communication Suspended – Not Interested : SOR has strongly communicated a lack of interest in participation; • Non-Conformant: SOR was audited but found not to conform to the relevant RMAP protocol • RMI Due Diligence Vetting Restriction - Not Applicable: SOR cannot be audited as per RMI’s due diligence vetting process; • Due Diligence Vetting Process : SOR does not meet RMI’s requirements for participation according to the due diligence vetting process • RMI Due Diligence Review – Unable to Proceed : SOR has not met the threshold for Due Diligence Vetting Process after a period of 6 months. Status may change if additional information is submitted • Communication Suspended – Temporarily Ceased Operations : SOR has temporarily ceased operations Table 1: RMAP Audit Status of Identified SORs in Microsoft Supply Chain Number of SORs RMAP Audit Status 252 Conformant (Indicates RMAP, LBMA and/or RJC conformant) 26 Outreach Required 6 Active 3 In Communication 5 Communication Suspended - Not Interested 5 Non-Conformant 0 RMI Due Diligence Vetting Restriction - Not Applicable 1 Due Diligence Vetting Process 1 RMI Due Diligence Review – Unable to Proceed 0 Communication Suspended - Temporarily Ceased Operations 14 Figures 4-7 show the geographic distribution of the 299 SORs identified in the Microsoft supply chain by 3TG mineral for the 2018 reporting year.

Figure 8: Country-of-Origin Information for SORs Identified in Microsoft’s Supply Chain For the identified conflict-free SORs for which minerals sourcing information is available from RMAP3: • 38 smelters, or 13 percent of total smelters, processed recycled or scrap material; and • 22 SORs, or 7 percent of total smelters sourced from Covered Countries and were RMAP compliant. C. 3TG Mines or Locations of Origin Microsoft obtained Reasonable Country of Origin data through our membership in the RMAP using the Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry Data for member MSFT. We used this data to determine the 3TG country of origin of SORs identified in Microsoft’s supply chain. Microsoft supports the continued refinement and expansion of the list of participating SORs in the RMAP audit program through our membership. 3 All numbers include both direct and indirect sourcing. 18 We contact all non -conformant SORs identified in our supply chain each reporting year and encourage SORs to participate in the RMAP. We also require suppliers reporting non-conformant SORs to contact these SORs and request the SORs to join the CFSP. We actively support outreach events to increase RMAP SOR coverage. We funded a third party to help educate SORs and prepare them for the audit process. We also offered to visit SORs to facilitate their participation in the RMAP. V. IMPROVEMENTS The results of Microsoft’s key 2018 reporting year efforts are detailed below: • The number of RMAP-conformant SORs identified in Microsoft’s supply chain remained consistent at 252; • Renewed and extended its engagement with external responsible sourcing organizations, such as Pact, IRMA, and ARM. These organizations are committed to advancing responsible sourcing on a global basis by developing mining standards and addressing issues such as child labor in the mining industry . We partner closely with the m and leverage data and technology to bring about even greater change. With the further empowerment that digital technology can provide toward overcoming increased scope and complexity, Microsoft and our partners can drive positive transformations in the mining sector. We believe this integrated approach is the most effective way to improve conditions for the people working in raw material supply chains and the environment; • Continued to i ncrease Microsoft’s level of engagement with suppliers and internal stakeholders by holding supplier forums, webinars, and in-person trainings, and by providing technical resources; • Leveraged the integrated RSRM program in our SEA audit process to drive improvements in the supply chain; • Ensured commitment to transparency by maintaining Microsoft’s publicly available excerpt of Microsoft’s Supplier Social and Environmental Accountability Program Manual, which includes Responsible Sourcing of Raw Material Requirements; and • Strengthened internal partnerships to identify raw material risk at an early product development stage. VI. FUTURE ACTIONS Microsoft is committed to the responsible sourcing of raw materials used in our hardware products in support of human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental protection, and business. We will continue to advance implementation of our RSRM policy in our supply chain to promote supply chain identification and risk assessment, standardized requirements and verification, capability building, transparency, and strategic partnerships. 19 We will continue to encourage SORs to participate in the RMAP and expand our knowledge about 3TGs in our supply chain . Our ability to identify, assess, and mitigate risk s associated with our raw materials sourcing will improve with ongoing due diligence efforts – with both our direct and sub- tier partners. Consistent with our commitments, we intend to take the following steps to improve our responsible sourcing of raw materials due diligence efforts: • Enhance our use of digital technology to improve supply chain information and risk mitigation; • Increase use of external data sources to proactively identify raw material risk in CAHRAs; • Continue our active participation in the RMAP Smelter Engagement Team to bring non - conformant SORs into the RMAP; and • Further our engagement with organizations like IRMA, ARM, and Pact to establish global responsible sourcing standards and support programs in the mineral supply chain. Microsoft’s efforts to address human rights and advance economic opportunities in Africa do not end with our responsible sourcing programs. In 2013, Microsoft launched its 4Afrika Initiative. We started investing in start-ups, partners, small-to-medium enterprises, governments and youth on the African continent. Our focus has been on delivering affordable access to the internet, developing skilled workforces and investing in local technology solutions. Africa has the potential to lead the technology revolution – and so we’re empowering those with the right ideas to drive economic development, inclusive growth and digital transformation. At Microsoft, we’re very fortunate to have played a part in realising this potential, building strong partnerships to accelerate digital transformation and create sustained societal impact.
