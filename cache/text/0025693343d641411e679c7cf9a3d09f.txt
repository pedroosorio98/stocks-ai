Discussion of Results: Net income was $6.8 billion, an increase of 22%. Net revenue was $23.5 billion, down 6%, driven by lower CIB Markets revenue including business simplification and lower Mortgage Banking revenue. Net interest income was $11.2 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year, as lower investment securities balances and lower trading net interest income were predominantly offset by loan growth. Net interest income was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher loan yields and balances. Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down 3%, driven by lower CIB expense related to compensation and business simplification, partially offset by higher legal expense. The provision for credit losses was $682 million, down 10%, due to lower net charge-offs, largely offset by lower reserve releases. In the current quarter, consumer reserve releases of $591 million13, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, were largely offset by an increase in reserves across the wholesale businesses of $310 million driven by select downgrades, including Oil & Gas. The current quarter reflected tax benefits of $2.2 billion due to the resolution of tax audits and the release of deferred taxes.

Net revenue was $10.9 billion, a decrease of 4%. Net interest income was $7.2 billion, flat compared to the prior year, reflecting spread compression offset by higher deposit and loan balances and a reduction in the reserve for uncollectible interest and fees. Noninterest revenue was $3.7 billion, down 12%, driven by lower Mortgage Banking revenue. Noninterest expense was $6.2 billion, a decrease of 1%, driven by lower Mortgage Banking expense. The provision for credit losses was $389 million, a decrease of 57%, driven by a larger reduction in the allowance for loan losses JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 3 and lower net charge-offs. Consumer & Business Banking net income was $954 million, an increase of 3%. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2%. Net interest income was $2.6 billion, down 7%, due to spread compression, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $2.0 billion, up 5%, driven by higher deposit-related fees, higher debit card revenue and higher investment revenue. Noninterest expense was $3.0 billion, a decrease of 3%, driven by branch efficiencies. Mortgage Banking net income was $602 million, an increase of 29%. Net revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 23%, driven by lower net servicing revenue and the absence of a non-recurring gain reported in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 13%, reflecting continuing mortgage efficiencies. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $534 million, compared with a benefit of $19 million in the prior year, driven by a larger reduction in the allowance for loan losses reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. The current quarter provision reflected an allowance reduction of $575 million, of which $375 million was related to the purchased credit-impaired portfolio and $200 million was related to the non credit-impaired portfolio. Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto14 net income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 6%. Net revenue was $4.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Net interest income was $3.4 billion, an increase of 4%, driven by a reduction in the reserve for uncollectible interest and fees, and higher loan balances. Noninterest revenue was $1.3 billion, down 4%, driven by the impact of changes to co-brand partnerships and higher amortization of new account origination costs, predominantly offset by higher auto lease and card sales volumes. Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, up 8%, driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing expense. The provision for credit losses was $873 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting a smaller reduction in the allowance for loan losses largely offset by lower net charge-offs.

Net revenue was $8.2 billion, a decrease of 10%. Banking revenue15 was $2.8 billion, up 2%. Investment Banking revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5%, on higher debt underwriting fees and higher advisory fees, largely offset by lower equity underwriting fees compared to a strong quarter in the prior year, especially in EMEA. The business continued to rank #1 in Global Investment Banking fees in third-quarter 2015. Treasury Services revenue16 was $899 million, down 4%, reflecting lower net interest income. Markets & Investor Services revenue15 was $5.4 billion, down 16%. Excluding the revenue decline related to business simplification, total Markets revenue would have been down 6%1, and Fixed Income Markets revenue would have been down 11%1. Fixed Income Markets revenue reflected lower revenue in Commodities and continued weakness in Credit, partially offset by strength in Currencies & Emerging Markets; and also reflected higher interest costs on higher long-term debt. Equity Markets revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9%, with strong performance across derivatives and cash driven by higher client volumes. Noninterest expense was $6.1 billion, up 2%, as higher legal expense was offset by lower compensation expense and the benefit from business simplification. 4 The provision for credit losses was $232 million, up $299 million from the prior year, reflecting higher reserves driven by Oil & Gas.

News Release 6 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a) The Firm presents pretax income, net income (assumes a tax rate of 38% for items that are tax deductible) and earnings per share excluding certain notable items. These measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Firm's reported results. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an additional presentation of the Firm's performance. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported results to these non-GAAP financial measures: Reconciliation of reported to adjusted results Three months ended September 30, 2015 Pretax income Net income EPS(in millions, except per share) Reported results $ 6,730 $ 6,804 $ 1.68 Adjustments: Firmwide legal expense 1,347 973 0.26 Firmwide tax benefits — (2,164) (0.57) Consumer credit reserve releases (591) (366) (0.10) Wholesale credit reserve builds 310 192 0.05 Total adjustments 1,066 (1,365) (0.36) Adjusted results $ 7,796 $ 5,439 $ 1.32 b) In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results, including the overhead ratio, and the results of the lines of business, on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. c) Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm's TCE at period- end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. d) Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures, and exclude Firmwide legal expense ($1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2015). Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of this item on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. e) Estimated as of 3Q15. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, the CET1 ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For further discussion of these measures, see Regulatory capital on pages 146–153 of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and pages 67-71 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. f) The CIB provides the change in Total Markets and Fixed Income Markets revenue excluding the revenue related to business simplification, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the underlying performance of the business.
