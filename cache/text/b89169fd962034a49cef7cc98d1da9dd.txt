A quarter of a century in the making, NVIDIA accelerated computing is broadly recognized as the way to advance computing as Moore’s law ends and AI lifts off. NVIDIA’s platform is installed in several hundred million computers, is available in every cloud and from every server maker, powers over 76% of the TOP500 supercomputers, and has over 5 million developers. Headquarters: Santa Clara, CA Headcount: ~29,600 NVIDIA’s Accelerated Computing Platform Full-stack innovation across silicon, systems and software With nearly three decades of singular focus, NVIDIA is expert at accelerating software and scaling compute by a Million-X, going well beyond Moore’s law Accelerated computing requires full-stack innovation—optimizing across every layer of computing—from silicon and systems to software and algorithms, demanding deep understanding of the problem domain Our full-stack platforms—NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse—accelerate AI and industrial digitalization workloads We accelerate workloads at data center scale, across thousands of compute nodes, treating the network and storage as part of the computing fabric Our platform extends from the cloud and enterprise data centers to supercomputing centers, edge computing and PCs Magnum IO DOCA Base Command Forge APPLICATION FRAMEWORKS HARDWARE ACCELERATION LIBRARIES PLATFORM NVIDIA OMNIVERSENVIDIA AI SYSTEM SOFTWARE DGX HGX EGX OVX MLNXRTX AGX SOC SWITCH NIC DPU CPU GPU CUDA-X CUDA RTX What Is Accelerated Computing? Not just a superfast chip—accelerated computing is a full-stack combination of: • Chip(s) with specialized processors • Algorithms in acceleration libraries • Domain experts to refactor applications To speed-up compute-intensive parts of an application A full-stack approach: silicon, systems, software For example: • If 90% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 9X • If 99% of the runtime can be accelerated by 100X, the application is sped up 50X • If 80% of the runtime can be accelerated by 500X, or even 1000X, the application is sped up 5X Amdahl’s law: The overall system speed-up (S) gained by optimizing a single part of a system by a factor (s) is limited by the proportion of execution time of that part (p). 𝑆 = 1 1 − 𝑝 + 𝑝 𝑠 Why Accelerated Computing? Accelerated computing is needed to tackle the most impactful opportunities of our time—like AI, climate simulation, drug discovery, ray tracing, and robotics NVIDIA is uniquely dedicated to accelerated computing —working top-to-bottom, refactoring applications and creating new algorithms, and bottom-to-top—inventing new specialized processors, like RT Core and Tensor Core Advancing computing in the post-Moore’s Law era 102 103 104 105 106 107 109 108 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 GPU-Computing perf 2X per year 1000X In 10 years Single-threaded CPU perf 1.5X perf per year 1.1X per year Trillions of Operations per Second (TOPS) “It’s the end of Moore’s Law as we know it.” —John Hennessy Oct 23, 2018 “Moore’s Law is dead.” —Jensen Huang, GTC 2013 2016 2017 2020 2022 2024 TFLOPS Pascal 19 TFLOPS FP16 Volta 130 TFLOPS FP16 Ampere 620 TFLOPS BF16/FP16 Blackwell 20,000 TFLOPS FP4 Hopper 4,000 TFLOPS FP8 1000x AI Compute in 8 Years A new computing era has begun Accelerated computing enabled the rise of AI, which is driving a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing, and enabling new, never-before-possible applications The trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition to accelerated computing to achieve better performance, energy-efficiency and cost by an order of magnitude Hyperscale cloud service providers and consumer internet companies have been the early adopters of AI and accelerated computing, with broader enterprise adoption now under way AI and accelerated computing will also make possible the next big waves—autonomous machines and industrial digitalization Waves of Adoption of Accelerated Computing A generational computing platform shift Cloud Service Providers & Consumer Internet Enterprise Autonomous Vehicles & Robotics Industrial Digitalization NVIDIA Accelerated Computing for Every Wave NVIDIA HGX is an AI supercomputing platform purpose-built for AI.

An enterprise customer starts with an NVIDIA or 3rd party pre-trained AI model, available in NVIDIA AI Foundations. This model making service includes frameworks such as NVIDIA NeMo for custom LLMs and NVIDIA Picasso for custom generative AI for visual design. With help from NVIDIA experts, the enterprise customer fine-tunes the model on their proprietary enterprise data and adds guardrails, using tools available in NVIDIA AI Foundations. The fine-tuning and optimization is done on NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a cloud service that allows enterprises immediate access to NVIDIA AI infrastructure and software, hosted at partner cloud providers. The enterprise customer ends up with a fully-trained and optimized AI model, fine-tuned on their proprietary enterprise data, that can be deployed anywhere—in the cloud or on-prem. The NVIDIA AI Foundry model generates revenue based on per-node, per-month consumption of NVIDIA DGX Cloud. For building enterprise AI applications NVIDIA AI Foundations NeMo | Picasso Pre-trained LLMs NVIDIA DGX Cloud NVIDIA AI Foundry AI Factories—A New Class of Data Centers ‘AI factories’ are next-generation data centers that host advanced, full-stack accelerated computing platforms for the most computationally intensive tasks, where data comes in and intelligence comes out. These new data centers will act as trusted engines of generative AI. Every important company will run its own AI factories to securely process its valuable proprietary data and turn it into monetizable tokens, encapsulating its knowledge, intelligence, and creativity. Nations are using AI factories as sovereign national resources— processing private datasets of companies, startups, universities and governments safely on shore to produce valuable insights. In addition to the up-front revenue opportunity from data center systems, NVIDIA can generate recurring revenue from AI factories with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the operating system for enterprise AI.
