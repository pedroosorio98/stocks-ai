In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement 2. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, without the volatility arising from CIB Markets. In addition, management also assesses CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management believes that disclosure of these measures provides investors and analysts with other measures by which to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For the full year 2019, NII ex. CIB Markets is calculated by excluding CIB Markets NII of $3.1B from managed NII of $57.8B, and NIR ex. CIB Markets is calculated by excluding CIB Markets NIR of $17.8B from managed NIR of $60.7B. For the full year 2019, managed NII and NIR include $531mm and $2.5B of fully taxable-equivalent adjustments, respectively. For all other periods presented, refer to the reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding CIB Markets on page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement 3. Net income, earnings per share and return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) excluding the Firmwide net credit reserve release are non-GAAP financial measures. The net credit reserve release represents the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. Excluding the net credit reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2021 resulted in a decrease of $1.4B (after tax) to reported net income from $10.4B to $9.0B; a decrease of $0.47 per share to reported EPS from $3.33 to $2.86; and a decrease of 2% to ROTCE from 19% to 17%. Excluding the net credit reserve release resulted in a decrease of 5% to full year 2021 ROTCE from 23% to 18% and an increase of 5% to full year 2020 ROTCE from 14% to 19%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results 4. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $88.07, $86.36 and $81.75 at December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 5. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense of $137mm, $76mm and $276mm for the three months ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively; and $426mm, $1.1B and $239mm for the full year 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 6. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio 19 Additional notes 1. Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020 and expired on December 31, 2021. For the periods ended December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $2.9B, $3.3B and $5.7B, respectively. The cumulative impact of $2.9B not recognized in CET1 capital at December 31, 2021 will be phased in at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021 for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 52-53 and Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable securities, includes the Firm’s average eligible HQLA, other end-of-period HQLA-eligible securities which are included as part of the excess liquidity at the Bank that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR under the LCR rule, and other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2021 and on pages 102-108 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information 3. In the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm's effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis.

All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Primary share class means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class 9. Barlow Research Associates, Primary Bank Market Share Database as of 3Q21.
