Give People a Voice People deserve to be heard and to have a voice&#8212;even when that means defending the right of people we disagree with. Build Connection and Community Our services help people connect, and when they're at their best, they bring people closer together. Serve Everyone We work to make technology accessible to everyone, and our business model is ads so our services can be free. Keep People Safe and Protect Privacy We have a responsibility to promote the best of what people can do together by keeping people safe and preventing harm. Promote Economic Opportunity Our tools help level the playing field so businesses grow, create jobs and strengthen the economy. OUR VALUES Our six values are the signposts that guide our work, how we spend our time, and how we work together. By working at Meta, we each commit to bring these values to our work, each and every day. Move Fast Move Fast helps us to build and learn faster than anyone else. This means acting with urgency and not waiting until next week to do something we could do today. We continuously work to speed up our highest priority initiatives by methodically removing barriers that get in the way. It's about moving fast in one direction together as a company and as individuals. Focus on Long-Term Impact Focus on Long-Term Impact emphasizes long-term thinking that encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins. We should take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results won't be seen for years.

VOTING MATTERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The following table provides summary information about the proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. See the pages of this proxy statement listed below for more information. Proposal Board Voting Recommendation Rationale Management Proposals: 1. The election of fifteen directors (page 27) FOR each nominee &#8226; Slate of highly qualified director nominees with broad and diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets aligned to Meta's unique business. 2. The ratification of the appointment of Ernst&#160;&amp; Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&#160;31, 2025 (page 40) FOR &#8226; The audit &amp; risk oversight committee has selected Ernst &amp; Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm. &#8226; Ernst &amp; Young LLP is an independent accounting firm with the breadth of expertise and knowledge necessary to effectively audit Meta&#8217;s financial statements. 3. The approval of our 2025 Equity Incentive Plan (page 41) FOR &#8226; Our broad-based use of equity has been a key facet of our people practices and enables our employees to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. &#8226; We believe the 2025 Equity Incentive Plan is a key element of the board and management team&#8217;s strategy to align our employees&#8217; interests with those of shareholders and motivate employees to help drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 4. Advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers (page 45) FOR &#8226; Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee and board of directors believe that these policies and practices are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our goals. 5. Advisory vote on the frequency with which we will conduct a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers (page 45) THREE YEARS &#8226; A substantial portion of executive compensation is in the form of long-term equity awards with performance periods of greater than three years. Triennial votes will allow our shareholders to evaluate the effectiveness of such long-term compensation strategies and related business outcomes of our company for the corresponding period, while avoiding over-emphasis on short-term variations in compensation and business results. &#8226; We believe a triennial vote complements our goal of creating a compensation program that enhances long-term shareholder value. 2025 Proxy Statement | 9 Table of Contents Proposal Board Voting Recommendation Rationale Shareholder Proposals: 6. A shareholder proposal regarding dual class capital structure (page 73) AGAINST &#8226; Our board of directors evaluates Meta's capital structure on a regular basis and continues to believe that our current capital structure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. &#8226; Our current capital structure allows our board of directors and management team to focus on the long term. &#8226; Our board of directors provides robust independent oversight and ensures that the interests of our shareholders are considered. &#8226; The requested change to our capital structure is unnecessary and is not in the best interest of Meta and its shareholders at this time. 7. A shareholder proposal regarding disclosure of voting results based on class of shares (page 75) AGAINST &#8226; Our existing disclosures around our capital structure and security ownership already provide transparency to the general public and our shareholders. &#8226; Our board of directors remains committed to effective oversight and consideration of shareholder interests, regardless of which class of common stock our shareholders own. &#8226; The requested disclosure is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. 8. A shareholder proposal regarding report on hate targeting marginalized communities (page 77) AGAINST &#8226; Our Community Standards prohibit hateful conduct targeting protected characteristics on our platform. &#8226; We have content enforcement systems in place to respond to content that violates our Community Standards. &#8226; Our board of directors provides oversight of our approach to content governance. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. 9. A shareholder proposal regarding report on child safety impacts and actual harm reduction to children (page 78) AGAINST &#8226; We are committed to fostering a safe, positive experience online for young people. &#8226; We have made significant changes and investments to help protect young people on our platforms. &#8226; We collaborate with global experts and industry partners to build a broader child protection ecosystem. &#8226; We have robust public disclosure detailing our ongoing child safety efforts, including quantitative metrics on how we took action to enhance child safety. &#8226; The board of directors, primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee, provides oversight over this issue. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders in light of our existing practices, and disclosures regarding child safety. 10 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal Board Voting Recommendation Rationale 10. A shareholder proposal regarding report on risks of deepfakes in online child exploitation (page 82) AGAINST &#8226; Meta&#8217;s Community Standards clearly prohibit content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children, including deepfakes. &#8226; Meta has invested in enhanced child safety tools and works closely with internal and external stakeholders to fight child sexual exploitation and improve policies and enforcement around online safety issues. &#8226; In April 2024, we signed on to principles set by Thorn and All Tech is Human, along with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI and others, to address issues around AI-generated CSAM and child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). &#8226; We report on actions we take against child sexual exploitation, abuse, and nudity in our Transparency Center. &#8226; The board of directors provides oversight over our efforts in this area primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to shareholders in light of our existing practices, and disclosures regarding child safety. 11. A shareholder proposal regarding report on AI data usage oversight (page 85) AGAINST &#8226; Protecting people&#8217;s privacy is core to how we build technology, including AI. &#8226; We have strong privacy practices that address how we use information for both AI and generative AI models and features. &#8226; We collaborate extensively with internal and external stakeholders on our AI data practices to help address key issues around the use of data in our models. &#8226; The board of directors, primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee, oversees our AI data practices. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. 12. A shareholder proposal regarding GHG emissions reduction actions (page 87) AGAINST &#8226; We have matched our operational electricity consumption with 100% clean and renewable energy since 2020. &#8226; We design and operate some of the most sustainable data centers in the industry, and promote data center sustainability by prioritizing energy efficiency and clean and renewable energy. &#8226; We continue to prioritize matching our electricity use with 100% renewable energy by adding new projects to local grids. &#8226; Our board&#8217;s audit &amp; risk oversight committee receives updates on our environmental and sustainability strategy. &#8226; Given our existing efforts, the board of directors believes that the additional request is unnecessary. 2025 Proxy Statement | 11 Table of Contents Proposal Board Voting Recommendation Rationale 13. A shareholder proposal regarding Bitcoin treasury assessment (page 89) AGAINST &#8226; Meta utilizes a thorough decision-making process that considers many types of investable assets. &#8226; This requested assessment is unnecessary given Meta&#8217;s existing processes to manage its corporate treasury. 14. A shareholder proposal regarding report on data collection and advertising practices (page 91) AGAINST &#8226; We take privacy seriously and have invested over $8 billion since 2019 in a rigorous privacy program that is designed to identify and address privacy risks early and embed privacy into our products from the start. &#8226; Our Privacy Center provides answers to common privacy questions, information about how we use data, and links to tools that allow people who use our technologies and programs to protect their own privacy. &#8226; We provide users with a variety of tools to view, manage, control, and download their personal information. &#8226; We regularly report on our privacy progress. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. 12 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Director Nominees and Executive Officers The following section provides information regarding our director nominees and executive officers as of April&#160;17, 2025.

The relevant experiences, qualifications, attributes, or skills of each nominee that led our board of directors to recommend the above persons as a nominee for director are described in the sections of this proxy statement entitled "Director Nominees and Executive Officers" and "Corporate Governance." The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the election of each of the nominated directors. 2025 Proxy Statement | 27 Table of Contents Corporate Governance BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our board of directors may establish the authorized number of directors from time to time by resolution. The current authorized number of directors is fifteen. Each of our director nominees, if elected, will serve as a director until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. Strong Independent Leadership Ambassador Kimmitt has significant responsibilities as our Lead Independent Director, including working with the Chairman to set agendas for meetings of our board of directors and having authority to call special meetings of our board of directors, and is appointed annually by our independent directors. Independent Nominations Our independent compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has sole authority to recommend nominees to our board of directors and recommend the appointment of candidates to our privacy &amp; product compliance committee. Board Leadership and Independence Highlights Nearly All Directors Are Independent All of our director nominees are independent, with the exception of our CEO. All members of our standing committees are independent. Executive Sessions Independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions, which are led by our Lead Independent Director without management present. Board Refreshment Five new independent directors have joined our board since our last Annual Meeting of Shareholders. BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE We believe that our current board structure is effective in supporting strong board leadership. The board of directors has determined in its judgment that the company benefits from having a combined Chairman and CEO position at this time. Mr. Zuckerberg's unique perspective and experience, as highlighted more fully below, are valuable in setting the overall direction and business and product strategy for the company. As a counter-balance to Mr. Zuckerberg's combined Chairman/CEO role, the board has a strong Lead Independent Director role to further promote effective corporate governance. Our Lead Independent Director is appointed annually by our independent directors, and Ambassador Kimmitt currently serves in this role. Mr. Zuckerberg brings valuable insight to our board of directors due to his perspective and experience as our founder and CEO. As a result of his leadership since our inception, Mr. Zuckerberg has unparalleled knowledge of our business, products, and operations, as well as experience navigating opportunities and challenges particular to our company. As our largest and controlling shareholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is also invested in our long-term success. Ambassador Kimmitt brings extensive governance, legal, and compliance experience, including through service in the public sector and experience navigating complex business opportunities and challenges in the private sector, and plays a significant and meaningful role in leading our board of directors. The Chairman and the Lead Independent Director work together to facilitate effective oversight, governance, and policy- and decision-making by the board of directors. The Chairman and the Lead Independent Director collaborate to set the agenda for meetings of the board of directors, and each has the ability to include items on the agenda independent of the other with advance notice. In addition, either the Chairman or the Lead Independent Director may call special meetings of the board of directors. As Chairman, Mr. Zuckerberg presides over meetings of the board of directors. As our Lead Independent Director, Ambassador Kimmitt provides independent oversight and promotes effective communication between our board of directors and management, including Mr. Zuckerberg. As more fully described in our corporate governance guidelines, our Lead Independent Director role also includes the following authority and responsibilities, among others: &#8226; presiding at all meetings of the board of directors at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors; 28 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents &#8226; calling separate meetings of the independent directors; &#8226; facilitating discussion and open dialogue among the independent directors during meetings of the board of directors, executive sessions, and otherwise; &#8226; serving as principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman; &#8226; providing the Chairman with feedback and counsel concerning his interactions with the board of directors; &#8226; providing leadership to the board of directors if circumstances arise in which the role of the Chairman may be, or may be perceived to be, in conflict; &#8226; taking into account input from other independent directors in coordinating with the Chairman to set the agenda for meetings of the board of directors; and &#8226; leading our board of directors in governance matters in coordination with our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, including the evaluation of the performance of the CEO, the selection of committee chairs and memberships, and our annual board of directors and committee self-evaluations. Our Lead Independent Director also performs such additional duties as the board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate. INDEPENDENT BOARD OVERSIGHT We believe that our current board structure enables independent board oversight. All of the standing committees of our board of directors are comprised of independent directors. The board of directors also establishes ad hoc special committees of independent directors from time to time, as appropriate. We have a Lead Independent Director who has authority that mirrors that of the Chairman, including coordinating and setting board meeting agendas and the ability to call special meetings of the board of directors. Our Lead Independent Director regularly interacts with the independent directors on an individual basis, and also meets with the chief executive officer and shares perspectives from the independent directors. The independent compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviews and approves the compensation of our chief executive officer, including perquisites related to executive security. In addition, the performance of our Chairman and chief executive officer is evaluated by all of the independent directors of the board, and our Lead Independent Director provides our chief executive officer with feedback regarding his performance. BOARD COMMITTEES Our board of directors has established an audit &amp; risk oversight committee, a compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, and a privacy &amp; product compliance committee, each of which has the composition and responsibilities described below. Our board of directors has adopted a written charter for each of these standing committees, which are available at investor.atmeta.com/leadership-and-governance . Our board of directors regularly reviews and reassesses our committee membership and structure, including each committee's charter.

Equity Subcommittee. The charter for our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee allows the committee from time to time to delegate its authority to subcommittees and to our officers as it deems appropriate and to the extent permitted under applicable law, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) rules, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws (except with respect to the recommendation of director nominees and other actions 2025 Proxy Statement | 31 Table of Contents within the sole authority of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee). To ease with the administration of our broad employee equity program, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has delegated the authority to review and approve grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and consultants, other than to our directors and executive officers, to an equity subcommittee. This subcommittee is currently comprised of Ms. Li and Ms. Newstead, and they can act individually or jointly. RSU grants to our directors and executive officers are reviewed and approved by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. BOARD ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT Our board of directors has responsibility for overseeing our risk management and believes that a thorough and strategic approach to risk oversight is critical. The board of directors exercises this oversight responsibility directly and through its committees. The oversight responsibility of the board of directors and its committees is informed by regular reports from our management team, including senior personnel that lead a variety of functions across the business, our internal audit department, and input from external advisors, as appropriate. These reports are designed to provide timely visibility to the board of directors and its committees about the identification and assessment of key risks, our risk mitigation strategies, and ongoing developments. Each committee also provides regular reports to the full board of directors regarding its oversight activities. The following table presents a summary of the allocation of primary responsibility for general risk oversight functions among the board, the board's committees, and management: BOARD OF DIRECTORS &#8226; Strategic and business risk management &#8226; CEO succession planning AUDIT &amp; RISK OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE PRIVACY &amp; PRODUCT COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE COMPENSATION, NOMINATING &amp; GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE &#8226; Financial and enterprise risk &#8226; Legal and regulatory compliance &#8226; Cybersecurity &#8226; Policies and procedures for assessing and managing risk &#8226; Internal audit function &#8226; Privacy and data use, including legal and regulatory compliance &#8226; Compliance with comprehensive privacy program adopted in compliance with FTC consent order &#8226; Steps taken or planned to monitor or mitigate privacy and data use and product compliance risks &#8226; Selection of independent, third-party assessor to review our privacy practices, oversight of the biennial assessments, and regular engagement with the assessor &#8226; Product compliance, including in the areas of content governance and integrity, youth and well-being, and artificial intelligence &#8226; Director elections and corporate governance practices &#8226; Compensation policies and practices, including compensation philosophy, objectives, and design &#8226; Succession planning for our board of directors, including sole responsibility for director nominations and appointments to and removals from the privacy &amp; product compliance committee &#8226; Succession planning for certain key executives other than the CEO SENIOR MANAGEMENT &#8226; The identification and assessment of key risks, risk mitigation strategies, and ongoing developments, and regularly reporting to our board of directors and its committees on the most significant risks and management's plans to address those risks 32 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents BOARD MEETINGS Our board of directors held twelve meetings during 2024. In 2024, no incumbent member of our board of directors attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the board of directors (held during the period for which he or she was a director) and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the board of directors on which such director served (held during the period that such director served). Members of our board of directors are invited and encouraged to attend each annual meeting of shareholders. Eight directors attended our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Each regular meeting of our board of directors includes an executive session of our independent directors, led by our Lead Independent Director, without management present. Additional executive sessions and separate meetings of the independent directors are also held from time to time, as needed. As more fully described below, our Lead Independent Director presides at executive sessions and separate meetings of the independent directors. CONTROLLED COMPANY STATUS Because Mr. Zuckerberg controls a majority of our outstanding voting power, we are a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq. Therefore, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. We have nevertheless opted to have a majority of our board of directors be independent and to have a compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee comprised of independent directors, as more fully described below. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE The rules of Nasdaq generally require that a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors be independent. In addition, the Nasdaq rules generally require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation, and nominating committees be independent. Although we are a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules of Nasdaq and, therefore, are not required to comply with certain rules requiring director independence, we have nevertheless opted, under our corporate governance guidelines, to have a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent. On at least an annual basis, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviews the independence of our non-employee directors and makes recommendations to the full board of directors. Based, in part, on the recommendations of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, our board of directors has determined that none of our current non-employee directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the rules of Nasdaq. Our board of directors has also determined that the directors who comprise our audit &amp; risk oversight committee and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee satisfy the respective independence standards for those committees established by applicable SEC rules and Nasdaq rules. With respect to the independence of Ms. Alford, Mr. Andreessen, Mr. Collison, Mr. Elkann, Mr. Houston, Ms. Travis, Mr. White, and Mr. Xu, our board of directors considered that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PayPal), of which Ms. Alford was Executive Vice President, Global Sales; Coinbase Global, Inc., of which Mr. Andreessen is a member of the board of directors and may be deemed a significant shareholder primarily through Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm affiliated with Mr. Andreessen; Stripe, Inc. (Stripe), of which Mr. Collison is Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors; Stellantis N.V., of which Mr. Elkann is Executive Chair and a member of the board of directors; Dropbox, Inc. (Dropbox), of which Mr. Houston is Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors; The Est&#233;e Lauder Companies Inc., of which Ms. Travis is Executive Vice President &amp; Senior Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer; Ultimate Fighting Championship, of which Mr. White is President and Chief Executive Officer; and DoorDash, Inc., of which Mr. Xu is Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors, purchased and in some cases received credits to purchase advertising from us in the ordinary course of business pursuant to our standard terms and conditions, including through a competitive bid auction. Our board of directors also considered that we made payments to PayPal and Stripe for services relating to payment processing, and Dropbox for services relating to data storage, in the ordinary course of business pursuant to standard terms and conditions. With regard to Ms. Alford, Mr. Andreessen, Mr. Collison, Mr. Elkann, Mr. Houston, Ms. Travis, Mr. White, and Mr. Xu, our board of directors determined that such arrangements, transactions, or relationships do not interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by these directors in carrying out their responsibilities as our directors. In addition, our board of directors considered that Ambassador Kimmitt is senior international counsel at the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (WilmerHale), an international law firm. From time to time and in the ordinary course of its business, WilmerHale provides legal services to Meta, which in 2024 amounted to approximately 3% of WilmerHale's total 2025 Proxy Statement | 33 Table of Contents revenue. Ambassador Kimmitt has not provided any legal services to Meta during his term as a director and only provided de minimis legal services to Meta in the three years prior to his appointment to our board in March 2020. Ambassador Kimmitt is not a partner in the firm and does not receive any compensation from the firm that is generated by or related to our payments to WilmerHale for such services. In addition, WilmerHale has implemented measures to ensure that Ambassador Kimmitt is walled off from any legal representation of Meta undertaken by WilmerHale. Further, our&#160;compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviewed the nature of Meta's engagement of WilmerHale and the services rendered, including the expertise and relevant experience of the firm, and determined that Ambassador Kimmitt's service on our board should not impair our company's ability to engage WilmerHale when our company determines such engagements to be appropriate and in our best interests. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee&#160;is satisfied that WilmerHale, when engaged for legal work, is chosen by our company's legal group on the basis of the directly relevant factors of experience, expertise, and efficiency. Ambassador Kimmitt does not have influence over the selection of our company's legal counsel. After&#160;taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, our board of directors determined that Meta's professional engagement of WilmerHale does not interfere with Ambassador Kimmitt's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as a director. Additionally, our board of directors considered Meta's transactions with Broadcom Inc. (Broadcom), of which Mr. Tan serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors. See the section of this proxy statement entitled "Related Party Transactions" for more information regarding such transactions. After taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, our board of directors determined that Meta's transactions with Broadcom do not interfere with Mr. Tan's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as a director. CLASSIFIED BOARD So long as the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, we will not have a classified board of directors, and all directors will be elected for annual terms. As of the close of business on April&#160;1, 2025, the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represented a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, we will automatically shift to having a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms. At such time, our directors will be assigned by the then-current board of directors to a class. Upon expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors for that class will be elected for three-year terms at the annual meeting of shareholders in the year in which that term expires. As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our shareholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Each director's term will continue until the third annual meeting of shareholders following their election and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. In addition, when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock and we have a classified board, only our board of directors may fill vacancies on our board. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the total number of directors. This shift to a classified board structure, if and when implemented, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management. DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS The policy of our board of directors is to encourage the selection of directors who will contribute to Meta's success and our mission to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating candidates for membership on our board of directors, based on the criteria set forth in our corporate governance guidelines, and has sole authority to recommend nominees to our board of directors. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considers recommendations from other directors, shareholders, management, and others as it deems appropriate and uses the same criteria for evaluating candidates regardless of the source of the recommendation. Our board of directors is responsible for nominating persons for election to our board of directors upon the recommendation of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, and may not nominate any person for election without the prior favorable recommendation of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. 34 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Meta is committed to a policy of inclusiveness and to pursuing diversity in terms of background, skills, experience, and perspective. As such, when evaluating candidates for nomination as new directors, it is the policy of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee to consider candidates with diverse backgrounds in terms of knowledge, experience, skills, and other characteristics, in light of the specific needs of the board of directors at that time.&#160;In addition, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considers director tenure in connection with evaluating current directors for nomination for re-election. With respect to our recent director elections, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee retained a third-party search firm to assist in the process of identifying and evaluating potential director candidates. Additionally, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee solicited input from management, our board of directors, and others. Ms. Powell McCormick and Messrs. Collison, Elkann, Songhurst, and White were identified as potential candidates by members of management or the board of directors. In addition, Messrs. Collison and Songhurst were previously members of the Meta Advisory Group, which is composed of outside advisors that our management team periodically consults with on strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap. Shareholders who would like to recommend director candidates for consideration by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee should send a notice of proposal by writing to our Secretary at the address of our principal executive offices. Shareholders desiring to nominate a director candidate at the annual meeting must comply with other procedures in accordance with our bylaws. We explain the procedures for nominating a director candidate at next year's annual meeting in the section entitled "Questions and Answers About the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting&#8212;How can I make proposals or make a nomination for director for next year's annual meeting?" BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS Our board of directors recognizes the importance of regularly assessing its effectiveness and continuously improving its functioning. Each year the board conducts a robust, formal performance assessment, which is facilitated by an outside third party and includes individual director evaluations, as more fully described below. In addition to the formal process, our Lead Independent Director has regular one-on-one discussions with the other members of the board and actively conveys feedback from the independent directors on an ongoing basis to our Chairman and CEO. Formalized Annual Process for Full Board and Each Committee &#8226; Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, in coordination with our Lead Independent Director, oversees the assessment process. &#8226; Each director receives a written questionnaire covering the topics described below. &#8226; An outside third party conducts individual interviews with each director to discuss their feedback to the written questionnaire. &#8226; An outside third party consolidates feedback from all directors and reports on the results at a meeting of the board of directors. &#8226; Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee and board of directors annually consider whether to make any updates to the assessment process. Wide Range of Topics Covered &#8226; All directors are asked to provide feedback on the performance of the board of directors, each committee, and each director, including performance in board leadership roles. &#8226; All directors are asked to provide feedback on board size and structure, board composition and independence, board meeting agendas, materials, and conduct, risk oversight, interaction with management, and succession planning, among other matters. &#8226; Members of each committee and the Lead Independent Director are asked to provide feedback on the respective committee's composition, charter, and meeting agendas, materials, and conduct, among other matters. Results Drive Enhancements &#8226; We use the results of the annual assessment to make enhancements and continue to improve board effectiveness. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee and our board of directors also periodically review the composition of the board of directors to ensure that it appropriately reflects the knowledge, experience, skills, diversity, and other characteristics required to fulfill its duties. DIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND EDUCATION We provide a number of onboarding sessions for new members of our board of directors to engage with our management team and learn more about our company priorities, strategy, and operations, as well as key opportunities, issues, and risks facing our industry, business, and community. Our management team also regularly engages with our directors throughout the 2025 Proxy Statement | 35 Table of Contents year to provide updates across these areas, including in-depth reviews of relevant issues from subject matter experts.

John Hegeman, an immediate family member of one of our executive officers, is employed by us as our Chief Revenue Officer. In 2024, Mr. Hegeman received total compensation, consisting of base salary, bonus, and other compensation, including the grant date fair value of an RSU award (which award vests over a period of four years), of approximately $23.7 million. Hock E. Tan is the president and chief executive officer of Broadcom Inc. (Broadcom). We are a party to certain arrangements with Broadcom, whereby we directly and indirectly purchase Broadcom's component products. We are also a party to certain other arrangements with Broadcom whereby Broadcom provides us with services such as design, development and engineering and we pay Broadcom directly for these services. In 2024, the total amount paid to Broadcom under these arrangements was approximately $987 million. We charter a private aircraft that is indirectly and wholly owned by Javier Olivan and operated by an independent charter company for business travel by Mr. Olivan. On certain occasions, Mr. Olivan may be accompanied by guests when using such aircraft, and certain of our other personnel may also use such aircraft for business travel. For all such use, we pay an amount commensurate with market rates for comparable travel pursuant to a written policy overseen by our audit &amp; risk oversight committee and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee.

If the related party is, or is associated with, a member of our audit &amp; risk oversight committee, then either such member shall recuse himself or herself from review of the transaction, or the transaction must be reviewed and approved by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. Any request for us to enter into a transaction with a related party must first be presented to our legal department for review. Our legal department then refers any transaction with a related party in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and such party would have a direct or indirect material interest to our audit &amp; risk oversight committee for review, consideration and approval. If advance approval of a transaction between a related party and our company was not feasible or was not obtained, the transaction must be submitted to the legal department for review as soon as reasonably practicable for determination of whether the transaction constituted a related-party transaction. The 38 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents legal department then refers such transaction to the audit &amp; risk oversight committee, at which time the audit &amp; risk oversight committee considers whether to ratify and continue, amend and ratify, or terminate or rescind such related-party transaction. Report of the Audit &amp; Risk Oversight Committee This report of the audit &amp; risk oversight committee is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, in accordance with the SEC's rules, will not be deemed to be part of or incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference, and will not otherwise be deemed "soliciting material" or "filed" under either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The principal purpose of the audit &amp; risk oversight committee is to assist the board of directors in its general oversight of our accounting practices, system of internal controls, audit processes and financial reporting processes. The audit &amp; risk oversight committee is responsible for appointing and retaining our independent auditor and pre-approving the audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor. The audit &amp; risk oversight committee's function is more fully described in its charter. Our management is responsible for preparing our financial statements and ensuring they are complete and accurate and prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our independent auditor, Ernst &amp; Young LLP (EY), is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with GAAP. The independent auditor is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The audit &amp; risk oversight committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 with management and with EY. These audited financial statements are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Annual Report). The audit &amp; risk oversight committee has also discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the SEC. The audit &amp; risk oversight committee also has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding EY's communications with the audit &amp; risk oversight committee concerning independence, and has discussed with EY its independence. Based on the review and discussions described above, the audit &amp; risk oversight committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report for filing with the SEC. THE AUDIT &amp; RISK OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE Tracey T. Travis (Chair) Peggy Alford John Arnold Nancy Killefer Hock E. Tan 2025 Proxy Statement | 39 Table of Contents Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The audit &amp; risk oversight committee of the board of directors has selected Ernst &amp; Young LLP to be our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December&#160;31, 2025, and recommends that the shareholders vote for ratification of such appointment. Ernst &amp; Young LLP has been engaged as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2007. We expect representatives of Ernst &amp; Young LLP to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement at the Annual Meeting if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. AUDIT AND RELATED FEES The following table sets forth the aggregate fees for audit and other services provided by Ernst &amp; Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 2024 2023 Audit fees (1) $ 21,397&#160; $ 20,271&#160; Audit-related fees (2) 7,243&#160; 1,697&#160; Tax fees (3) 7,718&#160; 8,350&#160; All other fees (4) 2&#160; 3&#160; Total fees $ 36,360&#160; $ 30,321&#160; (1) Audit fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for (i) the audit of our annual financial statements and the audit of our internal control over financial reporting included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and a review of financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, (ii) services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those years, and (iii) accounting consultations. (2) Audit-related fees consist of attest services over compliance with the European Union's Digital Services Act, System and Organizational Controls reporting, and other attest services. (3) Tax fees in 2024 include $6.1 million for tax compliance projects and $1.6 million for tax advisory projects. Tax fees in 2023 include $7.5 million for tax compliance projects and $0.8 million for tax advisory projects. (4) All other fees consist of fees for services other than the services reported in audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax fees. The audit &amp; risk oversight committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent accountants. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services. The audit &amp; risk oversight committee generally pre-approves particular services or categories of services on a case-by-case basis. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the audit &amp; risk oversight committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with these pre-approvals, and the fees for the services performed to date. All of the services of Ernst &amp; Young LLP for 2024 and 2023 described above were pre-approved by the audit &amp; risk oversight committee. The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP. 40 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal Three: Approval of the 2025 Equity Incentive Plan Overview of Action Our board of directors is asking our shareholders to approve the Meta Platforms, Inc. 2025 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2025 Plan). The board approved the 2025 Plan on February 13, 2025, subject to approval by our shareholders. If the 2025 Plan is approved by shareholders, the 2025 Plan will be effective as of such date (the Effective Date). The 2025 Plan is intended as the successor to the Meta Platforms, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2012 Plan), which will expire in April 2026 pursuant to its terms. Meta seeks to offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people. Meta employees' total compensation package generally includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity offered in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) at the time of hire and through annual RSU grants. Our broad-based use of equity has been a key facet of our people practices and enables our employees to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. Currently, nearly all full-time employees are awarded Meta equity. We believe the 2025 Plan is a key element of the board and management team&#8217;s strategy to align our employees' interests with those of shareholders and motivate employees to help drive long-term growth and shareholder value. We also believe the 2025 Plan will provide incentives to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the success of the company, and any parents, subsidiaries and affiliates that exist now or in the future, by offering them an opportunity to participate in the company&#8217;s future performance through the grant of awards. If the 2025 Plan is approved by our shareholders, the 2025 Plan will replace the 2012 Plan as of such date, and we will cease granting any new awards under the 2012 Plan. If the 2025 Plan is not approved by our shareholders, the 2012 Plan will remain in effect in its current form, and we will continue to be able to grant equity incentive awards under the 2012 Plan until its expiration. Following the expiration of the 2012 Plan, we will be unable to maintain our current equity grant practices and, therefore, we will be at a significant competitive disadvantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating talented individuals who contribute to our success. Summary of the 2025 Plan The principal terms of the 2025 Plan are summarized below. This summary is not a complete description of the 2025 Plan, and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2025 Plan document. The 2025 Plan is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement. Shares Available for Issuance Subject to adjustment (as described below), the number of common shares that may be subject to awards granted under the 2025 Plan as of the Effective Date will equal (i) any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2012 Plan on the Effective Date, plus (ii) shares that are subject to awards granted under the 2012 Plan that cease to be subject to such award by forfeiture or otherwise after the Effective Date, and plus (iii) shares that are subject to awards under the 2012 Plan that are used or withheld to pay the exercise price of an option or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award. Substitute Awards (as defined below) may be granted under the 2025 Plan and any such grants shall not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the 2025 Plan. To the extent an award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2025 Plan. Shares used or withheld to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the 2025 Plan. The number of shares available for issuance is not reduced with respect to awards granted or shares issued by us in assumption of, or in substitution or exchange for, awards previously granted, or the right or obligation to make future awards, by a company acquired by us or one of our affiliates or with which we or one of our affiliates combines (Substitute Awards). The number of shares available for grant and issuance under the 2025 Plan shall be increased on January 1, of each of the 10 calendar years during the term of the 2025 Plan following the Effective Date, by the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the number of shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on each December 31 immediately prior to the date of increase or (ii) such number of shares determined by the board. 2025 Proxy Statement | 41 Table of Contents The 2025 Plan authorizes the award of RSUs, stock options, restricted stock awards (RSAs), stock bonuses, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and performance shares (each as more fully described below). Any awards in shares or cash that are made outside of the 2025 Plan and permitted by applicable listing requirements are not subject to these limitations. The 2025 Plan also allows us to grant recipients of awards of RSUs or RSAs the right to share-settled dividend equivalents or dividend equivalent units. The maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to incentive stock options is 425,000,000. Administration The 2025 Plan is administered by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee (the Administrator) or by the board of directors acting in place of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. The Administrator has the authority to construe and interpret the 2025 Plan, select participants and grant awards, and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2025 Plan. The Administrator may delegate its authority under the 2025 Plan to a subcommittee consisting of one or more executive officers, subject to applicable law. The Administrator has delegated authority to grant certain awards under the 2025 Plan to the equity subcommittee of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. Eligibility The 2025 Plan provides for the grant of awards to our employees, directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors, provided the consultants, independent contractors, directors, and advisors render services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. As of December 31, 2024, 74,067 employees (including each of our executive officers) and twelve non-employee directors were eligible to participate in the 2025 Plan. The basis for participation in the 2025 Plan is the Administrator's decision, in its sole discretion, that an award to an eligible participant will further the 2025 Plan's purposes of providing incentives to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to our success and the success of our affiliates, by offering them an opportunity to participate in our future performance through the grant of awards. In exercising its discretion, the Administrator will consider the recommendations of management and the purposes of the 2025 Plan. Forms of Awards The following is a description of the types of awards permitted to be issued under the 2025 Plan. Restricted Stock Units . An RSU is an award that covers a number of shares that may be settled upon vesting in cash, by the issuance of the underlying shares, or a combination of both. These awards are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting as a result of termination of employment or failure to achieve certain vesting conditions. Stock Options . The 2025 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options that qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) only to our employees. All awards other than incentive stock options, including awards of non-qualified stock options, may be granted to our employees, directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors, provided the consultants, independent contractors, and advisors render services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted to 10% shareholders must be at least equal to 110% of that value. The maximum term of options granted under the 2025 Plan is ten years or, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to 10% shareholders, five years. Restricted Stock Award . An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares subject to restrictions. The price, if any, of an RSA will be determined by the Administrator. These awards are subject to forfeiture or repurchase prior to vesting as a result of termination of employment or failure to achieve certain vesting conditions. Stock Appreciation Rights . SARs provide for a payment, or payments, in cash or shares, to the holder based upon the difference between the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of exercise and the stated exercise price up to a maximum amount of cash or number of shares. These awards are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting as a result of termination of employment or failure to achieve certain vesting conditions. Performance Awards . A performance award is an award that covers an amount of cash or a number of shares that may be settled upon achievement of the pre-established performance conditions in cash or by issuance of the underlying shares. These awards are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting as a result of termination of employment or failure to achieve the performance conditions. 42 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Stock Bonus Awards . A stock bonus award is an award that covers a number of shares that may be granted as additional compensation for prior services or performance, in cash or by issuance of the underlying shares. Vesting conditions may or may not be applied to these awards. Additional Provisions Awards granted under the 2025 Plan may not be transferred in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or as determined by the Administrator. Unless otherwise restricted by the Administrator, awards that are non-statutory stock options may be exercised during the lifetime of the optionee only by the optionee, the optionee's guardian or legal representative, or a family member of the optionee who has acquired the option by a permitted transfer. Awards that are incentive stock options may be exercised during the lifetime of the optionee only by the optionee or the optionee's guardian or legal representative. Stock options granted under the 2025 Plan generally may be exercised for a period of three months after the termination of the optionee's service to us, except in the case of death or permanent disability, in which case the options may be exercised for up to twelve months or six months, respectively, following termination of the optionee's service to us. Unless otherwise set forth in a participant's award agreement, vesting of RSUs, RSAs, SARs, performance awards, and stock bonus awards ceases on such participant's termination of service. Change of Control or Other Corporate Transactions If we experience a change in control transaction, outstanding awards, including any vesting provisions, may be assumed or substituted by the successor company. Outstanding awards that are not assumed or substituted will accelerate (unless otherwise determined by the board) and will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Administrator. The vesting of shares underlying outstanding awards to our non-employee directors will accelerate in full prior to the consummation of such transaction. If the intrinsic value of a stock option or SAR is equal to or less than zero, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, provide for the cancellation of such awards without payment of any consideration therefor (for the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a change in control or other corporate transaction, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, terminate any stock option or SAR for which the exercise price is equal to or exceeds the per share value of the consideration to be paid in the change in control or other corporate transaction without payment of consideration therefor). In the event there is a specified type of change in our capital structure without our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split, appropriate adjustments will be made to the number of shares reserved under the 2025 Plan, the maximum number of shares that can be granted in a calendar year, and the number of shares and exercise price, if applicable, of all outstanding awards under the 2025 Plan. Repricing Without prior shareholder approval the Administrator may not seek to effect any re-pricing of any previously granted &#8220;underwater&#8221; stock option or similar award by: (i) amending or modifying the terms of the stock option or similar award to lower the exercise price; (ii) cancelling the underwater stock option or similar Award and granting either (A) replacement stock option or similar awards having a lower exercise price or (B) RSAs, RSUs, performance shares or similar awards in exchange; or (iii) cancelling or repurchasing the underwater stock options or similar awards for cash or other securities. A stock option or similar award will be deemed to be &#8220;underwater&#8221; at any time when the fair market value of the shares covered by such award is less than the exercise price of the award. Cancellation or Clawback of Awards The Administrator may, to the extent permitted by applicable law and stock exchange rules or by any of our policies (including our Compensation Recoupment Policy and any other policy necessary to comply with applicable laws), cancel or require reimbursement of any awards granted, shares issued, or cash received upon the vesting, exercise, or settlement of any awards granted to the participant or any shares issued or cash received upon vesting, exercise, or settlement of any such awards or sale of shares underlying such awards. Amendment and Termination If the 2025 Plan is approved by our shareholders, the 2025 Plan will terminate ten years following the Effective Date, unless it is terminated earlier by the board. The board may amend or terminate the 2025 Plan at any time, which may be without shareholder approval, unless required by applicable law or listing standards. Participants' awards will be governed by the version of the 2025 Plan in effect at the time such award was granted. 2025 Proxy Statement | 43 Table of Contents Federal Income Tax Consequences The following is a brief summary of the federal income tax consequences applicable to awards granted under the 2025 Plan based on federal income tax laws in effect on the date of this proxy statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters that may be relevant to a particular participant. The summary does not discuss the tax laws of any state, municipality, or foreign jurisdiction, or gift, estate, excise, payroll, or other tax laws other than federal income tax law. The following is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties. Because circumstances may vary, we advise all participants to consult their own tax advisors under all circumstances. Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) . An optionee generally realizes no taxable income upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. However, the exercise of an ISO may result in an alternative minimum tax liability to the employee. With some exceptions, a disposition of shares purchased under an ISO within two years from the date of grant or within one year after exercise produces ordinary income to the optionee equal to the value of the shares at the time of exercise less the exercise price. The same amount is deductible by the company as compensation, provided that the company reports the income to the optionee. Any additional gain recognized in the disposition is treated as a capital gain for which the company is not entitled to a deduction. However, if the optionee exercises an ISO and satisfies the holding period requirements, the company may not deduct any amount in connection with the ISO. If a sale or disposition of shares acquired with the ISO occurs after the holding period, the employee will recognize long-term capital gain or loss at the time of sale equal to the difference between proceeds realized and the exercise price paid. In general, an ISO that is exercised by the optionee more than three months after termination of employment is treated as an NQSO. ISOs are also treated as NQSOs to the extent that they first become exercisable by an individual in any calendar year for shares having a fair market value (determined as of the date of grant) in excess of $100,000. Non-Qualified Stock Options (NQSOs) . An optionee generally has no taxable income at the time of grant of an NQSO but realizes income in connection with the exercise of the option in an amount equal to the excess (at the time of exercise) of the fair market value of shares acquired upon exercise over the exercise price. The same amount is deductible by the company as compensation, provided that, in the case of an employee option, the company reports the income to the employee. Upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the shares, any recognized gain or loss after the date of exercise is treated as capital gain or loss for which the company is not entitled to a deduction. SARs . Generally, the recipient of a SAR will not recognize taxable income at the time the SAR is granted. If a participant receives the appreciation inherent in the SAR in cash, the cash will be taxed as ordinary income to the participant at the time it is received. If a participant receives the appreciation inherent in the SAR in shares, the spread between the then-current market value and the base price will be taxed as ordinary income to the participant at the time it is received. In general, there will be no federal income tax deduction allowed to the company upon the grant or termination of SARs. However, upon the settlement of a SAR, the company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income the recipient is required to recognize as a result of the settlement. Restricted Stock Awards . The recipient of a RSA will not recognize any taxable income for federal income tax purposes in the year of the award, provided that the shares are subject to restrictions (that is, they are nontransferable and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture). However, the recipient may elect under Section 83(b) of the Code to recognize compensation income in the year of the award in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of the award (less the purchase price, if any, paid for such shares), determined without regard to the restrictions. If a Section 83(b) election is made, the capital gain/loss holding period for such shares commences on the date of the award. Any further change in the value of the shares will be taxed as a capital gain or loss only if and when the shares are disposed of by the recipient. If the recipient does not make a Section 83(b) election, the fair market value of the shares on the date the restrictions lapse will be treated as compensation income to the recipient and will be taxable in the year the restrictions lapse, and the capital gain/ loss holding period for such shares will also commence on such date. Restricted Stock Units . No income generally will be recognized upon the award of RSUs. The recipient of an RSU generally will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates on the market price of unrestricted shares on the date that such shares are transferred to the participant under the award (reduced by any amount paid, if any, by the participant for such RSUs), and the capital gain/loss holding period for such shares will also commence on such date. Registration with the SEC If our shareholders approve the 2025 Plan, we will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8, as soon as reasonably practicable after the approval, to register the shares available for issuance under the 2025 Plan. New Plan Benefits 44 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Other than with respect to certain awards to be made to our non-employee directors under our Director Compensation Policy as described in the section entitled &#8220;Director Compensation,&#8221; the awards under the 2025 Plan are within the discretion of the Administrator. Furthermore, those certain awards to be made to our non-employee directors are determined based on the market price as described in the section entitled &#8220;Director Compensation.&#8221; As a result, the benefits that will be awarded under the 2025 Plan, including to our non-employee directors, are not determinable at this time. The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the adoption of the 2025 Equity Incentive Plan. Proposal Four : Advisory Vote on the Compensation Program of our Named Executive Officers In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are providing shareholders with a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers. This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a "say on pay" vote. The non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement, will be determined by the vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present or represented at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (Annual Meeting) and voting affirmatively or negatively on the proposal. Shareholders are urged to read the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement, which discusses how our executive compensation policies and practices implement our compensation philosophy and contains tabular information and narrative discussion about the compensation of our named executive officers. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee and our board of directors believe that these policies and practices are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our goals. Accordingly, our board of directors is asking the shareholders to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: RESOLVED , that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation awarded to Meta's named executive officers, as disclosed under SEC rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related narrative disclosures included in this proxy statement. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. However, our board of directors and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote on this proposal, and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee's executive compensation philosophy, policies, and determinations for our named executive officers, as described in the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement. Proposal Five : Advisory Vote on the Frequency of an Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation In addition to providing shareholders with a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers, and in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are also providing our shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on how frequently we should seek an advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers. This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a &#8220;say on frequency&#8221; vote. Under this proposal, our shareholders may cast a non-binding advisory vote on whether they would prefer to have a vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers every year, every two years, or every three years. Our board of directors believes that the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers should be conducted every three years, for the following reasons: &#8226; A substantial portion of executive compensation is in the form of long-term equity awards with performance periods of greater than three years. Triennial votes will allow our shareholders to evaluate the effectiveness of such long-term 2025 Proxy Statement | 45 Table of Contents compensation strategies and related business outcomes of our company for the corresponding period, while avoiding over-emphasis on short-term variations in compensation and business results. &#8226; We believe a triennial vote complements our goal of creating a compensation program that enhances long-term shareholder value. Shareholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the recommendation of our board of directors. Instead, shareholders may cast a vote on their preferred voting frequency by choosing any of the following four options with respect to this proposal: &#8220;one year,&#8221; &#8220;two years,&#8221; &#8220;three years,&#8221; or &#8220;Abstain.&#8221; For the reasons discussed above, we are asking our shareholders to vote for a frequency of &#8220;three years.&#8221; The option that receives the most votes cast at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be considered by our board of directors in determining the preferred frequency with which we will hold a shareholder vote to approve the compensation program for our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure. We held a non-binding advisory shareholder vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Over 85% of the voting power of shares voted at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders were cast in favor of our say on pay proposal. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. However, our board of directors and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote on this proposal, and will consider the option that receives the most votes in determining the frequency of future votes on the compensation program for our named executive officers. The board of directors recommends a vote for the option of a vote every THREE YEARS on the compensation program for our named executive officers. Executive Compensation COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Overview This section explains our executive compensation philosophy, objectives, and design; our compensation governance; our compensation-setting process; our executive compensation program elements; and the decisions made in 2024 with respect to the compensation of each of our named executive officers. Our named executive officers for 2024, who appear in the section entitled "&#8212;2024 Summary Compensation Table" below, are: Named Executive Officer Title Mark Zuckerberg Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Susan Li Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Christopher K. Cox Chief Product Officer (CPO) Javier Olivan Chief Operating Officer (COO) Andrew Bosworth Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Executive Compensation Philosophy, Objectives, and Design Philosophy . We are focused on our mission to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. We build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Across our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive, as well as creating new content and features for our metaverse and wearables products. For us to be successful, we design our executive compensation programs to attract and retain a talented team of engineering, product, sales, and business professionals who can help achieve this mission through the successful pursuit of our company priorities. In addition, we expect our executive team to possess and demonstrate strong leadership and management capabilities. For more information regarding our 2024 company priorities, see the section entitled "&#8212;Elements of Executive Compensation" below. Objectives. Our compensation program for our named executive officers is designed to support the following objectives: 46 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents &#8226; attract the top talent in our leadership positions and motivate our executives to deliver the highest level of individual and team impact and results; &#8226; encourage our executives to focus on our company priorities; &#8226; ensure each of our executives receives a total compensation package that encourages his or her long-term retention; &#8226; reward high levels of impact with commensurate levels of compensation; and &#8226; align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders in the overall success of our company by emphasizing long-term incentives. Design. Our executive compensation program continues to be heavily weighted towards equity compensation, in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs), with cash compensation that was generally below market relative to executive cash compensation at our peer companies in 2024. We believe that equity compensation offers the best vehicle to focus our executive officers on our mission and the successful pursuit of our company priorities, and to align their interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders. We typically grant our executive officers an annual equity award with service-based vesting conditions as discussed further in the section entitled "&#8212;Elements of Executive Compensation&#8212;Equity Compensation" below. When combined with the executives' prior equity awards, we believe that these additional awards represent a strong long-term retention tool and provide the executive officers with effective long-term equity incentives. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee evaluates our executive compensation program, including our mix of cash and equity compensation, on at least an annual basis. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate continuing to deliver the substantial majority of compensation in RSUs that vest over a minimum of four years. Compensation Governance The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee seeks to ensure sound executive compensation practices to adhere to our pay-for-performance philosophy while appropriately managing risk and aligning our executive compensation program with long-term shareholder interests. The following principles and practices were guiding factors during 2024: &#8226; the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is comprised solely of independent directors; &#8226; the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee engages an independent compensation consultant, Compensia, Inc. (Compensia), a national compensation consulting firm, to advise the committee on compensation-related matters; &#8226; the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee conducts an annual review and approval of our compensation strategy, including a review of our compensation-related risk profile to ensure that our compensation-related risks are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company; &#8226; the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee retains judgment on bonus payouts to enable it to respond to unforeseen events and adjust bonus payouts, as appropriate; and &#8226; our compensation philosophy and related governance features are complemented by several specific policies and practices that are designed to align our executive compensation program with long-term shareholder interests, including the following: &#9702; our executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines that require them to maintain significant ownership of our common stock; &#9702; our executives are subject to company-wide policies that prohibit trading in futures and derivative securities and engaging in hedging activities relating to our securities, holding our securities in margin accounts, pledging our securities as collateral for loans (unless otherwise approved by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee), and engaging in short sales of our securities; and &#9702; our executives participate in broad-based company-sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as our other full-time, salaried employees, with limited additional healthcare benefits for executives who are primarily located outside of the United States. 2025 Proxy Statement | 47 Table of Contents Compensation-Setting Process Role of Our Compensation, Nominating &amp; Governance Committee. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is responsible for overseeing all aspects of our executive compensation program, including executive salaries, payouts under our annual bonus plan (Bonus Plan), the size and structure of equity awards, and executive perquisites. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is solely responsible for determining the compensation of our CEO and reviews and approves the compensation of our other executive officers. For more information regarding the responsibilities of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, see the section entitled "Corporate Governance&#8212;Board Committees." Role of Management. In setting compensation for 2024, our CEO and our Head of People provided their views to the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee on how to implement our compensation philosophy through our executive compensation program and attended meetings of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. Our CEO made recommendations to the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee regarding compensation for our executive officers, other than for himself, because of his daily involvement with our executive team. No executive officer participated directly in the final deliberations or determinations regarding his or her own compensation package or was present during such determinations, except for our CEO who has requested that his base salary be fixed at $1 per year and does not receive any bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation. Our management team and the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans, practices, and policies for all employees, including our named executive officers, as further described in the section entitled "&#8212;Compensation Risk Assessment" below. Role of Compensation Consultant. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has the authority to engage its own advisors to assist in carrying out its responsibilities. In 2024, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee engaged the services of Compensia to advise the committee regarding the amount and types of compensation that we provide to our executive officers and how our compensation practices compared to the compensation practices of other companies. Compensia is engaged directly by the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. Compensia does not provide any services to us other than the services provided to the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has reviewed, and will continue to review going forward, the independence of Compensia under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules and believes that Compensia does not have any conflicts of interest in advising the committee. Use of Comparative Market Data. We aim to compensate our executive officers at levels that are commensurate with the most competitive levels of compensation for executives in similar positions at the group of publicly-traded peer companies set forth below, with whom we compete for hiring and retaining executive talent (our Peer Group). In making compensation decisions, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee also considers the scope of responsibility of each executive officer, our current practice of maintaining minimal differentiation between the cash compensation packages of our executive officers, the unvested balances of equity awards held by each executive officer, as well as the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee's assessment of each executive officer's performance and impact on the organization. In determining 2024 compensation, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee did not use a formula for taking into account these different factors. We analyze market data for executive compensation at least annually using the most relevant published survey sources, information available from public filings, and input from Compensia. Management and Compensia provided the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee with both cash and equity compensation data for our Peer Group for 2024, which was selected from companies that meet some or all of the criteria listed below: &#8226; technology or media company; &#8226; key talent competitor; &#8226; minimum revenue of $10 billion; and/or &#8226; minimum market capitalization of $50 billion. In the second quarter of 2023, using this criteria as a baseline, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee approved the following companies for inclusion in our Peer Group for 2024: 48 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 2024 Peer Group Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Netflix (NFLX) Amazon.com (AMZN) PayPal Holdings (PYPL) Apple (AAPL) salesforce.com (CRM) AT&amp;T (T) The Walt Disney Company (DIS) Cisco Systems (CSCO) Uber Technologies (UBER) Comcast (CMCSA) Verizon Communications (VZ) Microsoft (MSFT) In December 2023, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviewed our executive compensation against this Peer Group to ensure that our executive officer compensation was competitive and sufficient to recruit and retain our executive officers. Compensia provided the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee with an analysis of total cash compensation data (base salaries and cash bonus awards at target) and total direct compensation data (total cash compensation and equity compensation) at various percentiles. While the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considered this data in determining executive officer compensation, we did not seek to benchmark our executive compensation to any pre-set "target" percentile of the competitive market. Rather, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee sought to compensate our executive officers at a level that would allow us to successfully recruit and retain the best possible talent for our executive team. In light of the scale of our business, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee gives greater weight to the compensation levels of companies in our Peer Group that have higher revenue and market capitalization compared to other companies in the Peer Group when making decisions about the compensation of our executive officers. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee also relies on the knowledge and experience of its members and our management in determining the appropriate compensation levels for our executive officers. Overall, Compensia's analysis of our Peer Group indicated that the target total cash compensation for our named executive officers, other than our CEO, was below the 15th percentile of the companies in our Peer Group. When equity compensation was factored in, based on the "initial equity value" described below and without taking into account the effect of the deferred vesting start dates that are applicable to certain of the equity compensation awards of our named executive officers, the target total direct compensation for our named executive officers, other than our CEO, was at the 75th percentile relative to the companies in our Peer Group. In the second quarter of 2024, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviewed the selection criteria and the companies in our Peer Group. Following that review and in light of our revenue growth over the last several years, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee decided to update the selection criteria by increasing the minimum revenue threshold from $10 billion to $20 billion and the minimum market capitalization threshold from $50 billion to $100 billion. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee also approved changes to the composition of our Peer Group to reflect the updated selection criteria as well as the current competitive and talent environment. Accordingly, we plan to use the following list of companies in our Peer Group for the 2025 executive compensation process (our 2025 Peer Group): 2025 Peer Group Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) NVIDIA (NVDA) Amazon.com (AMZN) Oracle (ORCL) Apple (AAPL) salesforce.com (CRM) AT&amp;T (T) The Walt Disney Company (DIS) Cisco Systems (CSCO) Uber Technologies (UBER) Comcast (CMCSA) Verizon Communications (VZ) Microsoft (MSFT) Visa (V) Netflix (NFLX) The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee expects to periodically review and update our Peer Group and the underlying criteria as our business and market environment continue to evolve. Elements of Executive Compensation Our executive officer compensation packages generally include: 2025 Proxy Statement | 49 Table of Contents &#8226; base salary; &#8226; performance-based cash incentives; and &#8226; equity-based compensation in the form of RSUs. We believe that our compensation mix supports our objective of focusing on at-risk compensation having significant financial upside based on our performance relative to company priorities. We expect to continue to emphasize equity awards because of the direct link that equity compensation provides between shareholder interests and the interests of our executive officers, thereby motivating our executive officers to focus on increasing our value over the long term. Base Salary. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee believes base salaries are a necessary element of compensation in order to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviews the base salaries of our executive officers at least annually and may adjust them from time to time, if needed, to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors. Historically, our executive officers have received base salaries within a narrow range that was established when we were a smaller company with cash constraints, and based on our desire to maintain internal pay equity among our executive officers, as well as relative to other key employees. As we have grown, we have increased base salaries for our executive officers (other than our CEO), although we still deliver the substantial majority of compensation to our executive officers in the form of equity awards. In the first quarter of 2024, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee decided to increase the base salaries of our named executive officers, other than our CEO, in order to bring their salaries closer to those paid to executives holding similar positions at the companies in our Peer Group, as shown in the table below. Following these 2024 salary increases, these named executive officer salaries fell between the 40th and 60th percentiles of the salaries provided to executives holding similar positions at the companies in our Peer Group. Previously, Mr. Zuckerberg had requested to receive a base salary of $1 per year and the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee continued to honor this request in 2024.

(2) Amounts for Mr. Olivan calculated based on a USD-Euro exchange rate of 1.05485, which was the December 2024 exchange rate used by Meta for financial reporting purposes. Cash Bonuses. Our Bonus Plan for 2024 provides variable cash incentives, payable annually, that are designed to motivate our executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements. In 2024, the individual target bonus percentage for each named executive officer was unchanged from 2023 at 75% of each such executive's base salary. After the 2024 base salary increases noted above, target total cash compensation (base salary plus target bonus) for our named executive officers (other than our CEO) was between the bottom and 15th percentiles of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions at the companies in our Peer Group. All of our named executive officers, except our CEO, participated in the Bonus Plan in 2024. For the annual performance period in 2024, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee approved a set of company priorities in order to focus our executive officers on key areas of performance. The 2024 company priorities reflect operational and non-operational objectives established by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, in consultation with our CEO and CFO. The company priorities did not have specific target levels associated with them for purposes of determining performance under the Bonus Plan, and our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee had full judgment to determine the level of bonus payout for the performance period. 50 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 2024 Bonus Plan Payouts. We calculate Bonus Plan payouts to each executive officer using the following formula: Base Eligible Earnings x Target Bonus Percentage x Company Performance Percentage = Bonus Payout Our Bonus Plan provides for the payment of executive officer bonuses based solely on the company performance percentage, and not on an individual performance percentage. We believe this structure aligns executive officer interests with the interests of our shareholders in the overall success of our company, promotes focus on the ultimate impact of each individual on the collective success of the organization, and incentivizes increasing our value over the long term. 2024 Priorities and Company Performance Percentage. Our 2024 company priorities as approved by the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee were as follows: Build awesome things. Make our business successful. Make progress on societal issues related to our business. Go out and tell our story. None of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the target bonus. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee exercised its judgment in determining the company performance percentage for our 2024 performance after considering our delivery of results across all of the areas identified as company priorities. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviewed the progress that we made in 2024, including product launches such as our Llama 3 models and Instagram Teen Accounts, continued scaling of Meta AI, and solid growth and engagement across our family of apps, ending the year with over 3.3 billion Family daily active people. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee also took into account our strong financial performance, including our 2024 total revenue of $164.5 billion, which represented a 22% year-over-year increase. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee approved a company performance percentage of 125% for 2024. 2024 Bonus Payouts. The following table summarizes the calculations that were used in determining the cash bonus paid to each of our named executive officers for 2024 (other than Mr. Zuckerberg, who does not participate in the Bonus Plan): Named Executive Officer Performance Period Base Eligible Earnings&#160;($) (1) Target Bonus Percentage (%) Company Performance Percentage (%) Bonus Payout&#160;($) Susan Li 2024 &#160;936,346 75 125 877,826 Christopher K.

(2) Amounts for Mr. Olivan calculated based on a USD-Euro exchange rate of 1.05485, which was the December 2024 exchange rate used by Meta for financial reporting purposes. 2025 Proxy Statement | 51 Table of Contents In February 2025, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee decided to increase the target bonus percentage under the Bonus Plan for each of our named executive officers, other than our CEO, from 75% of each such named executive officer's base salary to 200% of each named executive officer's base salary, effective beginning with the 2025 annual performance period under the Bonus Plan. In approving this increase, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considered that the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers, other than the CEO, was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions in our 2025 Peer Group. Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers, other than the CEO, falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the salaries provided to executives holding similar positions at the companies in our 2025 Peer Group. Equity Compensation. Most of our executive officers' target total direct compensation is delivered through equity awards in the form of RSUs. We use equity compensation to align our executive officers' financial interests with those of our shareholders, to attract industry leaders of the highest caliber, and to retain them for the long term. In addition to the initial equity award that each executive officer receives as part of his or her new hire compensation package, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee typically grants our executive officers additional equity awards each year as part of our company-wide equity refresher program. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee exercises its judgment in determining additional equity awards for each of our executive officers, taking into account the following factors: &#8226; delivering equity values that are highly competitive when compared against those granted to executives with similar responsibilities at the companies in our Peer Group that have higher revenue and market capitalization when compared to other companies in our Peer Group; &#8226; each executive officer's individual performance assessment, the results and contributions delivered during the year, as well as the anticipated potential future impact of each individual executive; &#8226; the size and vesting schedule of existing equity awards in order to maximize the long-term retentive power of all additional awards; and &#8226; the size of each executive officer's target total cash compensation (base salary plus cash bonus awards at target), which is generally significantly lower than the cash compensation for executives with similar responsibilities at the companies in our Peer Group. Based on the foregoing factors, in March 2024, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee granted each of our executive officers, other than our CEO, an award of RSUs with a specific "initial equity value" based on an estimated total value for each award. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee calculated the number of RSUs to be granted by dividing this initial equity value by $466.53 per share, which was the average closing price for the seven trading days following the announcement of our earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the same price that was used for 2024 refresher awards to all other employees, and rounding up to the nearest whole share. The 2024 RSU awards will vest quarterly over four years following the vesting start dates as described in the section entitled "&#8212;2024 Equity Awards" below. Equity Grant Practices. We maintain an equity award policy which establishes consistent policies and procedures with respect to the timing, structure, and process for the grant of equity-based awards, including for purposes of annual equity grants to our named executive officers. The grant date of our annual equity awards to our named executive officers is generally March 20th (or the next following trading date). Equity awards are not spring-loaded or otherwise timed to take advantage of material non-public information. 2024 Equity Awards. Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg did not receive any equity awards in 2024 because our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee believed that his existing equity ownership position continued to sufficiently align his interests with those of our shareholders. Our other named executive officers received the following RSU awards in 2024: Named Executive Officer Initial Equity Value ($) Number of RSUs (#) (1) Initial Vesting Date Susan Li 20,000,000 42,870 May 15, 2024 Christopher K. Cox 20,000,000 42,870 May 15, 2024 Javier Olivan 20,000,000 42,870 May 15, 2024 Andrew Bosworth 20,000,000 42,870 February 15, 2026 (1) The number of RSUs was calculated by dividing the initial equity value by $466.53, which was the same value used for 2024 refresher awards to all other employees in March 2024, and rounding up to the nearest whole share. 52 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents The RSUs granted to our named executive officers are subject to a four-year quarterly vesting schedule, with 1/16th of the RSUs vesting on the initial vesting date noted above and the remainder vesting quarterly thereafter, subject to continued employment through each vesting date. Following the grants of these equity awards in March 2024 and based on the "initial equity value" set forth above, the target total direct compensation for our named executive officers, other than our CEO, was at the 75th percentile relative to the companies in our Peer Group. PERQUISITES AND OTHER BENEFITS We provide certain perquisites to our named executive officers for the reasons described below. In approving these perquisites, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considered comparative Peer Group and other market data provided by Compensia. Because of the high visibility of our company, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has authorized an "overall security program" for Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder, CEO, Chairman, and controlling shareholder. We require these security measures for the company's benefit because of the importance of Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg to Meta, and we believe that the scope and costs of this security program are appropriate and necessary. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee evaluates this security program at least annually, including a review of security professional assessments of safety threats and recommendations for the security programs. Since the implementation of Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg's overall security program, each of these assessments has identified specific threats to Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg as a result of the high-profile nature of being our founder, CEO, Chairman, and controlling shareholder. We believe that Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg's role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most-recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention. Under Mr. Zuckerberg's overall security program, we pay for costs related to personal security for Mr. Zuckerberg at his residences and during personal travel, including the annual costs of security personnel for his protection and the procurement, installation, and maintenance of certain security measures for his residences.&#160;We provide an annual pre-tax allowance of $14 million to Mr. Zuckerberg to cover additional costs related to his and his family's personal security. This security allowance is paid to Mr. Zuckerberg net of required tax withholdings, and Mr. Zuckerberg must apply the net amount towards additional personnel, equipment, services, residential improvements, health and safety services, or other security-related costs. Although Mr. Zuckerberg expects to use the full net amount during each calendar year in which the allowance is paid, he may apply any unused portion of the allowance for a given year to cover excess security-related costs in future years or prior years (no earlier than 2018). In addition, Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg uses private aircraft for personal travel in connection with his overall security program (including a private aircraft that is indirectly and wholly owned by Mr. Zuckerberg and operated by an independent charter company). On certain occasions, Mr.&#160;Zuckerberg may be accompanied by guests when using private aircraft. We pay for travel by Mr. Zuckerberg on the aircraft owned by Mr. Zuckerberg under our Charter and Time Sharing Arrangements pursuant to a written policy overseen by our audit &amp; risk oversight committee and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, as described in the section entitled "Related Party Transactions." Although we do not consider Mr. Zuckerberg's overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit for the reasons described above, the costs related to personal security for Mr. Zuckerberg at his residences and during personal travel pursuant to his overall security program, as well as the annual security allowance and the costs of private aircraft for personal travel, are reported as compensation to Mr. Zuckerberg in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "&#8212;2024 Summary Compensation Table" below. The costs of Mr. Zuckerberg's security program vary from year to year depending on requisite security measures, his travel schedule, and other factors. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee believes that these costs are appropriate and necessary in light of the threat landscape and the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg has requested to receive only $1 in annual salary and does not receive any bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation. In addition, in 2024, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee approved costs related to facilities improvements at the company&#8217;s property to facilitate efficient travel by Mr. Zuckerberg, which costs are reported as other compensation to Mr. Zuckerberg in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "&#8212;2024 Summary Compensation Table" below. From time to time, we also provide certain personal security measures to other executive officers in response to specific security threats in light of their roles at our company, including pre-tax security allowances, as well as certain costs related to personal security at their residences and related tax gross-ups. The costs related to personal security for our executive officers 2025 Proxy Statement | 53 Table of Contents are reported as other compensation to them in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "&#8212;2024 Summary Compensation Table" below. 2022 SAY ON PAY VOTE We held a non-binding advisory shareholder vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a "say on pay" vote, at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Over 85% of the votes cast at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders were in favor of our say on pay proposal. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considered the result of this advisory vote as well as the direct feedback heard in shareholder engagement discussions when making compensation decisions for our named executive officers. After considering all of these inputs as well as the desire to have the same overall compensation program structure for all employees and attract and retain the best talent, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee determined to maintain the same overall compensation program design for 2024. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say on pay votes and shareholder feedback when making compensation decisions for our named executive officers, including the outcome of Proposal Four (non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers) at this Annual Meeting. Based on the results of a separate non-binding advisory shareholder vote on the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes regarding the compensation program for our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a "say on frequency" vote, held at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our board of directors determined that we will hold our say on pay vote every three years until the next required say on frequency vote. We are holding our say on pay vote and our say on frequency vote at this Annual Meeting. For more information, see Proposal Four (advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers) and Proposal Five (advisory vote on the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation). TAX DEDUCTIBILITY Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits the amount that we may deduct from our federal income taxes for compensation paid to certain executive officers, including our named executive officers, to $1 million per executive officer per year. While our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is mindful of the benefit to us of the full tax deductibility of compensation, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of Section 162(m) where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our named executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives. Therefore, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee may approve compensation that may not be fully deductible because of the limits of Section 162(m). Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee intends to continue to compensate our named executive officers in a manner it believes is consistent with the best interests of our company and our shareholders. COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT Our management team and the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee each play a role in evaluating, monitoring, and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans, practices, and policies for all employees, including our named executive officers. In early 2025, our management, with input from Compensia, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee's independent compensation consultant, performed an assessment, of our compensation plans, practices, and policies and concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has reviewed this report and agreed with the conclusion. The objective of the assessment was to identify any compensation plans, practices, or policies that may encourage employees to take unnecessary risks that could threaten the company. No such plans, practices, or policies were identified. The risk assessment process included, among other things, a review of our cash and equity incentive-based compensation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our company performance goals and the overall compensation to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay components and between short-term and long-term incentives. 54 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND TRANSACTIONS IN OUR SECURITIES Stock Ownership Guidelines To further align the interests of our executive officers and directors with those of our shareholders, and based on the recommendation of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, in September 2018, our board of directors adopted minimum stock ownership guidelines applicable to our executive officers and non-employee directors, which were most recently amended effective as of June 2023. Under these guidelines, our executive officers are required to own the lesser of (x) 24,400 shares and (y) shares with an equivalent value of $4.0 million by the later of (i) September 2023 or (ii) five years from becoming an executive officer, and our non-employee directors are required to own the lesser of (x) 4,570 shares and (y) shares with an equivalent value of $750,000 by the later of (i) May 2025 or (ii) five years from becoming a non-employee director; provided, that non-employee directors who were serving as of May 2020 continue to be subject to the prior minimum stock ownership guidelines and are required to own the lesser of (x) 3,050 shares and (y) shares with an equivalent value of $500,000 by the later of (i) September 2023 or (ii) five years from becoming a non-employee director. The stock ownership guidelines also provide that if an executive officer or director&#8217;s stock ownership falls below the target ownership levels described above due to circumstances beyond his or her control (such as significant declines in our stock price), he or she will be limited to selling no more than 50% of shares acquired by him or her following the time that his or her stock ownership dropped below the target ownership levels (excluding any shares withheld by the company for purposes of satisfying applicable tax obligations) until such time as he or she has again achieved the applicable target ownership levels. As of December 31, 2024, all of our executive officers and non-employee directors either met the applicable ownership threshold or were within the permitted time period to attain the required ownership. As our CEO and controlling shareholder, Mr. Zuckerberg currently has stock ownership significantly in excess of the required ownership threshold. As a result, our stock ownership guidelines provide that our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee will reassess appropriate ownership requirements applicable to Mr. Zuckerberg in his capacity as an executive officer if in the future his stock holdings fall below one percent of our total outstanding capital stock. Clawback Policy Our Compensation Recoupment Policy allows us to recoup certain incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under U.S. federal securities laws. The Compensation Recoupment Policy is included as Exhibit 97.1 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Restrictions on Transactions in Our Securities We have adopted insider trading policies and procedures applicable to our directors, officers, employees, and other covered persons, and have implemented processes for the company, that we believe are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and Nasdaq listing standards. Our policies prohibit the following transactions: trading in futures and derivative securities and engaging in hedging activities relating to our securities, including exchange traded options, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds, or other arrangements or instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of our securities; engaging in short sales of our securities; holding our securities in margin accounts; and pledging our securities as collateral for loans unless otherwise approved by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee and our board of directors have approved a framework for a pledging arrangement by Mark Zuckerberg that is designed to mitigate the risk of a forced stock sale. Under the terms of the arrangement, (i) the total number of shares of our common stock pledged must not exceed 20% of the total number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Zuckerberg, and (ii) the aggregate loan amount collateralized by such pledged shares must not exceed 5% of the fair market value of the total number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Zuckerberg at the time of any borrowing. In light of the considerations set forth above, we believe Mr. Zuckerberg's pledging arrangement does not pose a material risk to Meta or its shareholders. In reviewing the pledging arrangement, our audit &amp; risk oversight committee, compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, and board of directors considered the following factors, in addition to peer company practices and other relevant information regarding pledging arrangements: Mr. Zuckerberg's significant holdings in our common stock; the amount of the pledge as compared to the total value of common stock held by Mr. Zuckerberg; Mr. Zuckerberg's ability to repay the loan without recourse to the pledged shares; the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg receives a salary of only $1 per year and no bonus payments, equity awards, or other incentive compensation; and the fact that maintaining ownership over pledged shares promotes alignment between Mr. Zuckerberg's interests and the long-term interests of our shareholders. 2025 Proxy Statement | 55 Table of Contents Pursuant to the approval by our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee and our board of directors, Mr. Zuckerberg previously pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain indebtedness. Mr. Zuckerberg has pledged 12,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, representing approximately 3.5% of the total shares beneficially owned by Mr. Zuckerberg and 0.5% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock, and approximately 2.1% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock, in each case as of April&#160;1, 2025. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans Our executive officers and directors are required to conduct all purchase or sale transactions under a trading plan established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, the executive officer or director contracts with a broker to buy or sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis. The broker then executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the executive officer or director when entering into the plan, without further direction from them. The executive officer or director may amend or terminate the plan in specified circumstances. Our requirement to conduct all purchase or sale transactions under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan generally includes transactions in shares held through trusts and other entities controlled by our executive officers and directors, but excludes certain transactions by venture capital investment entities that may be affiliated with our directors. Such requirements may be waived by our board of directors, compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee, or compliance officer in consultation with legal counsel. 56 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents 2024 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE The following table presents summary information regarding the total compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to each of the named executive officers for services rendered to us for the years ended December&#160;31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Name and Principal Position Fiscal Year Salary ($) (1) Bonus ($) (2) Stock Awards ($) (3) All Other Compensation ($) Total ($) Mark Zuckerberg 2024 1 &#8212; &#8212; 27,219,873 (4) 27,219,874&#160; Chief Executive Officer 2023 1 &#8212; &#8212; 24,399,967 (4) 24,399,968&#160; 2022 1 &#8212; &#8212; 27,110,417 (4) 27,110,418&#160; Susan Li 2024 946,731 877,826 21,671,642 124,289 (5) 23,620,488&#160; Chief Financial Officer 2023 871,154 980,049 21,493,046 111,958 (5) 23,456,207&#160; 2022 722,338 575,613 13,882,838 28,698 (5) 15,209,487&#160; Christopher K.

In addition, each of our named executive officers has executed a form of our standard confidential information and invention assignment agreement. Mark Zuckerberg We entered into an amended and restated offer letter with Mr. Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, effective January&#160;2012. This offer letter agreement has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment. Mr. Zuckerberg's annual base salary as of December 31, 2024 was $1, and he is not eligible to receive bonus compensation under our Bonus Plan. Susan Li We entered into an offer letter with Ms. Li, our CFO, effective November 2022. The offer letter agreement has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment. Ms. Li's annual base salary as of December 31, 2024 was $945,000, and she is eligible to receive annual bonus compensation under our Bonus Plan. Christopher K.

Javier Olivan We entered into an offer letter with Mr. Olivan, our COO, effective December 2022. The offer letter agreement has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment.

The offer letter agreement has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment. Mr. Bosworth's annual base salary as of December 31, 2024 was $995,000, and he is eligible to receive annual bonus compensation under our Bonus Plan. POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL None of our named executive officers is entitled to payments or acceleration of vesting with respect to equity awards held by such named executive officers in connection with a termination or a change in control. However, consistent with our policy that is generally applicable to all employees, the designated beneficiaries of each of our named executive officers are entitled to the cash-out of outstanding unvested RSUs upon his or her death (up to a maximum payout of $2,000,000 per officer). In addition, Mr. Olivan may be entitled to payments upon a termination of employment pursuant to applicable local law. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION MATTERS Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors and officers for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she serves or served in such capacity at our request to the maximum extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable law and allow us to indemnify other officers, employees, and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable law. We have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into separate indemnification agreements with our directors, executive officers, and other key employees, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and other applicable law. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors, executive officers, and other key employees for certain expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and settlement amounts actually and reasonably incurred by such person in any action or proceeding arising out of their services to us, or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request, including liability arising out of negligence or active or passive wrongdoing by the officer, director or employee. We believe that these charter provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons such as directors, officers and key employees. We also maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other shareholders. Further, a shareholder's investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), may be permitted to directors, executive officers or persons controlling us, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. CEO PAY RATIO For the year ended December 31, 2024: &#8226; the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO) was $417,400; and &#8226; the annual total compensation of our CEO was $27,219,874. Based on this information, for 2024, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 65:1. We believe this ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 2025 Proxy Statement | 61 Table of Contents As permitted by SEC rules, to identify our median employee for 2024, we selected total direct compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure, which we calculated as actual salary paid to our employees for 2024 (including overtime for hourly employees), actual bonus or sales commission earned by our employees in 2024, and the value of equity awards granted to our employees in 2024. Further, we used October 31, 2024 to determine our employee population and used the consistently applied compensation measure as described above to determine our median employee. In determining this population, we included all worldwide full-time and part-time employees other than our CEO. We did not include any contractors or workers employed through a third-party provider in our employee population. For employees paid in other than U.S. dollars, we converted their compensation to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates used by us for various purposes in effect on October 31, 2024. Based on this approach, we selected the individual who represented the median employee for 2024. We then calculated the annual total compensation for this individual using the same methodology we used for our named executive officers in our 2024 Summary Compensation Table. Although we identified a new median employee for 2024, our calculation methodology for 2024 was the same methodology used to calculate our 2023 pay ratio. During 2024, Mr. Zuckerberg served as our CEO, and per his request received $1 in salary. He does not participate in our Bonus Plan nor did he receive any equity awards. Therefore, the substantial majority of his annual total compensation as reported in our 2024 Summary Compensation Table consisted of costs related to personal security for Mr. Zuckerberg at his residences and during personal travel pursuant to his overall security program, his annual security allowance, and costs related to personal usage of private aircraft. For more information regarding these matters, see the section entitled "Executive Compensation&#8212;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Perquisites and Other Benefits" above.

Tabular List of Performance Measures The following table sets forth the financial performance measure that we use to link compensation actually paid to our named executive officers to the company&#8217;s performance, as further described below. Financial Performance Measure Revenue Analysis of the Information Presented in the Pay Versus Performance Table Our executive compensation program continues to be heavily weighted towards equity compensation with service-based vesting, with cash compensation that is generally below market relative to executive cash compensation at our peer companies. We believe that equity compensation offers the best vehicle to focus our executive officers on our mission and the successful pursuit of our company priorities, and to align their interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Our Bonus Plan provides variable cash incentives that are designed to motivate our executive officers to focus on company priorities. Our Bonus Plan design does not have specific financial performance metrics and the company priorities are not assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the target bonus. Our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee takes a holistic view of company priorities and performance when determining payout levels for our executive officers. In 2024, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee took into account the company's financial performance, and in particular revenue, when determining the company performance percentage for payouts under the Bonus Plan. However, as described above, company financial performance was not assigned any specific metrics or weighting or dollar amount of the target bonus. See the section entitled "&#8212;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Elements of Executive Compensation&#8212;Cash Bonuses" for more information.

Based solely on our review of the reports filed during 2024 and questionnaires from our directors and executive officers, we determined that no director, executive officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10% of our Class A common stock failed to file a report on a timely basis during 2024. Report of the Compensation, Nominating &amp; Governance Committee This report of the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, in accordance with the SEC's rules, will not be deemed to be part of or incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference, and will not otherwise be deemed "soliciting material" or "filed" under either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and based on such review and discussions, the compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee recommended to our board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. THE COMPENSATION, NOMINATING &amp; GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE Peggy Alford (Chair) Marc L. Andreessen Andrew W. Houston Tony Xu 66 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Director Compensation NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS Our board of directors and shareholders have adopted a Director Compensation Policy that sets out the annual compensation for our non-employee directors and is designed to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors, which we believe is critical to our long-term success. Our Director Compensation Policy provides for cash retainers, excess meeting fees, initial equity grants upon joining our board of directors, and annual equity grants. We believe our Director Compensation Policy allows us to appropriately compensate directors for: &#8226; the heavy workload resulting from an increase in the number of board and committee meetings over the past several years, and the significant responsibilities of the various committees of our board of directors; &#8226; the external scrutiny faced by our non-employee directors, which is expected to be ongoing; and &#8226; service in demanding board leadership roles, such as our Lead Independent Director and committee chairs. On an annual basis, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee reviews and makes recommendations to our board of directors regarding our non-employee director compensation arrangements, and our board of directors reviews and approves non-employee director compensation. As part of this review, our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee considers our directors' responsibilities and time commitment, as well as information regarding director compensation paid at peer companies, including an evaluation by its independent compensation consultant, Compensia, Inc. CASH COMPENSATION The following table presents the annual cash retainers payable to non-employee members of our board of directors in 2024 under our Director Compensation Policy: Annual Cash Retainers Annual retainer for service as a member of our board of directors $50,000 Additional annual retainer for service as Lead Independent Director $150,000 Additional annual retainers for service on committees of our board of directors Chair of our audit &amp; risk oversight committee $50,000 Non-chair member of our audit &amp; risk oversight committee $20,000 Chair of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee $25,000 Non-chair member of our compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee $10,000 Chair of our privacy &amp; product compliance committee $50,000 Non-chair member of our privacy &amp; product compliance committee $20,000 Each of these cash retainers is paid on a quarterly basis in advance of service for each quarter. Annual cash retainers for new non-employee directors who join our board of directors between our annual meetings of shareholders are prorated during a director's first year of service. In addition, each non-employee member of our board of directors (other than Mr. Andreessen) who attends more than four meetings of our board of directors or more than four meetings of any standing committee in a calendar year (in each case beginning in 2020) receives an excess meeting fee of $4,000 for attendance at each meeting of our board of directors and applicable committee after the fourth meeting within such calendar year. Excess meeting fees are paid promptly following the end of such calendar year. Mr. Andreessen irrevocably waived the increases in cash and equity compensation beginning in 2020, and therefore is granted cash compensation on the same terms as his cash compensation during 2019. EQUITY COMPENSATION Annual Equity Grants 2025 Proxy Statement | 67 Table of Contents Members of our board of directors as of the date of our annual meeting of shareholders are also eligible to receive an annual grant of RSUs with an initial equity value of $375,000 (including directors who join the board of directors on the date of such annual meeting, but excluding Mr. Andreessen). Mr. Andreessen, who irrevocably waived the increases in cash and equity compensation beginning in 2020, is eligible to receive an annual grant of RSUs with an initial equity value of $300,000. These awards are approved each year automatically on the later of June 1 or the date of our annual meeting of shareholders for the particular year. These awards will vest fully on the earlier of (i) May 15 of the following year or (ii) the date of our annual meeting of shareholders of the following year if the director does not stand for re-election or is not re-elected at such annual meeting, so long as the recipient is a director on such date. In 2024, following our annual meeting of shareholders, we made an annual grant of 802 RSUs to each non-employee director (other than Mr. Andreessen), which was based on an initial equity value of $375,000. In addition, we made an annual grant of 642 RSUs to Mr. Andreessen based on an initial equity value of $300,000. Initial Equity Grants New non-employee directors who join our board of directors between our annual meetings of shareholders are eligible to receive a one-time grant of RSUs at the time of their appointment with an initial equity value equal to the value of our annual grant of RSUs to our non-employee directors ($375,000), prorated for service from the date of their appointment through the next occurring May 15. These awards will vest fully on the earlier of (i) the next occurring May 15 or (ii) the date of our annual meeting of shareholders of the following year if the director does not stand for re-election or is not re-elected at such annual meeting, so long as the recipient is a director on such date. In addition, each new non-employee director who joins our board of directors is eligible to receive a one-time grant of RSUs at the time of their appointment with an initial equity value equal to $1 million. These awards will vest over approximately a four-year period in 16 equal quarterly installments. ANNUAL LIMIT ON DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Our Director Compensation Policy limits aggregate compensation (including both cash and equity-based compensation) payable to each non-employee director to $1,000,000 per year, except during such non-employee director's first year of service on our board of directors, in which case, such limit is $2,000,000 to account for the receipt of the initial equity grants to new non-employee directors (Director Compensation Limit). DIRECTOR SECURITY In light of the high level of scrutiny and elevated threat level faced by our company and our directors, from time to time, we may provide personal security services to our non-employee directors and related tax gross-ups. As such services are non-compensatory in nature, they are not taken into consideration for any reason pursuant to our Director Compensation Policy, including when determining whether a non-employee director's compensation exceeds the Director Compensation Limit in any fiscal year. DIRECTOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN In December 2022, our board of directors adopted the Meta Platforms, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Deferred Compensation Plan), pursuant to which our non-employee directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their cash fees (including annual retainers and meeting fees) and/or grants of RSUs. The deferred cash fees will be deferred into one or more investment funds offered under the Deferred Compensation Plan and the RSUs will be treated as deferred RSUs that continue to be settled in our Class A common stock. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan shall be paid or settled, at the election of the director, following either (i) the non-employee director&#8217;s separation from service or (ii) a specified date, and in either (i) a lump sum or (ii) up to 10 equal annual installments. For 2024, Mr. Arnold and Ambassador Kimmitt elected to defer eligible cash fees and RSUs granted in 2024, in each case pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan. STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND TRANSACTIONS IN OUR SECURITIES Our directors are also subject to stock ownership guidelines and certain prohibitions on transactions in our securities.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the following table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 2,181,270,402 shares of Class A common stock and 343,179,151 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at April&#160;1, 2025. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options, restricted stock units (RSUs) or other convertible securities held by that person that are currently exercisable or releasable or that will become exercisable or releasable within 60 days of April&#160;1, 2025. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

If the proponents of these proposals, or representatives who are qualified under state law, are present at our Annual Meeting and submit the proposals for a vote, then the proposals will be voted upon. The text of the Shareholder Proposals and supporting statements appear exactly as received from the proponents unless otherwise noted. All statements contained in the Shareholder Proposals and supporting statements are the sole responsibility of the proponents. The Shareholder Proposals may contain assertions about our company or other matters that we believe are incorrect, but we have not attempted to refute all such assertions. The response from our board of directors and the recommendation on each proposal is presented immediately following each proposal. Information contained on or accessible through any website links included in the Shareholder Proposals, supporting statements, and the responses from our board of directors is not incorporated in, and does not constitute a part of, this proxy statement. Each Shareholder Proposal is required to be voted on at our Annual Meeting only if properly presented. Meta has a robust shareholder engagement program in which our board of directors and management team discuss key topics, including corporate governance, content governance, platform safety, and human capital management, with our institutional investors. The board of directors, in considering how to respond and recommend that shareholders vote on each proposal, takes into account a number of factors, including engagement dialogue between the proponents and the company; the expressed preferences of our shareholders; the company's current practices; whether in their judgment a proposal is in the best interests of the company; the cost, feasibility and risks associated with implementation of the shareholder proposal request; prior shareholder support for related topics; and peer and market practices. Incorporating these factors, and taking into account discussion with members of our senior management and internal subject matter experts, our board of directors has considered each of the Shareholder Proposals listed below and recommends voting AGAINST each of them for the reasons set forth in their response statements. We will promptly provide our shareholders with the name, address, and, to our knowledge, the number of voting securities held by the proponents of the Shareholder Proposals, upon receiving a written request sent to us by one of the following ways: (1) via mail directed to: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, Attention: Secretary, with a copy via email to CorporateSecretary@meta.com, or (2) via email only delivered to our Secretary at CorporateSecretary@meta.com. Proposal Six: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Dual Class Capital Structure The proponents of this resolution are lead filer Northstar Asset Management, Inc. Funded Pension Plan and co-filer Mercy Investment Services, Inc. Give Each Share an Equal Vote RESOLVED : Shareholders request that our Board take all practicable steps in its control to initiate and adopt a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have one vote per share. We recommend that this be done through a phase-out process in which the board would, within seven years or other timeframe justified by the board, establish fair and appropriate mechanisms through which disproportionate rights of Class B shareholders could be eliminated. This is not intended to unnecessarily limit our Board's judgment in crafting the requested change in accordance with applicable laws and existing contracts. SUPPORTING STATEMENT : Since its creation, Meta Platforms ("Meta"), formerly Facebook, has faced numerous headline-grabbing scandals and controversies that have resulted in immense material loss. This includes the loss of users, decline in user confidence, and stock price drops that wiped off &#8220;more than $119bn &#8230; [from] Facebook&#8217;s market value&#8221; 1 in one day. Shareholders believe that proper governance reforms are needed to help the company avoid future scandals. 1 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/26/facebook-market-cap-falls-109bn-dollars-after-growth-shock 2025 Proxy Statement | 73 Table of Contents The list of controversies and allegations include criticism for &#8220;lax position on political lies,&#8221; misinformation, data breaches, censoring of and retaliation against employees 2 , damages to child mental health, failing to prevent its platforms from being used to incite violence, and more. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who currently controls the majority of the shareholder vote while owning only 14% of the economic value of the firm, dictates the course of the company. In testimony before the Senate, whistleblower Frances Haugen alleged that &#8220;there is no one currently holding Zuckerberg accountable but himself.&#8221; 3 Persistent scandals continue to plague our company who was recently fined 1.3 billion dollars by the European Union, the latest in a decades long data privacy case involving weak protections for users&#8217; personal information. 4 Just a few weeks ago the European Union also fined our company 800 million euros for antitrust violations involving Marketplace online advertisements. An investigation found that our company exploited its market position and engaged in anti-competitive conduct. 5 The Company has said it will appeal the decision. Given the company&#8217;s history of issues with protecting user privacy, strong company governance is critical as Meta moves forward into the increasingly complex virtual landscape. Without equal voting rights, shareholders cannot hold management accountable to good governance. Governance experts support the recapitalization sought by this proposal: the Council for Institutional Investors (CII) recommends a seven-year phase-out of dual class share offerings and the International Corporate Governance Network supports CII&#8217;s recommendation. Outside shareholders have repeatedly widely supported this proposal as evident by their 84% support for this proposal in 2024. We urge shareholders to vote FOR a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have one vote per share. META BOARD RESPONSE &#8226; Our board of directors evaluates Meta&#8217;s capital structure on a regular basis and continues to believe that our current capital structure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. &#8226; Our current capital structure allows our board of directors and management team to focus on the long term. &#8226; Our board of directors provides robust independent oversight and ensures that the interests of our shareholders are considered. &#8226; The requested change to our capital structure is unnecessary and is not in the best interest of Meta and its shareholders at this time. Our board of directors evaluates Meta&#8217;s capital structure on a regular basis and continues to believe that our current capital structure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing, and considering evolving corporate governance best practices on a regular basis, in addition to reviewing the company&#8217;s major corporate governance-related risk exposures, including those related to our capital structure. As a result of the committee&#8217;s findings, the full board of directors continues to believe that our current capital structure is appropriate for Meta at this time. Our current capital structure allows our board of directors and management team to focus on the long term. We are focused on our mission to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. If we focus on this mission and build useful and engaging products and services, we believe we will create the most value for our shareholders over the long term. Our board of directors believes that our capital structure allows the company to focus on our mission and long-term success. Various studies have shown that multi-class structures do not hinder company performance and can support strong results because of management&#8217;s ability to focus on the maximization of long-term returns. 2 https://www.aljazeera.com/podcasts/2024/10/24/the-take-uncovering-metas-censorship-policies-on-palestine 3 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-frances-haugen-testimony.html 4 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/16/eu-investigates-facebook-owner-meta-over-child-safety-and-mentalhealth-concerns 5 https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-european-union-competition-fine-6886192353a344126a15886d6ca7c627 74 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Our board of directors provides robust independent oversight and ensures that the interests of our shareholders are considered. We believe that our current board structure is effective in promoting strong independent board leadership. Our Lead Independent Director role is modeled on the role of an independent board chair, and designed to ensure a strong, independent, and active board. Ambassador Robert Kimmitt currently serves as our Lead Independent Director and provides an appropriate counterbalance to our Chairman and CEO. Further, a substantial majority of the members of our board of directors are independent under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules and each of the committees of our board of directors is comprised entirely of independent directors. We have continued to refresh our board of directors with the addition of new independent directors in the last several years. We have a robust shareholder engagement program and feedback from our conversations are shared with our full board of directors and relevant committees. We believe the independent members of our board of directors provide effective oversight and represent the interests of our shareholders. The requested change to our capital structure is unnecessary and is not in the best interest of Meta and its shareholders at this time. We believe that our capital structure is in the best interests of Meta and its shareholders and that our current corporate governance structure is sound and effective. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Proposal Seven: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Disclosure of Voting Results Based on Class of Shares The proponents of this resolution are lead filer Treasurer for the State of Illinois and Trustee of the Bright Start College Savings Trust and co-filers Schroder Unit Trusts Limited and Wespath Funds Trust. DISCLOSURE OF VOTING RESULTS BY CLASS OF SHARES RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Meta Platforms, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) disclose the voting results on matters subject to a shareholder vote according to the class of shares, namely differentiating between those shares carrying one voting right and those carrying multiple voting rights, effective beginning at the Company&#8217;s 2026 annual meeting of shareholders. SUPPORTING STATEMENT The Company maintains a dual class structure for its common stock. Its Class A common stock has one vote per share while its Class B common stock has ten votes per share. The Company&#8217;s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, owns nearly 100% of the outstanding Class B stock. His economic interest in the Company is significant (14%) but his ownership of Class B shares grants him a much larger percentage of the voting power (61%). 1 Currently, voting results are disclosed by the Company without any distinction by share class. We believe it is important for those results to be disclosed separately by share class to determine whether the concerns of each class of shareholder are aligned and communicated appropriately to the Board. Based on the voting results from last year&#8217;s annual meeting, a majority of Class A shareholders are estimated to have voted to support approximately half of the ten shareholder proposals on the Company&#8217;s proxy statement. These proposals covered topics including the Company&#8217;s dual-class stock structure, amendments to its corporate governance guidelines, misinformation on the platform, and potential impacts on child well-being. Additionally, one director is estimated to have received less than 50% support among Class A shareholders, while three other directors are estimated to have received less than 60% support. The amendment to the Company&#8217;s 2012 equity incentive plan is also estimated to have received only 11% support. Consequently, none of the shareholder proposals passed, whereas all the management proposals passed. Given that Class B stockholders can disproportionately impact voting decisions that may or may not reflect the proportionate desires of most shareholders, it would benefit these shareholders to clearly see when this has occurred. 1 https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326801/000132680124000057/meta-20240529.htm 2025 Proxy Statement | 75 Table of Contents The disaggregation of voting results by share class would enable Class A shareholders to better monitor how responsive the Company is to issues that most shareholders raise. This enhanced understanding could result in greater shareholder loyalty and thereby build the type of consensus and mutual trust that can prove useful when companies experience periods of below-market performance or significant volatility. The disaggregation of voting results is also a non-onerous practice that the Company could adopt without undue burden, as evidenced by multiple U.S. companies already having adopted this disclosure as a governance best-practice. 2 Additionally, the practice is encouraged by the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit, nonpartisan association of long-term investors with a combined AUM of approximately $5 trillion, by its inclusion in their Corporate Governance Guidelines. 3 For these reasons, we urge you to vote FOR Proposal Seven. META BOARD RESPONSE &#8226; Our existing disclosures around our capital structure and security ownership already provide transparency to the general public and our shareholders. &#8226; Our board of directors remains committed to effective oversight and consideration of shareholder interests, regardless of which class of common stock our shareholders own. &#8226; The requested disclosure is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. Our existing disclosures around our capital structure and security ownership already provide transparency to the general public and our shareholders. We provide existing disclosures around our capital structure and security ownership through our proxy statement and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As we have disclosed, our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. In addition, we also provide disclosure around the security ownership of certain of our beneficial owners and management, including the shares of outstanding Class B common stock and the amount and percentage of Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO. Our shareholders have access to information through our existing disclosure, including our capital structure and characteristics attributed to our Class B common stock, which allow them to make informed assessments of our voting results. Our board of directors remains committed to effective oversight and consideration of shareholder interests, regardless of which class of common stock our shareholders own. Our board of directors, which is composed of a substantial majority of independent directors, remains committed to ensuring that the interests of all shareholders, irrespective of the class of shares held, are adequately protected. We maintain an ongoing shareholder engagement program throughout the year, which includes engagement meetings with Class A shareholders. Feedback from these meetings is shared with our full board of directors and relevant committees. We also disclose information regarding our shareholder engagement efforts and key themes from those discussions with Class A shareholders, as described in this proxy statement. The requested disclosure is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. The requested disclosure is not commonly provided by other companies with multi-class capital structures. Our board of directors believes that disclosing the voting results separately for each class of shares would be unnecessary. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 2 https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001649744/000119312524146033/d736999d8k.htm; https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001050606/000119312523149534/d650502d8k.htm 3 https://www.cii.org/corp_gov_policies 76 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Proposal Eight: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Report on Hate Targeting Marginalized Communities The proponent of this resolution is JLens on behalf of the Leichtag Foundation. Report on Hate Targeting Marginalized Communities RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Meta Platforms, Inc. prepare a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary or privileged information, detailing the company&#8217;s policies, practices, and effectiveness in combating hate on its platform(s) and services, specifically antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-disability hate. The report may evaluate the adequacy of moderation, enforcement, user protection, ad policies, and transparency efforts, with findings made publicly available within one year. Supporting Statement We believe ADL&#8217;s annual survey highlights the need for Meta to address antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-disability hate to foster a safer online environment. 1 Following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, antisemitism surged, and 41% of Jewish adults reported altering their online behavior to avoid being recognized as Jewish. LGBTQ+ individuals were the most harassed group surveyed, with physical threats doubling (6% to 14%) and severe harassment against transgender people rising from 30% to 45%. People with disabilities also faced increased harassment, with 45% reporting general harassment (up from 35%) and 31% experiencing severe harassment (up from 20%). A detailed report on Meta&#8217;s efforts to combat hate would provide shareholders critical insights into corporate policies designed to protect users from harm. Ineffective moderation may drive users to platforms with stronger protections and deter advertisers prioritizing brand safety, reducing engagement and revenue. To secure long-term profitability and user trust in a competitive social media landscape, Meta must prioritize content moderation. At Meta&#8217;s discretion, the report may include, but not limited to, the following areas: &#8226; Expertise: Integration of antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-disability experts to enhance policies and staff training. &#8226; Content Moderation, Advertising and Policies: Alignment with best practices to address hate, including removing terrorist support and harmful conspiracy theories. In 2023, ADL and the Tech Transparency Project found that Facebook and Instagram were recommending antisemitic content, including Nazi propaganda, and continued to host some hate groups that violated policies. 2 &#8226; Enforcement Mechanisms: Evaluate tools for detecting and removing antisemitic content and hate speech. ADL&#8217;s 2024 Center for Tech and Society found Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s reporting mechanisms fundamentally broken, failing to address antisemitic content effectively. In the 2023 CTS Holocaust Denial Report Card, Meta&#8217;s platforms scored a C-, trailing behind competitors like Twitch and YouTube. &#8226; User Support: Enhance resources for users experiencing hate speech. In 2023, Meta platforms scored lower than competitors like Twitch, TikTok, and YouTube in supporting harassment targets. 3 &#8226; Data Transparency: Unlike Reddit and YouTube, Meta&#8217;s reports lack critical context, limiting insights into moderation efforts. Current APIs restrict independent researchers from auditing content like comments and stories, as well as WhatsApp. Privacy protections in the Content Library hinder analysis of public figures&#8217; activities. Meta should offer a comprehensive research API allowing privacy-protected access to random samples of public, private, and moderated content for independent auditing.

Our Community Standards prohibit hateful conduct targeting protected characteristics on our platform. Our Community Standards outline what is and is not allowed on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Threads. These standards are based on feedback from our community and the advice of internal and external experts in fields like technology, public safety, free expression, and human rights. We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don&#8217;t feel attacked on the basis of who they are. That is why our Community Standards prohibit hateful conduct, which we define as direct attacks against people &#8212; rather than concepts or institutions &#8212; on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease. Our Community Standards also prohibit bullying and harassment on our platform, and we remove content that violates our policies and disable the accounts of people who repeatedly break our rules. We have content enforcement systems in place to respond to content that violates our Community Standards. This year, we announced updates to our content enforcement systems, including that we will prioritize enforcement against high severity harms, and rely more on users to report an issue before we take action on other types of content. As outlined in our Community Standards, we continue to prohibit and remove a wide range of attacks based on protected characteristics including dehumanizing speech, calls for harm, harmful stereotypes, slurs, various types of insults, and calls for exclusion. We also continue to review content holistically against all of our Community Standards. We regularly publish a Community Standards Enforcement Report to track our progress, including with respect to hateful conduct, and to demonstrate our continued commitment to making our platforms safe and inclusive. Our board of directors provides oversight of our approach to content governance. The board of directors oversees content governance and integrity primarily through its privacy &amp; product compliance committee. Our management team provides the committee with regular updates on the company&#8217;s product compliance, including in the areas of content governance and integrity. Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal.

Report on Child Safety Impacts and Actual Harm Reduction to Children Social media impacts children&#8217;s brains differently than adult brains. 1 It also poses physical and psychological risks that children and teens are unprepared for, including sextortion, grooming, hate group recruitment, human trafficking, cyberbullying, harassment, invasion of privacy, financial scams, and exposure to sexual, violent or self-harm content, among others. Meta is the world&#8217;s largest social media company with billons of children and teen users. Meta&#8217;s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, have been linked to numerous child safety impacts including: Mental Health: Meta&#8217;s own research shows Instagram&#8217;s negative impacts on teens&#8217; self-image, increased rates of depression and anxiety, and increased suicidal thoughts. 2 Forty-two states sued Meta claiming Facebook and Instagram algorithms are intentionally addictive and harm kids&#8217; mental health. 3 The United States (U.S.) Surgeon General called for social media warning labels due to its impact on kids&#8217; mental health. 4 Sexual Exploitation: In 2023, nearly 36 million cases of online child sexual abuse material were reported; nearly 31 million of those (85 percent) stemmed from Meta platforms. 5 Meta has started encrypting Messenger despite urgent warnings from law enforcement and child protection organizations that encryption will hide millions of reports, cloak the actions of child predators, and make children more vulnerable. 6 Instagram&#8217;s algorithms &#8220;connect and promote&#8221; a vast pedophile network by guiding pedophiles to sellers of child sexual abuse materials. 7 Instagram is ranked first and Facebook second as sources of sextortion, which has also led to teen suicides. 8 Cyberbullying: &#8220;[N]early 80% of teens are on Instagram and more than half of those users have been bullied on the platform.&#8221; 9 A United Kingdom study ranked Instagram first, Facebook second, and WhatsApp fourth in youth cyberbullying. 10 Data Privacy / Age Verification: In 2022, Meta was fined over $400 million for failing to safeguard children&#8217;s information on Instagram. 11 Internal documents show Meta did little about millions of underage users. 12 Legislation: The European Union&#8217;s Digital Services Act requires identifying, reporting and removing child sexual abuse material. 13 The United Kingdom&#8217;s Online Safety bill aims to protect children from online fraud and harmful content. The U.S. proposed Kids Online Safety Act requires companies to prevent or mitigate child risks including suicide, eating disorders and substance abuse.&#8221; 14,15 Meta is facing significant regulatory, reputational, and legal risks due to these unabated issues. 1 https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2022/social-media-children-teens 2 https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739 3 https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/11/03/meta-lawsuit-attorney-generals-pursue-social-mediaaccountability/71410913007/ 4 https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html 5 https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline/cybertiplinedata 6 https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/technology/meta-messenger-encryption.html 7 https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-vast-pedophile-network-4ab7189 8 https://info.thorn.org/hubfs/Research/Thorn_TrendsInFinancialSextortion_June2024.pdf 9 https://time.com/5619999/instagram-mosseri-bullying-artificial-intelligence 10 https://techjury.net/blog/cyberbullying-statistics 11 https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/meta-fined-400m-for-failing-to-protect-childrens-privacy-on-instagram 12 https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/technology/instagram-meta-children-privacy.html 13 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/opinion/social-media-facebook-transparency.html?smid=em-share 14 https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/protecting-kids-online-bipartisan-cause-senators/story?id=97195752 15 https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/kosa-kids-online-safety-act-speech-censor-rcna128249 2025 Proxy Statement | 79 Table of Contents Meta&#8217;s website lists new steps taken to improve child safety, but it has no publicly available, company-wide child safety or harm reduction performance targets for investors and stakeholders to judge the effectiveness of Meta&#8217;s announced tools, policies and actions. Resolved: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors publishes a report (prepared at reasonable expense, excluding proprietary information) that includes targets and quantitative metrics appropriate to assessing whether and how Meta has improved its performance globally regarding child safety impacts and actual harm reduction to children on its platforms. META BOARD RESPONSE &#8226; We are committed to fostering a safe, positive experience online for young people. &#8226; We have made significant changes and investments to help protect young people on our platforms. &#8226; We collaborate with global experts and industry partners to build a broader child protection ecosystem. &#8226; We have robust public disclosure detailing our ongoing child safety efforts, including quantitative metrics on how we took action to enhance child safety. &#8226; The board of directors, primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee, provides oversight over this issue. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders in light of our existing practices, and disclosures regarding child safety. We are committed to fostering a safe, positive experience online for young people. We want all people, especially young people, to connect with others in an environment where they feel safe, and where they leave our technologies feeling good about the time spent on them. To that end, at Meta, fostering safe and positive experiences is always a top priority. For most of our services, our Terms of Service require users to be at least 13 years old. In some countries, our minimum age is higher. With respect to Facebook and Instagram, users are not able to create accounts with a birthdate under 13, and we also implement several methods to detect and remove underage users from those platforms, including human review of accounts with characteristics of underage users, as well as tools for users to report underage accounts. Users who are identified through any of these methods lose access to the app and can appeal this decision through identity verification. We have developed a three-pronged approach to protecting young people online that is tailored to each technology in our family of apps: &#8226; Prevent : we use automated systems and employ review teams to help detect and remove certain harmful content before it reaches a large audience &#8226; Control : we provide users with various settings to control their privacy, who can see their posts, and what kind of content appears on their feeds &#8226; Respond : when issues are detected, we take action to remove violating content, disable accounts, and report apparent instances of child sexual exploitation content that we become aware of to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in line with our legal obligations Our Community Standards state clearly that we prohibit content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children, bullies or harasses children, or encourages suicide, self-injury, or eating disorders. As announced in January 2025, we are adjusting our automated content enforcement systems so that they focus primarily on illegal and high-severity violations, including child sexual exploitation, suicide, and self-harm. We have made significant changes and investments to help protect young people on our platforms. We have developed more than 50 tools, features, and resources across our apps to support teens and their families. When it comes to young people, three core values guide our work: 80 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents &#8226; We believe in helping young people enjoy the benefits of our technologies &#8226; We know younger people require additional safeguards for their safety, privacy, and well-being &#8226; We constantly explore innovative technologies that aim to provide greater experiences for young people safely In September 2024, we introduced Instagram Teen Accounts, which have built-in protections for teens. These accounts limit who can contact teens and the content they see. For example, teens are defaulted into private accounts, which means only people they approve can see and interact with their content, and they are defaulted into the strictest message settings, meaning they can only be messaged by people they are already connected to. Teens under the age of 16 will need a parent&#8217;s permission to change any of these built-in protections to be less strict. With Teen Accounts, teens are also defaulted in the most restrictive setting of our Sensitive Content Control, which reduces the amount of sensitive content even further than the default setting, and we hide much of this sensitive content from teens completely, even if shared in Feed and Stories by someone they follow. Over the past year, we made significant changes to our youth protection tools. For example, we introduced more tools to fight sextortion on our platforms, including notifying teens if someone they are chatting with is in another country - because sextortion scammers often misrepresent where they are to trick young people into trusting them. We started hiding people&#8217;s follower and following lists from potential sextorters - which experts had noted could be used by scammers to blackmail their targets. We announced a new nudity protection feature, which blurs images detected as potentially containing nudity in Instagram DMs, and warns people of the risks associated with sharing sensitive images. This feature will be on by default for teens under 18 globally. We also removed the ability to screenshot images and videos sent as &#8216;view once&#8217; in Instagram DM and Messenger, meaning people do not need to worry about these messages being screenshotted or recorded in-app without their consent. We also will not allow people to open &#8216;view once&#8217; images or videos on Instagram web, to avoid them circumventing this screenshot prevention. Our Family Center offers a suite of supervision tools, including features that allow parents to see who their teen is following and followed by, and who they have been chatting with in the past seven days - both of which give parents the chance to ask their teen about any account they are unsure of. Through supervision, parents can also see how much time their teen is spending on Instagram, set daily time limits and schedule breaks. The Family Center also lets parents manage their teen&#8217;s account across different apps &#8211; Instagram, Facebook, Messenger and Meta Quest - and has an education hub with resources to help parents guide teens&#8217; online experiences. We collaborate with global experts and industry partners to build a broader child protection ecosystem. We recognize that child protection requires a global and comprehensive response. Ongoing action is required from industry, law enforcement, government, civil society and families. Some of the ways that we collaborate with key stakeholders include: &#8226; We use industry-leading tools to fight child sexual exploitation, and report apparent instances of child exploitation that we become aware of to the NCMEC, in line with our legal obligations. &#8226; We supported NCMEC to develop the Take It Down tool, which is designed to give young people back control of their intimate images and helps prevent them being shared online. &#8226; We work with our Safety Advisory Council, comprising leading internet safety organizations from around the world, to develop industry best practices, build and share technology to fight online child exploitation, support victim services and more. &#8226; We are a founding member of Lantern, a program run by the Tech Coalition, which allows participating companies to share signals about violating child safety accounts and behaviors, so other companies can investigate and take action on their platforms too. Meta provides the underlying technical infrastructure and expanded the program&#8217;s sextortion-specific signals, in addition to signals about other violating child safety behaviors. Predators do not limit themselves to any one platform, so it is important we work together to take action across the different services they use. &#8226; This past year, we joined Thorn, All Tech is Human and other leading tech companies in an effort to prevent the misuse of generative AI tools to perpetrate child exploitation. Alongside our industry partners, we committed to Safety by Design principles to be applied as appropriate and to provide updates on our progress. Instagram also launched a new awareness-raising campaign, informed by NCMEC and Thorn, to help teens spot sextortion scams and help parents support their teens in avoiding these scams. As part of the campaign, we showed an educational video directly in the Instagram Feed of millions of teens and young adults in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia &#8211; countries commonly targeted by sextortion scammers. Instagram also partnered with popular creators to help raise awareness of these scams while assuring teens that sextortion is never their fault and that there is help available. Building on this education campaign, Meta recently announced a new partnership with US NGO Childhelp, to launch a first-of-its-kind education campaign, designed to teach middle schoolers about how to stay safe online, including how to recognize grooming, sextortion scams, and other types of online exploitation, and what to do if they or someone they know needs help. 2025 Proxy Statement | 81 Table of Contents We have robust public disclosure detailing our ongoing child safety efforts, including quantitative metrics on how we took action to enhance child safety. We continue to enhance our disclosure for all stakeholders, as we strive to be open and proactive in how we safeguard all of our users&#8217; privacy, security, and access to information online. Our child safety policies are defined in our Community Standards, including our policies on child sexual exploitation, abuse, and nudity, how we help teens see age-appropriate content, and other policies regarding additional protection for minors. In our Community Standards Enforcement Reports, we have highlighted actions that we have taken against content that violates our rules, including information on the content we have removed for violating our child sexual exploitation, abuse, and nudity policies. For example, between October and December 2024, we took action on 6.2 million pieces of child sexual exploitation content on Facebook, of which 95.3% was found and actioned by us before it was reported, while 4.7% was reported by users. Over the same time period, we took action on 2 million pieces of child sexual exploitation content on Instagram, of which 96.9% was found and actioned by us before it was reported, while 3.1% was reported by users. In addition to disclosing quantitative metrics on our actions in the Community Standards Enforcement Reports and Responsible Business Practices Reports, we utilize this data to deploy tools and launch new programs targeted at reducing the sharing of this content. We also provide transparency into our efforts to find and report child exploitation to the NCMEC, above and beyond NCMEC&#8217;s own annual cybertip report. We disclose the number of CyberTips reported to NCMEC from Facebook and Instagram each quarter, including additional data that demonstrates the types of reports we are making to NCMEC. The board of directors, primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee, provides oversight over this issue. Our board&#8217;s privacy &amp; product compliance committee has principal responsibility to assist the board with respect to the company&#8217;s product compliance, including in the areas of content governance and integrity, youth and well-being, and artificial intelligence development and implementation. The committee is actively engaged on issues concerning safety on our platform, particularly as it relates to young people, and receives regular reporting on the steps management has taken to assist in overseeing risks associated with these topics. Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders in light of our existing practices and disclosures regarding child safety. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Proposal Ten: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Report on Risks of Deepfakes in Online Child Exploitation The proponent of this resolution is lead filer Bowyer Research, Inc. on behalf of a shareholder who wishes to remain anonymous. Report on Risks of Deepfakes in Online Child Exploitation Meta is one of the largest social media companies in the world, with more than 3 billion users active across its various platforms. As such, Meta has both an interest in, and responsibility to, address the growing risks created by its ongoing innovation in artificial intelligence. While artificial intelligence has many benefits and advantages, it also presents unique challenges that the company ought to address to avoid complicity in online victimization of children. Earlier this year, Meta made the decision to add &#8220;Made with AI&#8221; labels to political content that involved use of AI. This decision is laudable. Yet, if Meta is willing to take tangible steps to curb broad social harms in the political arena, it should also be willing to take similar steps to curb the even more widespread social harm of online child abuse &#8212; harm that Meta&#8217;s platforms, unfortunately, have become a breeding ground for. As per a report 1 released in June 2024 from Thorn and the NCMEC, Instagram and Facebook were the top two sites named in threats of sextortion, with Instagram being the top site where sextortion materials were actually distributed. With the meteoric rise in use of deepfake materials comes an increasing likelihood that the child exploitation risk that follows will see a similar spike. 1 https://info.thorn.org/hubfs/Research/Thorn_TrendsInFinancialSextortion_June2024.pdf 82 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents These are serious risks &#8212; and Meta has, in other areas, taken similar risks of child exploitation seriously. As per NCOSE 2 , Meta has made recent updates to its policies that further privatize child accounts and limit their exposure to explicit content. It&#8217;s time to extend that same scrutiny, if not more, to the potential for child abuse that deepfake media creates. The new age of artificial intelligence carries with it new opportunities to deter predation, limit the spread of child sex abuse material (CSAM), and protect the most innocent among us. Failure to do so, as evidenced by massive recent class-action lawsuits 3 against tech companies like Apple, carries not only moral risks but tremendous legal and reputational price tags. Responding to that new age means taking on the challenge of combating child sex abuse with the kind of serious strategies and innovative thinking that Meta is known for worldwide &#8212; and helping to create a world 4 where &#8220;enabling the best of what people can do together&#8221; involves protecting innocents from the worst that the online world has to offer. Resolved : Shareholders request that Meta prepare a transparency report on the company&#8217;s use of deepfake identifying software to combat the risks of online child exploitation. This report shall be made publicly available to the company&#8217;s shareholders on the company&#8217;s website, be prepared at a reasonable cost, and omit proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. META BOARD RESPONSE &#8226; Meta&#8217;s Community Standards clearly prohibit content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children, including deepfakes. &#8226; Meta has invested in enhanced child safety tools and works closely with internal and external stakeholders to fight child sexual exploitation and improve policies and enforcement around online safety issues. &#8226; In April 2024, we signed on to principles set by Thorn and All Tech is Human, along with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI and others, to address issues around AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). &#8226; We report on actions we take against child sexual exploitation, abuse, and nudity in our Transparency Center. &#8226; The board of directors provides oversight over our efforts in this area primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee. &#8226; Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to shareholders in light of our existing practices, and disclosures regarding child safety. Meta&#8217;s Community Standards clearly prohibit content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children, including deepfakes. Meta&#8217;s policy is clear that we do not allow content, activity, or interactions that threaten, depict, praise, support, provide instructions for, make statements of intent, admit participation in, or share links of the sexual exploitation of children - whether real or AI-generated. Meta has invested in enhanced child safety tools and works closely with internal and external stakeholders to fight child sexual exploitation and improve policies and enforcement around online safety issues. At Meta, we know that one of our most important responsibilities is to help keep young people safe online. We take a three-pronged approach to child protection - prevent, control and respond &#8211; that is tailored to each technology in our family of apps: &#8226; Prevent : we use automated systems and employ review teams to help detect and remove certain harmful content before it reaches a large audience &#8226; Control : we provide users with various settings to control their privacy, who can see their posts, and what kind of content appears on their feeds &#8226; Respond : when issues are detected, we take action to remove violating content, disable accounts, and report apparent instances of child sexual exploitation content that we become aware of to the NCMEC in line with our legal obligations 2 https://endsexualexploitation.org/meta/ 3 https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/08/technology/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-lawsuit.html 4 https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Facebooks-Corporate-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf 2025 Proxy Statement | 83 Table of Contents Our policies prohibit CSAM and other forms of child sexual exploitation, regardless of whether that material reflects content generated by individuals or through artificial intelligence, including &#8220;deepfakes.&#8221; For example, we use image matching tools to scan for potential CSAM, including AI-generated CSAM. We supported NCMEC to develop the Take It Down tool. The Take It Down tool assigns a unique digital fingerprint, called a hash, to nude, partially nude or sexually explicit images or videos - whether real or AI-generated - of people under the age of 18. Participating companies can use these hashes to help prevent copies of these images being shared on their respective platforms. We also have made significant advancements in the use of technology to respond to a variety of harms, including the posting of child nudity, unwanted interactions between adults and teens, and inappropriate interactions with children. As announced in January 2025, we are adjusting our automated content enforcement systems so that they focus primarily on illegal and high-severity violations, including child sexual exploitation, suicide, and self-harm. We recognize that child protection requires a global and comprehensive response. Ongoing action is required from industry, law enforcement, government, civil society and families. Some of the ways that we collaborate with key stakeholders include: &#8226; Using industry-leading tools to fight child sexual exploitation, and reporting apparent instances of child exploitation, including when AI-generated, that we become aware of to NCMEC, in line with our legal obligations. &#8226; Working with leading internet safety organizations from around the world to develop industry best practices, build and share technology to fight online child exploitation, support victim services and more. &#8226; Participating in efforts like Lantern, a program run by the Tech Coalition, that allows tech companies to share signals of violating child safety accounts and behavior, so they can investigate and take action on their platforms too.

This past year, we joined Thorn, All Tech is Human and other leading tech companies in an effort to prevent the misuse of generative AI tools to perpetrate child exploitation. Alongside our industry partners, we committed to Safety by Design principles to be applied as appropriate and to provide updates on our progress. These principles, which will inform how we develop generative AI technology at Meta to help mitigate potential risks from the start, include: &#8226; Developing, building and training generative AI models that proactively address child safety risks, including responsibly sourcing our training data sets and safeguarding them from CSAM and CSEM, incorporating feedback loops and stress-testing strategies in our development process and employing content provenance with adversarial misuse in mind &#8226; Releasing and distributing generative AI models after they have been trained and evaluated for child safety, providing protections throughout the process, including safeguarding our generative AI products and services from abusive content and conduct, responsibly hosting models and encouraging developer ownership in safety by design &#8226; Maintaining model and platform safety by continuing to actively understand and respond to child safety risks, including working to prevent our services from scaling access to harmful tools, investing in research and future technology solutions and fighting CSAM and CSEM, including AI-generated CSAM and CSEM, on our platforms We report on actions we take against child sexual exploitation, abuse, and nudity in our Transparency Center. We strive to be open and proactive in the way we safeguard users&#8217; privacy, security and access to information online. Our Community Standards Enforcement Report includes: &#8226; Actions we have taken against content that violates our rules &#8226; Information on the amount of content we have removed for violating our child sexual exploitation, abuse and nudity policies, which includes removal of AI deepfakes &#8226; Related trends we have observed These reports are inclusive of actions taken to remove all detected CSEM and CSAM materials, including AI deepfakes. The board of directors provides oversight over our efforts in this area primarily through the privacy &amp; product compliance committee. Our board&#8217;s privacy &amp; product compliance committee has principal responsibility to assist the board with respect to the company&#8217;s product compliance, including in the areas of content governance and integrity, youth and well-being, and artificial intelligence development and implementation.

The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Proposal Eleven: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Report on AI Data Usage Oversight The proponent of this resolution is the National Legal and Policy Center. Report on AI Data Usage Oversight Whereas: The immense and transformative potential of artificial intelligence comes with substantial risks. The development and training of AI systems rely on vast amounts of data, and public information available via the Internet may not be enough to quench developers&#8217; insatiable thirst for high-quality training data. 1 Thus, stakeholders are concerned that developers will draw from sources in an unethical or illegal manner. 2,3,4 Supporting Statement: Meta Platforms, Inc. (&#8220;Meta&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an early leader in the AI arms race, 5 which has helped push the Company to one of the highest market capitalizations in the world. 6 Meta has successfully integrated AI into its advertising business 7 and social media products. 8 These features grow user engagement and increase advertising efficiency, further expanding Meta&#8217;s data dominance. Unlike its large-scale competitors, Meta&#8217;s primary AI models are open source. 9 Rather than monetize its AI models itself, Meta&#8217;s strategy is to use its AI models to further monetize its data empire&#8212;which includes &#8220;hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the Common Crawl dataset.&#8221; 10 Given Meta&#8217;s history of privacy violations and unethical data practices, shareholders and consumers should be concerned that Meta&#8217;s data-driven AI strategy will create new opportunities for misconduct. Past abuses include: &#8226; Meta&#8217;s updated privacy policy now allows them to use a wide range of personal data for developing and improving its AI technologies, without explicit user consent 11 &#8226; Meta has been subject to a record &#8364;1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) fine for breaching the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation 12,13 &#8226; A coalition of European consumer rights groups have accused Meta of collecting &#8220;an unnecessary amount of information on its users &#8212; such as data used to infer their sexual orientation, emotional state or even their susceptibility to addiction &#8212; which they are unable to freely consent to.&#8221; 14 1 https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-training-data-synthetic-openai-anthropic-9230f8d8 2 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-personal-information-is-probably-being-used-to-train-generativeai-models/ 3 https://www.axios.com/2024/01/02/copyright-law-violation-artificial-intelligence-courts 4 https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/risks-unleashing-generative-ai-company-data-2023-12-22/ 5 https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html 6 https://companiesmarketcap.com/meta-platforms/marketcap/ 7 https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html 8 https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/02/5-amazing-ways-how-meta-facebook-is-using-generative-ai/ 9 https://www.llama.com/ 10 https://venturebeat.com/ai/inside-metas-ai-strategy-zuckerberg-stresses-compute-open-source-and-training-data/ 11 https://katefitzgeraldconsulting.com/2024/05/31/your-privacy-rights-understanding-the-recent-changes-to-metas-privacy-policy/ 12 https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/business/meta-facebook-eu-privacy-fine.html 13 https://tech.co/news/meta-fined-100k-a-day 14 https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/tech/meta-data-processing-europe-gdpr/index.html 2025 Proxy Statement | 85 Table of Contents These are just a few examples in Meta&#8217;s long history of misconduct. 15,16,17 Prioritizing data ethics in Meta&#8217;s AI development will help avoid harmful fiduciary and regulatory 18,19 consequences. 20 Developers who prioritize ethical data usage will reap the benefits of consumer trust, 21 while those that do not will suffer.

Proposal Twelve: Shareholder Proposal Regarding GHG Emissions Reduction Actions The proponent of this resolution is As You Sow on behalf of Myra K. Young and James McRitchie. WHEREAS: Meta, a global leader in social technology, is rapidly growing its data center footprint to support expanded artificial intelligence operations. This expansion has caused Meta&#8217;s electricity use to increase by 200% and its total greenhouse gas emissions to double since 2019. 1 To maintain its carbon neutrality claims, Meta purchases renewable energy certificates (RECs). However, RECs are an insufficient decarbonization tool as they do not generally result in new renewable energy capacity, leaving Meta&#8217;s data centers reliant on high-carbon energy. This reliance exposes Meta to risks including accusations of greenwashing, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and potential restrictions on its license to operate in certain localities. 2 While Meta is building some renewable capacity through Power Purchase Agreements, its growing energy consumption is outpacing these efforts, leaving the Company dependent on fossil fuel-generated power. Meta&#8217;s plan to &#8220;offset&#8221; its high-carbon energy use by purchasing RECs is problematic, as they simply reallocate existing clean energy from the grid without adding new renewable capacity and without achieving meaningful emissions reductions. 3 1 https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Meta-2024-Sustainability-Report.pdf Index C; https://sustainability.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Meta-2024-Sustainability-Report.pdf Index G 2 https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/05/data-center-protest-community-resistance/; https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-denied-data-center-planning-permission-in-dublin-ireland/ 3 https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/21/renewable-energy-credits-certificates-greenwashing/ 2025 Proxy Statement | 87 Table of Contents In Louisiana, where Meta&#8217;s record-breaking data center is to be built, local utility Entergy plans to build three methane gas-powered combustion turbines to meet demand. 4 While Meta states it will purchase RECs and fund a solar project to offset the new fossil fuels being brought online, it has not provided a timeline, raising concerns about prolonged fossil fuel use to power the data center. Similarly, in Nebraska, Meta&#8217;s energy demands have delayed the retirement of a coal plant, a decision that will increase emissions and leave residents exposed to continuing health risks. 5 These examples illustrate investor concern that Meta lacks a plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels for its data centers. In contrast, Meta&#8217;s peer Alphabet has committed to 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where it operates. 6 This action will result in more carbon-free energy on the electrical grid and an overall decrease in emissions. Investors continue to be concerned about increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to risks outlined above, Meta faces significant physical risks from climate change. Heatwaves and water shortages have already led to significant power outages for competitors. 7 By prioritizing energy procurement strategies that result in new renewable capacity, Meta will be playing a critical role in reducing systemic risks of climate change and avoiding operational disruptions. Therefore, by adopting an energy procurement strategy that results in actual emission reductions, Meta can reduce climate-related risks and ensure that the Company is actively contributing to the decarbonization trajectory of the regions in which it operates. Resolved : Shareholders request that Meta disclose a transition plan that results in new renewable energy capacity, or other actions that achieve actual emissions reductions at least equivalent to the energy demand associated with its expanded data center operations. META BOARD RESPONSE &#8226; We have matched our operational electricity consumption with 100% clean and renewable energy since 2020. &#8226; We design and operate some of the most sustainable data centers in the industry, and promote data center sustainability by prioritizing energy efficiency and clean and renewable energy. &#8226; We continue to prioritize matching our electricity use with 100% renewable energy by adding new projects to local grids. &#8226; Our board&#8217;s audit &amp; risk oversight committee receives updates on our environmental and sustainability strategy. &#8226; Given our existing efforts, the board of directors believes that the additional request is unnecessary. We have matched our operational electricity consumption with 100% clean and renewable energy since 2020. Meta is focused on doing its part in supporting energy efficient operations. As of 2020, our global operations reached net zero emissions and we matched 100% of our electricity use with clean and renewable energy. We have continued to match our electricity consumption with 100% new clean and renewable energy projects for the last four years at a pace consistent with our load growth. Over the last decade, we have contracted for over 15 GW of new clean and renewable energy across the globe. We design and operate some of the most sustainable data centers in the industry, and promote data center sustainability by prioritizing energy efficiency and clean and renewable energy. Our data center design and operation integrate energy efficiency and sustainability considerations, with all data centers achieving gold LEED standards since 2009. LEED provides a framework for healthy, efficient, and cost-saving green buildings, with a key aspect of the LEED rating system being its emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable energy. These efforts help power the technology that billions of people use every day to connect and build community. 4 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/metas-planned-louisiana-data-center-fuels-pollution-worries 5 https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/08/google-meta-omaha-data-centers/ 6 https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/ 7 https://www.wired.com/story/data-centers-climate-change/?utm 88 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents We continue to prioritize matching our electricity use with 100% renewable energy by adding new projects to local grids. As we continue to innovate and grow, we are planning for our data center energy needs while simultaneously contributing to a reliable grid. Building on our efforts to bring new clean and renewable energy to the grid &#8212; including solar, wind, battery storage, and, most recently, geothermal and nuclear power &#8212; we continue to look for innovative ways to enable additional clean and efficient energy resources. Our efforts do not simply involve purchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset emissions. Rather, a fundamental tenet of our approach to clean and renewable energy is the concept of additionality &#8211; partnering with utilities and renewable energy developers to add new projects to the grid. We have long-standing experience bringing new renewable energy to the grid and supporting projects that would otherwise not have been built. Our role in the enablement of these projects is offtaker &#8211; when developers construct and operate new projects, we purchase the renewable energy that is produced. We also prioritize contracting with clean and renewable energy projects that deliver the greatest possible decarbonization benefits to the grid in line with our work as part of the Emissions First Partnership. We have contracted for over 15 GW of new clean and renewable energy across the globe over the last decade. In alignment with many other companies that have similar goals, we receive RECs from the new renewable projects we enable. RECs are essential tracking mechanisms that allow us to maintain a ledger of what clean energy was produced each year from the projects we support. We also consult with third party auditors who review and confirm that our energy accounting is accurate. In many states where we buy renewable energy, we are not the only buyers of RECs &#8211; utilities, other companies and public entities like cities and school districts also utilize RECs to track the delivery of clean electricity. In some markets, clean energy procurement is limited, but we strive to support quality, long-term projects and less than 5% of our reported 2023 renewable energy purchases were from short-term unbundled RECs purchases. Our board&#8217;s audit &amp; risk oversight committee receives updates on our environmental and sustainability strategy. Our board&#8217;s audit &amp; risk oversight committee receives regular updates on key sustainability priorities as well as the overall net zero and sustainability program strategy, which includes our energy efficiency and renewable energy work. The committee has the opportunity to engage with management on the programs and policies supporting the company&#8217;s strategy, as well as transition risks, including steps taken to monitor and mitigate exposures. Given our existing efforts, the board of directors believes that the additional request is unnecessary. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Proposal Thirteen: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Bitcoin Treasury Assessment The proponent of this resolution is Ethan Peck on behalf of IP 2006 GRAT Robert Peck Descendants Trust. Bitcoin Treasury Assessment Supporting Statement: As of September 30, 2024, Meta has $256 billion in total assets, $72 billion of which is cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including US government bonds and corporate bonds. 1 Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 2 28% of Meta&#8217;s total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value simply by sitting on the balance sheet. Meta should&#8212;and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to&#8212;consider replacing some, or some percentage, of those assets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term. 1 https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/1 edgar/data/1326801/000132680124000081/meta-20240930.htm 2 https://ycharts.com/indicators/5_year_treasury_rate; https://ycharts.com/indicators/10_year_treasury_rate; https://ycharts.com/indicators/moodys_seasoned_aaa_corporate_bond_yield; https://www.marketwatch.com/story/true-inflation-may-have-peaked-in-late-2022-at-18-and-still-hovers-around-8-cc89ea6b 2025 Proxy Statement | 89 Table of Contents Due to its verifiable fixed supply, Bitcoin is the most inflation-resistant store of value available. This is especially true compared to other liquid assets. As of December 20, 2024, the price of Bitcoin increased by 124% over the previous year, 3 outperforming bonds by roughly 119% on average. 4 Over the past five years, the price of Bitcoin increased by 1,265%, 5 outperforming bonds by roughly 1,262% on average. 6 Meta founder, CEO and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg named his goats &#8220;Bitcoin&#8221; and &#8220;Max.&#8221; 7 Meta director Marc Andreessen has praised Bitcoin 8 and is also a director at Coinbase. Do Meta shareholders not deserve the same kind of responsible asset allocation for the Company that Meta directors and executives likely implement for themselves? Meta&#8217;s second largest institutional shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. 9 The reasoning behind that allocation holds true for Meta&#8217;s assets as well. Corporate and institutional Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace and proving to be an effective strategy. For example, MicroStrategy stock has outperformed Meta stock by 2,191% over the past five years; 10 more public companies are adding Bitcoin to their treasuries every week; 11 BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF is the fastest growing ETF in history; 12 and the US federal government and some state governments may form Bitcoin strategic reserves in 2025. 13 Meta has always been a forward thinking, innovative company&#8212;not a company that follows technological trends, but one that sets them. The Company has an opportunity to honor that tradition by being a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption and corporate treasury management apt for the 21st century. At minimum, Meta should evaluate the benefits of exchanging some&#8212;even just a few percent&#8212;of its cash and bonds for Bitcoin. RESOLVED : Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company&#8217;s treasury is in the best interests of shareholders. META BOARD RESPONSE &#8226; Meta utilizes a thorough decision-making process that considers many types of investable assets. &#8226; This requested assessment is unnecessary given Meta&#8217;s existing processes to manage its corporate treasury. Meta utilizes a thorough decision-making process that considers many types of investable assets. Our audit &amp; risk oversight committee provides oversight over Meta&#8217;s treasury policies, and our primary goals are to preserve capital and provide liquidity to the company. To support our ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditure needs, management comprehensively reviews a wide and diverse range of investable assets, including those that offer diversification and risk mitigation, on an ongoing basis. As part of this process, we assess the volatility of potential assets and seek to invest in those which provide a balanced mix of stability and long-term return to support our financial sustainability. 3 https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD?window=1Y 4 https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coporate_aaa_effective_yield; https://ycharts.com/indicators/moodys_seasoned_aaa_corporate_bond_yield; https://ycharts.com/indicators/1_year_treasury_rate 5 https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD?window=5Y 6 https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coporate_aaa_effective_yield; https://ycharts.com/indicators/moodys_seasoned_aaa_corporate_bond_yield; https://ycharts.com/indicators/5_year_treasury_rate 7 https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112954515429031 8 https://youtu.be/c3pX1R7Fwwc?feature=shared&amp;t=1040; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cfJxPXhvVA 9 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-12/blackrock-says-up-to-2-bitcoin-allocation-is-reasonable-range 10 https://www.google.com/finance/quote/MSTR:NASDAQ?window=5Y; https://www.google.com/finance/quote/META:NASDAQ?window=5Y 11 https://bitcointreasuries.net/ 12 https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1864654448858935524 13 https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/3237933/lummis-renewed-push-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-proposes-strategic-bitcoin-fight-200000765.html; https://cointelegraph.com/news/ohio-house-rep-introduces-bitcoin-reserve-bill 90 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury. This requested assessment is unnecessary given Meta&#8217;s existing processes to manage its corporate treasury. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Proposal Fourteen: Shareholder Proposal Regarding Report on Data Collection and Advertising Practices The proponent of this resolution is Tulipshare Capital LLC on behalf of Tulipshare Fund 1 LP. Whereas: Meta has improved transparency and user control regarding data collection and targeted advertising practices&#8212;however reputational, financial, and legal risks persist as regulators and investors scrutinize Meta&#8217;s practices, urging for more robust measures to protect user privacy and comprehensive disclosure of data collection/retention. A recent study analyzing privacy policies of over 5,000 apps determined &#8220;Meta&#8217;s apps take the lion&#8217;s share of data privacy intrusion.&#8221; 1 Instagram and Facebook tied for first place as &#8220;most invasive&#8221; (with Meta Business Suite and Messenger tying for third place) due to the apps&#8217; collection of 32 types of user data, including sensitive information with a significant portion of the data being tracked and linked to individual users (surprisingly, TikTok ranked much lower at 76th). 2 Meta incurs substantial harm due to privacy violations, impacting financial performance and signaling potential future liabilities. Meta was fined by US and UK regulators and recently agreed to a $31.85 million settlement with Australian regulators over the Cambridge Analytica scandal; 3 investors sued Meta for SEC filings treating the risk of unauthorized use of user data as a hypothetical when Meta already knew Cambridge Analytica accessed information on 30 million users, causing stock price and market capitalization to plunge by $100 billion 4 (a multibillion-dollar lawsuit currently alleges Meta misled shareholders about the data-harvesting scandal); 5 Meta was fined &#8364;1.2 billion for breaching the General Data Protection Regulation by illegally transferring EU users&#8217; data; 6 and Meta Pixel has opened avenues for privacy and healthcare litigation. 7 Meta&#8217;s Privacy Policy does not fully detail the extent/specifics concerning the exact nature/granularity of data collected across all platforms, particularly concerning user interactions, device information, geolocation, biometric data, identified and deidentified data (including photos, videos, audio), offline conversions, and off-platform activities. Meta states: &#8220;we process information about you, including Personal Information, whether or not you have an account or are logged in,&#8221; 8 and collects &#8220;[s]ome location-related information, even if Location Services is turned off.&#8221; 9 Meta retains data to &#8220;provide services,&#8221; without specific timeframes/criteria for data retention/deletion, and policies regarding data anonymization/deidentification are not clearly outlined. Though Meta states it obtains user consent for data collection and processing, specific methods by which consent is obtained, how users are informed about data practices, options for users to manage/withdraw consent, cross-platform data integration, and how artificial intelligence/algorithms process user data to create targeted advertisements (including criteria/data used) are not thoroughly detailed&#8212;raising concerns about the adequacy of informed consent and the ability to opt-out of specific data collection practices. RESOLVED : Shareholders request that the Board publish a publicly accessible report&#8212;prepared at reasonable expense, excluding proprietary information&#8212;providing tangible, comprehensive transparency regarding Meta&#8217;s data collection and advertising practices, with a specific focus on improving disclosure of the following issues: 1.

We most recently published our annual Privacy Progress Update in January 2025. This report details how we address privacy risks, privacy product outcomes, technical privacy investments, and our ongoing commitment to privacy. We remain committed to transparency on these topics as we continue to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. Given our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders. The board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the shareholder proposal. Questions and Answers About the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting 1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What are proxy materials? The accompanying proxy is delivered and solicited on behalf of the board of directors of Meta Platforms, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in connection with the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (Annual Meeting) to be held on May&#160;28, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, via live audio webcast in a virtual meeting format at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/META2025 . As a shareholder, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are requested to vote on the items of business described in this proxy statement. This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and is designed to assist you in voting your shares. The proxy materials include this proxy statement for the Annual Meeting, an annual report to shareholders, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Annual Report), and the proxy card or a voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting (Proxy Materials). 2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? In accordance with the SEC rules, we may furnish proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our Annual Report, to our shareholders by providing access to such documents on the internet instead of mailing printed copies. Accordingly, we are sending the Notice to our shareholders of record and beneficial shareholders as of&#160;April&#160;1, 2025, which is the record date for the Annual Meeting. 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How can I access the proxy materials over the internet? The Notice and proxy card or voting instruction form included with the Proxy Materials will contain instructions on how to view the proxy materials on the internet. Electronic copies of this proxy statement and the Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com . 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How can I sign up for the electronic proxy delivery service? The Notice and proxy card or voting instruction form included with the Proxy Materials will contain instructions on how to request electronic delivery of future proxy materials. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email will eliminate the cost of printing and mailing documents and will reduce the associated environmental impact. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it. 5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I share an address with another shareholder. Why did we receive only one copy of the Proxy Materials and how may I obtain an additional copy of the Proxy Materials? The SEC permits companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for the Proxy Materials or other annual meeting materials with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of Proxy Materials or other annual meeting materials addressed to those shareholders unless contrary instructions have been 2025 Proxy Statement | 93 Table of Contents received from the affected shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," is intended to provide extra convenience for shareholders and reduce costs. We and a number of brokers with account holders who are our shareholders will be householding our Proxy Materials. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate proxy cards. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate set of Proxy Materials, or if you are receiving multiple sets of Proxy Materials and would like to receive only one, please notify your broker, bank or other nominee if you are a beneficial shareholder or notify us if you are a registered shareholder. Registered shareholders can notify us by sending a written request to Meta Platforms, Inc., c/o Broadridge Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, or by calling 1-866-540-7095, and we will promptly deliver any additional Proxy Materials requested. 6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What items of business will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? How does the board of directors recommend I vote on these proposals? The following table presents the items of business scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting and the voting recommendation of the board of directors with respect to each proposal: Proposal Board Voting Recommendation Management Proposals: 1.

Other than the proposals described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. 7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? Only holders of record of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April&#160;1, 2025, which is the record date, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on April&#160;1, 2025, we had 2,181,270,402 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 343,179,151 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held as of the above record date. Holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes for each share held as of the above record date. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters described in this proxy statement. A quorum is required for our shareholders to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. A quorum exists if shareholders holding at least a majority of the voting power of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are present at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy. 94 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Registered Shareholders . If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (Computershare), you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Proxy Materials were provided to you directly by us. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the individuals listed on the proxy card or to vote at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Shareholders . If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and the Proxy Materials were forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, who is considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Beneficial owners are also invited to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting. 8.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What votes are required to approve each of the proposals? For Proposal One, directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, which means that the fifteen nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. You may withhold on voting for directors. A withhold vote has no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Approval of Proposal Two, Proposal Three, and Proposal Six through Fourteen requires the affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the votes of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) properly cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" each such proposal. In the event of a negative vote on Proposal Two, our audit &amp; risk oversight committee will reconsider the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. Proposal Four, the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement, will be determined by the affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the votes of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) properly cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" the proposal. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. However, our board of directors and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. Proposal Five, the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency with which we will conduct a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers, will be determined by the affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the votes of the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (voting together as a single class) properly cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" the proposal, and if no choice receives a majority, the choice that receives the plurality of votes cast will be determined to be the preferred frequency. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. However, our board of directors and compensation, nominating &amp; governance committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions regarding the frequency of future votes on the compensation program for our named executive officers. 9.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How are broker non-votes and abstentions counted? A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and has not received voting instructions from its clients. If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will only have discretion to vote your shares on "routine" matters. Where a proposal is not "routine," a broker who has not received instructions from its clients does not have discretion to vote its clients' uninstructed shares on that proposal. At our Annual Meeting, only the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal Two) is considered a routine matter. All other proposals are considered "non-routine," and your broker will not have discretion to vote on these proposals. Broker non-votes and abstentions by shareholders from voting (including brokers holding their clients' shares of record who cause abstentions to be recorded) will be counted towards determining whether or not a quorum is present. However, because broker non-votes and abstentions are not votes cast affirmatively or negatively, they will have no effect on the approval of any of the proposals. 10.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why are we holding a virtual Annual Meeting? We are leveraging technology to hold a virtual Annual Meeting that expands convenient access to, and enables participation by, shareholders from any location around the world. We believe the virtual format encourages attendance and participation by a broader group of shareholders, while also reducing the costs and environmental impact associated with an in-person meeting. The virtual Annual Meeting will allow our shareholders to ask questions and to vote. 2025 Proxy Statement | 95 Table of Contents 11.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How can I attend and participate in the Annual Meeting?

Submitting a telephonic or internet proxy will not affect your right to vote electronically at the Annual Meeting should you decide to attend the Annual Meeting. The telephone and internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to give their voting instructions, and to confirm that shareholders' instructions have been recorded properly. The accompanying proxy card provides instructions on how to vote via the internet or by telephone. 15.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How will my proxy be voted?

The Committee may grant Options to eligible Employees, Consultants, and Non-Employee Directors and will determine whether such Options will be Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of the Code (&#8220; ISOs &#8221;) or Nonqualified Stock Options (&#8220; NQSOs &#8221;), the number of Shares subject to the Option, the Exercise Price of the Option, the period during which the Option may vest and be exercised, and all other terms and conditions of the Option, subject to the following: 5.1 Option Grant . Each Option granted under this Plan will identify the Option as an ISO or an NQSO. An Option may be, but need not be, awarded upon satisfaction of such Performance Factors during any Performance Period as are set out in advance in the Participant&#8217;s individual Award Agreement. 5.2 Date of Grant . The date of grant of an Option will be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant such Option, or a specified future date.

The Committee also may provide for Options to become exercisable at one time or from time to time, periodically or otherwise, in such number of Shares or percentage of Shares as the Committee determines. 5.4 Exercise Price . The Exercise Price of an Option will be determined by the Committee when the Option is granted; provided that: (i) except in the case of Substitute Awards, the Exercise Price of an Option will be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant and (ii) the Exercise Price of any ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant.

Any Option granted hereunder will be vested and exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) notice of exercise (in such form as the Committee may specify from time to time) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with applicable withholding taxes). Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Committee and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan.

The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 2.6 of the Plan. Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised. 5.6 Termination . The exercise of an Option will be subject to the following (except as may be otherwise provided in an Award Agreement): (a) If the Participant is Terminated for any reason except for Cause or the Participant&#8217;s death or Disability, then the Participant may exercise such Participant&#8217;s Options only to the extent that such Options would have been exercisable by the Participant on the Termination Date no later than ninety (90) days after the Termination Date (or such shorter time period or longer time period not exceeding five (5) years as may be determined by the Committee, with any exercise beyond three (3) months after the Termination Date deemed to be the exercise of an NQSO), but in any event no later than the expiration date of the Options. (b) If the Participant is Terminated because of the Participant&#8217;s death (or the Participant dies within ninety (90) days after a Termination other than for Cause or because of the Participant&#8217;s Disability), then the Participant&#8217;s Options may be exercised only to the extent that such Options would have been exercisable by the Participant on the Termination Date and must be exercised by the Participant&#8217;s legal representative, or authorized assignee, no later than twelve (12) months after the Termination Date (or such shorter time period not less than six (6) months or longer time period not exceeding five (5) years as may be determined by the Committee), but in any event no later than the expiration date of the Options. (c) If the Participant is Terminated because of the Participant&#8217;s Disability, then the Participant&#8217;s Options may be exercised only to the extent that such Options would have been exercisable by the Participant on the Termination Date and must be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant&#8217;s legal representative or authorized assignee) no later than six (6) months after the Termination Date (with any exercise beyond (a) three (3) months after the Termination Date when the Termination is for a Disability that is not a &#8220;permanent and total disability&#8221; as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, or (b) twelve (12) months after the Termination Date when the Termination is for a Disability that is a &#8220;permanent and total disability&#8221; as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, deemed to be exercise of an NQSO), but in any event no later than the expiration date of the Options. (d) If the Participant is terminated for Cause, then Participant&#8217;s Options shall expire on such Participant&#8217;s Termination Date, or at such later time and on such conditions as are determined by the Committee, but in any no event later than the expiration date of the Options. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, Cause will have the meaning set forth in the Plan. 5.7 Limitations on Exercise . The Committee may specify a minimum number of Shares that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option, provided that such minimum number will not prevent any Participant from exercising the Option for the full number of Shares for which it is then exercisable. 5.8 Limitations on ISOs . With respect to Awards granted as ISOs, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which such ISOs are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate) exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), such Options will be treated as NQSOs. For purposes of this Section 5.8, ISOs will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted. In the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder are amended after the Effective Date to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to ISOs, such different limit will be automatically incorporated herein and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of such amendment. 5.9 Modification, Extension or Renewal . Subject to Section 27, the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options and authorize the grant of new Options in substitution therefor, provided that any such action may not, without the written consent of a Participant, impair any of such Participant&#8217;s rights under any Option previously granted. Any outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered will be treated in accordance with Section 424(h) of the Code. Except as provided in Section 2.6 or 20, the Committee may not, without stockholder approval, seek to effect any re-pricing of any previously granted &#8220;underwater&#8221; Option or similar Award by: (i) amending or modifying the terms of the Option or similar Award to lower the exercise price; (ii) canceling the underwater Option or similar Award and granting either (A) replacement Options or similar Awards having a lower exercise price or (B) Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards or similar Awards in exchange; or (iii) canceling or repurchasing the underwater Options or similar 102 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents Awards for cash or other securities. An Option or similar Award will be deemed to be &#8220;underwater&#8221; at any time when the Fair Market Value of the Shares covered by such Award is less than the exercise price of the Award. 5.10 No Disqualification . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, no term of this Plan relating to ISOs will be interpreted, amended or altered, nor will any discretion or authority granted under this Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify this Plan under Section 422 of the Code or, without the consent of the Participant affected, to disqualify any ISO under Section 422 of the Code. 6.

Any Participant who is permitted to execute a promissory note as partial or full consideration for the purchase of Shares under this Plan will be required to pledge and deposit with the Company all or part of the Shares so purchased as collateral to secure the payment of the Participant&#8217;s obligation to the Company under the promissory note; provided , however , that the Committee may require or accept other or additional forms of collateral to secure the payment of such obligation and, in any event, the Company will have full recourse against the Participant under the promissory note notwithstanding any pledge of the Participant&#8217;s Shares or other collateral. In connection with any pledge of the Shares, the Participant will be required to execute and deliver a written pledge agreement in such form as the Committee will from time to time approve. The Shares purchased with the promissory note may be released from the pledge on a pro rata basis as the promissory note is paid. 18. SECURITIES LAW AND OTHER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE . An Award will not be effective unless such Award is in compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, as they are in effect on the date of grant of the Award and also on the date of exercise or other issuance. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Company will have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under this Plan prior to: (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and/or (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. The Company will be under no obligation to register the Shares with the SEC or to effect compliance with the registration, qualification or listing requirements of any foreign or state securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company will have no liability for any inability or failure to do so. 19. NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY . Nothing in this Plan or any Award granted under this Plan will confer or be deemed to confer on any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate to terminate Participant&#8217;s employment or other relationship at any time. 20. CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS . 20.1 Assumption or Replacement of Awards by Successor . In the event of a Corporate Transaction any or all outstanding Awards may be assumed or replaced by the successor corporation, which assumption or replacement shall be binding on all Participants. In the alternative, the successor corporation may substitute equivalent Awards or provide substantially similar consideration to Participants as was provided to stockholders (after taking into account the existing provisions of the Awards). Any such consideration shall be made promptly following such Corporate Transaction or on a specified date or dates following such Corporate Transaction; provided that the timing of such payment shall comply with Section 409A of the Code. The successor corporation may also issue, in place of outstanding Shares or Awards held by the Participant, substantially similar shares or other property subject to restrictions not materially less favorable to the Participant. In the event such successor or acquiring corporation (if any) refuses to assume, convert, replace or substitute Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction, then notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, such Awards shall have their vesting accelerate as to all shares subject to such Award (and any applicable right of repurchase 2025 Proxy Statement | 107 Table of Contents fully lapse) immediately prior to the Corporate Transaction unless otherwise determined by the Board and then such Awards will terminate. In addition, in the event such successor or acquiring corporation (if any) refuses to assume, convert, replace or substitute Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction, the Committee will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that such Award will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and such Award will terminate upon the expiration of such period. Awards need not be treated similarly in a Corporate Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Intrinsic Value of an Option or SAR is equal to or less than zero, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the cancellation of such Awards without payment of any consideration therefor (for the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Corporate Transaction, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate any Option or SAR for which the Exercise Price is equal to or exceeds the per Share value of the consideration to be paid in the Corporate Transaction without payment of consideration therefor). 20.2 Assumption of Awards by the Company . The Company, from time to time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or otherwise, by either; (a) granting an Award under this Plan in substitution of such other company&#8217;s award; or (b) assuming such award as if it had been granted under this Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under this Plan. Such substitution or assumption will be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under this Plan if the other company had applied the rules of this Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award will remain unchanged ( except that the Purchase Price or the Exercise Price, as the case may be, and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon exercise or settlement of any such Award will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to Section 424(a) of the Code). In the event the Company elects to grant a new Option in substitution rather than assuming an existing option, such new Option may be granted with a similarly adjusted Exercise Price. 20.3 Non-Employee Directors&#8217; Awards . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, in the event of a Corporate Transaction, the vesting of all Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors shall accelerate and such Awards shall become exercisable (as applicable) in full prior to the consummation of such event at such times and on such conditions as the Committee determines. 21. ADOPTION AND STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL . This Plan shall be submitted for the approval of the Company&#8217;s stockholders, consistent with applicable laws, within twelve (12) months before or after the date this Plan is adopted by the Board. 22. TERM OF PLAN/GOVERNING LAW . Unless earlier terminated as provided herein, this Plan will become effective on the Effective Date and will terminate ten (10) years from the Effective Date. This Plan and all Awards granted hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. 23. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN . 23.1 The Board may at any time terminate or amend this Plan in any respect, including, without limitation, amendment of any form of Award Agreement or instrument to be executed pursuant to this Plan; provided , however , that the Board will not, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, amend this Plan in any manner that requires such stockholder approval; provided further , subject to Section 2.6 and Section 20, that no such amendment or termination shall be made without the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would materially adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award, except (x) to the extent any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance or termination is made to cause the Plan to comply with applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations or (y) to impose any &#8220;clawback&#8221; or recoupment provisions on any Awards (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Awards). 23.2 The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted (including by substituting another Award of the same or a different type), prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of any relevant Participant or holder or beneficiary of an Award; provided , however , that, subject to Section 2.6 and Section 20, no such action shall materially adversely affect the rights of any affected Participant or holder or beneficiary under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan, except (x) to the extent any such action is made to cause the Plan or Award to comply with applicable law, stock market or exchange rules and regulations or accounting or tax rules and regulations, or (y) to impose any &#8220;clawback&#8221; or recoupment provisions on any Awards (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Awards). 24. NONEXCLUSIVITY OF THE PLAN . Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board, the submission of this Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval, nor any provision of this Plan will be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such additional compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without 108 | 2025 Proxy Statement Table of Contents limitation, the granting of stock awards and bonuses otherwise than under this Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. 25. INSIDER TRADING POLICY . Each Participant who receives an Award shall comply with any policy adopted by the Company from time to time covering transactions in the Company&#8217;s securities by Employees, officers and/or Directors of the Company. 26. CANCELLATION OR &#8220;CLAWBACK&#8221; OF AWARDS . The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that a Participant&#8217;s rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Any Awards granted under the Plan (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Awards) shall be subject to any clawback or recoupment arrangements, policies or procedures the Company has in place from time to time (including the Company&#8217;s Compensation Recoupment Policy and any other policy necessary to comply with applicable laws), and the Committee may, to the extent permitted by applicable law or by any applicable Company policy or arrangement, and shall, to the extent required, cancel or require reimbursement of any Awards granted to the Participant or any Shares issued or cash received upon vesting, exercise or settlement of any such Awards or sale of Shares underlying such Awards. 27. SECTION 409A OF THE CODE . With respect to Awards subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan is intended to comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall be operated accordingly. If any provision of the Plan or any term or condition of any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this conflict. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee considers a Participant to be a &#8220;specified employee&#8221; under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such Participant&#8217;s &#8220;separation from service&#8221; (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), and any amount hereunder is &#8220;deferred compensation&#8221; subject to Section 409A of the Code, any distribution of such amount that otherwise would be made to such Participant with respect to an Award as a result of such &#8220;separation from service&#8221; shall not be made until the date that is six months after such &#8220;separation from service,&#8221; except to the extent that earlier distribution would not result in such Participant&#8217;s incurring interest or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. If an Award includes a &#8220;series of installment payments&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations), a Participant&#8217;s right to such series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment, and if an Award includes &#8220;dividend equivalents&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-3(e) of the Treasury Regulations), a Participant&#8217;s right to such dividend equivalents shall be treated separately from the right to other amounts under the Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan or any Award Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed, and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by a Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 28. MISCELLANEOUS . 28.1 Successors and Assigns; Severability . The terms of the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor entity, including any successor entity contemplated by Section 20. If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any Participant or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award Agreement, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Participant or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 28.2 No Trust or Fund Created . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. 28.3 No Right to Awards . No Employee, Consultant, Director, Participant, or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Any Award granted under the Plan shall be a one-time Award that does not constitute a promise of future grants. The Company, in its sole discretion, maintains the right to make available future grants under the Plan. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any severance, pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder. 2025 Proxy Statement | 109 Table of Contents 29.
