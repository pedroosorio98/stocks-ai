Earnings per share were $1.01, compared with $0.82 in the third quarter of 2009. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Our third-quarter net income of $4.4 billion was the result of the good underlyi ng performance of our businesses. The Investment Bank delivered solid earnings while main taining its number one ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees. Retail Financial Services reported strong mortgage loan production. Card Services increased sales volume by 7% compared with the prior year, and positive credit trends assisted in delivering improved results. Commercial Banking reported record revenue, while Asset Management had strong net inflows of $38 billion this quarter.” Dimon added: “We are pleased to report a continued overall decline in credit costs, although our mortgage and credit card portfolios continued to be ar very high net charge-offs. Our mortgage delinquency trends remained relatively flat compare d with the prior quarter, and we expect mortgage credit losses to remain at these high leve ls for the next several quarters. If economic conditions worsen, mortgage credit losses could tre nd higher. With respect to our credit card portfolio, delinquencies and net charge-offs contin ued to improve, and we reduced loan loss reserves by $1.5 billion this quarter as estimated losses declined. We expect credit card net charge- offs to continue to improve next quarter.” Commenting on the Firm’s balance sheet, Dimon said: “Our fortress balance sheet continued to strengthen, ending the quarter with a strong Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.5%. We believe that the quality of our balance sheet will position us well for the eventual implementation of new capital standards being developed by bank regulators. Our t otal firmwide credit reserves declined to $35.0 billion, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 5.1% of total loans 1.” Dimon further remarked: “We are firmly committed to doing all we can to support the ongoing economic recovery. We are providing capital, financ ing and liquidity to our clients in the U.S. and around the world. So far this year, we have loaned or raised capital for our clients of more than $1.0 trillion, and our small-business originations were up 37%. In add ition, we are on track to hire over 10,000 people in the U.S. this year.” “Regarding regulatory reform, we will work with our regulators as they proceed with the extensive rulemaking required to implement financial reforms. We will continue to devote substantial resources to ensure regulatory reforms are implemen ted in a way that preserves the value we deliver to our clients.” Looking forward, Dimon concluded: “The Firm has exc ellent client franchises with leading positions in their respective markets, a strong bal ance sheet, and plenty of capital. With these fundamental strengths, we will continue to serve ou r clients and build our franchises for many years to come while providing good returns to our shareholders.” In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a Firm, information is presented on a managed basis.

The decrease from the prior year ref lected lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and a benefit from the provisio n for credit losses; the decrease from the prior quarter reflected lower revenue and a lower benefit from the provision for credit losses, largely offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $5.4 billion, compared with $7.5 bi llion in the prior year and $6.3 billion in the prior quarter. Investment banking fees were $1.5 bi llion, down 9% from the prior year and up 7% from the prior quarter; these consisted of equity u nderwriting fees of $333 million (down 51% from the prior year and 6% from the prior quarter), debt underwriting fees of $784 million (up 32% from the prior year and 13% from the prior quar ter) and advisory fees of $385 million (flat compared with the prior year and up 8% from the pri or quarter). Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.1 billion, compared with $5.0 billion in the prior year and $3.6 billion in the prior quarter. The decrease from the prior year largely reflected lower results in credit and rates markets; the decrease from the prior quarter primarily reflected losses of $149 million from the tightening of the Firm’s credit spreads on certain structured lia bilities, compared with gains of $397 million in the prior quarter. Equity Markets revenue was $1.1 billion, compared with $941 million in the prior year and $1.0 billion in the prior quarter, r eflecting solid client revenue. The current period also included losses of $96 million from the tighte ning of the Firm’s credit spreads on certain structured liabilities, compared with gains of $191 million in the prior quarter. Credit Portfolio revenue was a loss of $407 million, primarily refle cting the negative net impact of credit spreads on derivative assets and liabilities, partially off set by net interest income and fees on retained loans. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $1 42 million, compared with an expense of $379 million in the prior year. The current-quarter prov ision reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, largely related to net repayments and loan sales. The allowance for loan losses to end- of-period loans retained was 3.85%, compared with 8 .44% in the prior year. The decline in the allowance ratio was due largely to the consolidatio n of asset-backed commercial paper conduits in accordance with new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2010; excluding these balances, the current-quarter allowance coverage ratio was 6. 20%. Net charge-offs were $33 million, compared with $750 million in the prior year. Nonpe rforming loans were $2.4 billion, down by $2.5 billion from the prior year and up by $126 million from the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $3.7 billion, down 13% from the prior year and 18% from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower compensation expens e and the absence of the U.K. bonus tax recorded in the prior quarter.

Noninterest revenue was $2.8 billion, down by $276 million, or 9%, as lower deposit-related fees and mortgage fees and related income were partially offset by higher debit card income and auto operating lease income. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion from the prior year and $167 million from the prior quarter. While delinque ncy trends and net charge-offs improved compared with the prior year, the current-quarter p rovision continued to reflect elevated losses for the mortgage and home equity portfolios.

The provision for credit losses was $175 million, d own $33 million compared with the prior year. Retail Banking net charge-offs were $175 million (4 .18% net charge-off rate), compared with $208 million (4.66% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, up 5% compare d with the prior year, resulting from sales force increases in Business Banking and bank branches.

Total production revenue was a net loss of $231 million, a decrease of $161 million compared with the prior year.

Net mortgage servicing revenue, which J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 comprises operating revenue and MSR risk management , was $936 million, a decrease of $7 million. Operating revenue was $549 million, an inc rease of $41 million, reflecting an improvement in other changes in MSR asset fair valu e driven by lower runoff of the MSR asset due to time decay, largely offset by lower loan ser vicing revenue as a result of lower third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management revenue was $387 million, a decrease of $48 million. The provision for credit losses, predominantly rela ted to the student and auto loan portfolios, was $176 million, compared with $222 million in the pri or year.

The improvement was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net revenue was $1.3 billion, down by $282 million, or 18%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income as a result of lower loan balances, reflecting net portfolio runoff, and a decline in mortgage loan yields. The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, c ompared with $3.6 billion in the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflected improved delinq uency trends and a $902 million reduction in net charge-offs.

Discussion of Results: Net income was $735 million, compared with a net lo ss of $700 million in the prior year. The improved results were driven by a lower provision f or credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. End-of-period loans were $136.4 billion, a decrease of $28.8 billion, or 17%, from the prior year and $6.6 billion, or 5%, from the prior quarter. Av erage loans were $140.1 billion, a decrease of $29.1 billion, or 17%, from the prior year and $6.2 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. The declines in both end-of-period and average loans were consistent with expected portfolio runoff. Net revenue was $4.3 billion, a decrease of $906 mi llion, or 18%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.4 billion, down by $881 million, or 2 0%. The decrease was driven by lower average loan balances, the impact of legislative ch anges and a decreased level of fees. These decreases were offset partially by lower revenue re versals associated with lower charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $806 million, a decrease of $25 million, or 3%, due to lower revenue from fee-based products. The provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion, c ompared with $5.0 billion in the prior year and $2.2 billion in the prior quarter.

Net interest income was $392 million, down by $12 million, or 3%, due to narrower deposit and loan spreads, offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Revenue from Private Banking was $1.2 billion, up 9 % from the prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $506 million, down 5%. Revenue from Retail was $485 million, up 3%.

As a result, reported and managed basis are equivalent for periods beginning after January 1, 2010. See notes on page 13 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $23,824 million, $25,101 million and $26,622 million for the third quarter of 2010, second quarter of 2010, and third quarter of 2009, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $4.4 billion, up by $830 million, or 23%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by a significantly lower provis ion for credit losses, predominantly offset by lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $24.3 billion, a decrease of $4.4 b illion, or 15%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $11.7 billion, down by $2.2 billion, or 16%, from the prior year driven by lower principal transactions revenue, largely reflecting lower trading results. Net interest income was $12.6 billion, down by $2.2 billion, or 15%, driven by lower loan balances. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 The provision for credit losses was $3.2 billion, d own by $6.6 billion, or 67%, from the prior year. The resulting firmwide allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans retained 1 was 5.12%, compared with 5.28% in the prior year. The total co nsumer provision for credit losses was $3.2 billion, compared with $9.0 billion in the prior ye ar, reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit losses as a result of improved delinquency trends and reduced net charge-offs. Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $4.7 billion, compared with $7.0 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge- off rates of 4.64% and 6.29%, respectively. The who lesale provision for credit losses was $44 million compared with $779 million in the prior yea r, reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit losses predominantly as a result of continue d improvement in the credit quality of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, reduced n et charge-offs and net repayments. Wholesale net charge-offs were $266 million, compared with $1 .1 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.49% and 1.93%, respectively. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $17.7 billion at September 30, 2010, down from the prior-year level of $20.4 billion and the prior-quarter level of $18.2 billion. Noninterest expense was $14.4 billion, up by $943 m illion, or 7%, largely due to increased litigation expense.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s resu lts and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition o f managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes ce rtain reclassifications to present total net revenu e for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comp arable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparabili ty of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exe mpt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Prior to January 1, 2010, the Firm’s managed-basis presentation also included certain reclassification adjustments that assumed credit card loans securitized by CS remained on the balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance that amended the accounting for the transf er of financial assets and the consolidation of VIE s. Additionally, the new guidance required the Firm to consolidate its Firm- sponsored credit card securitizations trusts. The i ncome, expense and credit costs associated with these securitization activiti es are now recorded in the 2010 Consolidated Statem ents of Income in the same classifications that were previously used to report such items on a managed basis. As a result of the consolidation of the credit card securitization trusts, reported and managed ba sis relating to credit card securitizations are com parable for periods beginning after January 1, 2010. The presentation in 2009 of CS results on a managed basis assumed that credit card loans that had been securitized and sold in accordance with U.S. GAAP remained on the Consolida ted Balance Sheets, and that the earnings on the se curitized loans were classified in the same manner as the earnings on re tained loans recorded on the Consolidated Balance S heets. JPMorgan Chase used the concept of managed basis to evaluate the c redit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations were funded and decisions were made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based on managed financial information. In addition , the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and s ecuritized loans. Although securitizations result i n the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers ma y continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit pe rformance affects both the securitized loans and th e loans retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. JPMorgan Chase believe d that this managed-basis information was useful to investors, as it enabled them to understand both the credit risks as sociated with the loans reported on the Consolidate d Balance Sheets and the Firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. b. The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to e nd-of-period loans excludes the following: loans ac counted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired loan s; the allowance for loan losses related to purchas ed credit-impaired loans; and, loans from the Washington Mutual Master Trust, which were consolidated on the Firm's balance shee t at fair value during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, Real Esta te Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impa ct of purchased credit- impaired loans. The allowance for loan losses relat ed to the purchased credit-impaired portfolio was $ 2.8 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010, and September 30, 2009, respectively. c. Tier 1 common capital (“Tier 1 common”) is defin ed as Tier 1 capital less elements of capital not i n the form of common equity – such as perpetual preferred stock, noncont rolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferr ed capital debt securities. Tier 1 common, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to asses s and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common along with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. d. Headcount-related expense includes salary and be nefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. e. TSS firmwide revenue includes certain TSS produc t revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business – mainly CB, RFS and AM – related to customers who are also customers of those lines of business. f. Pretax margin represents income before income ta x expense divided by total net revenue, which is, i n management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken in to consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to ev aluate the performance of TSS and AM against the pe rformance of their respective competitors. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The acquisition resulted in negative goodwill, and accordingly, the Firm recognized an extraordinary gain. A preliminary gain of $1.9 billion was recognized at December 31, 2008. The final total extraordinary gain that resulted from the Washington Mutual transaction was $2.0 billion. For the third quarter of 2009, and based on income before extraordinary gain, return on common equity remained at 9%, return on tangible common equity was 13% and return on assets was 0.70%. (b) For further discussion of managed basis, see Note a. on page 13. (c) On June 5, 2009, the Firm issued $5.8 billion, or 163 mi llion shares, of its common stock at $35.25 per share. (d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts. (e) The Firm uses return on tangible common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the Firm's use of equity and to f acilitate comparisons with competitors. For further discussion of ROTCE, see page 41 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (f) Tier 1 common capital ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by risk-weighted assets. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital a long with the other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of Tier 1 common capital ratio, see page 41 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. (g) Effective January 1, 2010, the Firm adopted new guidance that amended the accounting for the transfer of financial assets a nd the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Upon adoption of the new guidance, the Firm consolidated its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts, Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and certain other consumer loan securitization entities, primarily mortgage-related, adding $87.7 billion and $92.2 billion of assets and liabilities, respectively, and decreasing stockholders’ equity and the Tier I capital ratio by $4.5 billion and 34 basis points, respectively. The reduction to stockholders’ equity was driven by the establishment of an allowance for loan losses of $7.5 billion (pretax) primarily related to receivables held in credit card securitization trusts that were consolidated at the adoption date. For further details regarding the Firm's application and impact of the new accounting guidance, see Note 14 on pages 130-131, Note 15 on pages 131-142 and Note 22 on pages 149-152 of JPMorgan Chase's March 31, 2010, Form 10-Q.
