We continue to see positive momentum with the U.S. consumer – healthy confidence levels, solid job creation and rising wages – which are reflected in our Consumer & Community Banking results. Double-digit growth in credit card sales and merchant processing volumes reflected healthy consumer spending and drove 8% growth in credit card loans, while mortgage and auto originations showed solid improvement, and we continued to attract new deposits, up 3%. Client investment assets were up 16%, driven by both physical and digital channels, including You Invest.” Dimon added: “In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Markets performance was relatively steady on slightly lower client volume, probably due to slightly higher global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Treasury Services and Securities Services demonstrated good organic growth despite headwinds from rates. Although the global wallet was down, year-to-date the Firm ranked #1 in Global IB fees and gained share across products and regions, with particular strength from Commercial Banking, where gross IB revenue was up 8% for the first half of the year. And in Asset & Wealth Management, AUM and client assets grew 7%, both due to higher asset values and net inflows into long-term and liquidity products.” Dimon concluded: “We were pleased to announce a meaningful increase to our dividend and repurchases. While we always prefer to invest capital back into the business, our capital plan provides us with the capacity and flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders. We have opened new branches, announced strategic acquisitions like InstaMed, and invested in digital products to deepen our engagement with our customers, who have now opened over 2 million accounts digitally and activated over 60 million Chase Offers. We also continued our investments in local communities – for example, we expanded our long-term commitment to Detroit from $150 million to $200 million as we continue to learn how to drive inclusive growth in the communities around the world that need the most support.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS 2Q19 results include $768 million of firmwide income tax benefits ($0.23 increase in earnings per share) FORTRESS PRINCIPLES Book value per share of $73.77, up 7%; tangible book value per share2 of $59.42, up 8% Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $189 billion and ratio3 of 12.2% Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.4% OPERATING LEVERAGE 2Q19 reported expense of $16.3 billion; reported overhead ratio of 57%; managed overhead ratio2 of 55% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED $7.5 billion5 distributed to shareholders in 2Q19 $5.0 billion of net repurchases and common dividend of $0.80 per share SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES $1.1 trillion of credit and capital8 raised YTD $119 billion of credit for consumers $14 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses $435 billion of credit for corporations $547 billion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities $34 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 2 In the discussion below of Firmwide results of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), information is presented on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, unless otherwise specified. The discussion below of the Firm’s business segments is also presented on a managed basis. For more information about managed basis, and non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, refer to page 6. Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the second quarter of 2019 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM) Net revenue on a reported basis was $28.8 billion, $29.1 billion, and $27.8 billion for the second quarter of 2019, first quarter of 2019, and second quarter of 2018, respectively.

Net revenue was $29.6 billion, up 4%. Net interest income was $14.5 billion, up 7%, driven by balance sheet growth and mix, as well as the impact of higher rates. Noninterest revenue was $15.0 billion, up approximately $300 million, or 2%, driven by several notable items. Excluding these items, noninterest revenue was relatively flat, with strength in Consumer and Community Banking, offset by lower investment banking fees in the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking, as well as lower Markets noninterest revenue. Noninterest expense was $16.3 billion, up 2%, driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges. The provision for firmwide credit losses was $1.1 billion, down 5% as the consumer provision of $1.1 billion was relatively flat to prior year and the wholesale provision of $27 million decreased by $75 million.

Net revenue was $13.8 billion, an increase of 11%. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $6.8 billion, up 11%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income as a result of higher deposit margins and balance growth. Home Lending net revenue was $1.1 billion, down 17%, driven by mortgage servicing rights (MSR) adjustments, reflecting updates to model inputs. Excluding this adjustment, revenue would have been up 4%, driven by higher net production revenue, largely offset by lower net interest income due to the impact of spread compression and lower balances. Card, Merchant Services & Auto net revenue was $5.9 billion, up 18%, including the impact of a rewards liability adjustment of approximately $330 million in the prior year. Excluding this adjustment, revenue would have been up 11%, driven by higher Card net interest income on loan growth and margin expansion, and higher auto lease volumes. Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 4%, largely driven by technology, marketing and other investments in the business, as well as higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, relatively flat compared with the prior year, as higher net charge-offs were offset by a net reserve release. The increase in net charge-offs was driven by Home Lending, which included a recovery from a loan sale in the prior year, as well as by higher net charge-offs in Card on loan growth. The current quarter included a reserve release of $400 million in the Home Lending purchased credit-impaired portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, partially offset by a reserve build of $200 million in Card driven by loan growth and mix.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $73.77, $71.78 and $68.85 at June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2018, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 7 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
