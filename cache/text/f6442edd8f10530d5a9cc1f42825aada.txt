Certain subsidiaries of Broadcom Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) have entered into two separate multi-year statement of work agreements (the &#8220;2020 SOWs&#8221;) with Apple Inc. (&#8220;Apple&#8221;). Both are for the supply of a range of specified high-performance wireless components and modules to Apple for use in its products. The 2020 SOWs are in addition to the agreement between the Company and Apple entered into on June&#160;9, 2019, which remains in effect with respect to the supply of specified RF components and modules to Apple (the &#8220;2019 SOW&#8221;). The 2020 SOWs, and the remaining portion of the 2019 SOW, apply to Apple products launched during the three and a half year period beginning in January 2020 (the &#8220;Covered Products&#8221;). The Company estimates that, based on past experience, and subject to the Company&#8217;s ability to satisfy its applicable contractual obligations, the 2020 SOWs and the 2019 SOW could, collectively, generate aggregate total future revenue associated with the Covered Products of approximately $15&#160;billion for the Company.
