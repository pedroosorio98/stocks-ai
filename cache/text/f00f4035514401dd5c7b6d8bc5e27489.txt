Our CET1 capital ratio rose even further to 14.3%. Our total loss-absorbing capacity (equity plus long-term debt) is a formidable $496 billion, while loans, which are our riskiest assets, are at $1.3 trillion. Our liquidity is extraordinarily high with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 trillion. Looking ahead to Basel III finalization, we intend to adapt and manage to the new rules very quickly as we have shown in the past. However, we caution that such material regulatory changes would likely have real world consequences for markets and end users.” Dimon continued: “Our lines of business saw continued momentum in the quarter, demonstrating the power of our years of investment and the value of our consistency and fortress principles. Across the Firm, we continued to add a sizable number of new clients and deepen relationships. In CCB, we again ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits based on the most recent FDIC data, and we extended our leadership position as our growth from net new accounts was over 3x that of peers. In CIB, we maintained our #1 Dealogic rank and gained IB market share YTD. In CB, Payments revenue remained strong and was up 30%. And AWM saw AUM net inflows of $60 billion. Finally, we extended credit and raised $1.7 trillion in capital for businesses, governments, and U.S. consumers year to date.” Dimon concluded: “Currently, U.S. consumers and businesses generally remain healthy, although, consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers. However, persistently tight labor markets as well as extremely high government debt levels with the largest peacetime fiscal deficits ever are increasing the risks that inflation remains elevated and that interest rates rise further from here. Additionally, we still do not know the longer-term consequences of quantitative tightening, which reduces liquidity in the system at a time when market-making capabilities are increasingly limited by regulations. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine compounded by last week’s attacks on Israel may have far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships. This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades. While we hope for the best, we prepare the Firm for a broad range of outcomes so we can consistently deliver for clients no matter the environment. To conclude, I want to thank our extraordinary employees for all of their hard work in making us one of the most trusted financial institutions in the world.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 3Q23 results included: n $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate ($0.17 decrease in earnings per share (EPS)) n $665 million of Firmwide legal expense8 ($0.22 decrease in EPS) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.1 billion or $1.05 per share n $2.0 billion of common stock net repurchases9 n Net payout LTM9,10 of 35% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $100.30, up 15%; tangible book value per share2 of $82.04, up 17% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $242 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 14.3%; Advanced ratio3 of 14.5% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 3Q23 expense of $21.8 billion; reported overhead ratio of 55%; managed overhead ratio2 of 53% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $1.7 trillion of credit and capital11 raised YTD n $182 billion of credit for consumers n $27 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $775 billion of credit for corporations n $709 billion of capital for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $37 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities Exhibit 99.1 JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-2438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the third quarter of 2023 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 100.30, $98.11 and $ 87.00 at September 30, 2023 , June 30, 2023 , and September 30, 2022 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets (“Markets”, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets). Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 29 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 70 of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.

There is no assurance that such discussions will result in a resolution.
