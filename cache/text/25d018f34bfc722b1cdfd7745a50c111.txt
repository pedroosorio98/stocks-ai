Markets revenue also increased 10%. In CCB, we opened over 450 thousand net new checking accounts, our 50th consecutive quarter of net new account growth. Client investment assets were up 14% to $1.0 trillion, and we also had a record number of first-time investors. Additionally, Card loans were up 12% on continued robust customer acquisition of 2.4 million. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees were up 13%, and we saw $79 billion of client asset net inflows. Pretax margin remained strong at 32%.” Dimon continued: “While market valuations and credit spreads seem to reflect a rather benign economic outlook, we continue to be vigilant about potential tail risks. These tail risks are the same ones that we have mentioned before. The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown. Next, there has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world. Therefore, inflation and interest rates may stay higher than the market expects. And finally, we still do not know the full effects of quantitative tightening on this scale.” Dimon added: “We now have a CET1 capital ratio of 15.3%, providing us with excess capital even after the uncertainty created by Basel III endgame. Last month, we announced that the Board intends to increase our common dividend for the second time this year, resulting in a 19% cumulative increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase is supported by our strong financial performance and represents a sustainable level of dividends. Our priorities remain unchanged. We continue to invest heavily into our businesses for long-term growth and profitability. We maintain a fortress balance sheet and prepare the Firm for a wide range of potential environments.” Dimon concluded: “Finally, we take pride in driving economic growth by extending credit and raising capital totaling more than $1.4 trillion YTD for large and small businesses, governments and U.S. consumers.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN CORPORATE IN 2Q24 RESULTS n $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares ($2.04 increase in EPS10) n $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation ($0.18 decrease in EPS) n $546 million of net investment securities losses ($0.14 decrease in EPS) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.3 billion or $1.15 per share n $4.9 billion of common stock net repurchases11 n Net payout LTM11,12 of 45% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $111.29, up 13%; tangible book value per share2 of $92.77, up 16% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $267 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 15.3%; Advanced ratio3 of 15.5% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 6.1% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n More than $1.4 trillion of credit and capital13 raised YTD, reflecting approximately n $120 billion of credit for consumers n $20 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $1.3 trillion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $30 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Joseph Evangelisti (212) 270-7438 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the second quarter of 2024 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Net revenue was $51.0 billion, up 20%. Net interest income (“NII”) was $22.9 billion, up 4%. NII excluding Markets 2 was $22.9 billion, up 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in Card Services and one additional month of First Republic-related net interest income , largely offset by deposit margin compression a cross the LOBs and lower deposit balances in CCB. Noninterest revenue was $28.1 billion, up 37%. Excluding the $7.9 billion net gai n related to Visa shares, as well as the estimated bargain purchase gain associated with First Republic of $2.7 billion in the prior- year quarter, noninterest revenue was up 14%, predominantly driven by higher investment banking fees, asset management fees and CIB Markets noninterest revenue. The current and prior-year quarters included net investment securities losses. Noninterest expense was $23.7 billion, up 14%. Excluding the $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation in Corporate , noninterest expense was up 9%, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in employees. The provision for credit losses was $ 3.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs of $2.2 billion were up $820 million, predominantly driven by Card Services. The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer, primarily in Card Services, and $189 million in Wholesale. The prior-year provision was $2.9 billion, reflecting a net reserve bu ild of $1.5 billion, predominantly associated with First Republic, as well as ne t charge- offs of $1.4 billion. The First Republic acquisition 14 closed on May 1, 2023, therefore, the current period included approximately one additional month of results associated with First Republic compar ed with the prior -year period. Additionally, certain noninterest expense and deposits associated with First Republic were allocated among segments commencing in the third quarter of 2023, resulting in increases or decreases to the YoY change in certain line items. The prior-year quarter also included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion in Corporate as well as the $1.2 billio n credit reserve established for the First Republic portfolio across the LOBs.

Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 3%. Banking & Wealth Management net revenue was $10.4 billion, down 5%, driven by lower net interest income on lower deposit balances and deposit margin compression, partially offset by higher asset management fees in J.P. Morgan Wealth Management . Home Lending net revenue was $1.3 billion, up 31%, predominantly driven by higher net interest income including one additional month of First Republic-related net interest income compared with the prior period . Card Services & Auto net revenue was $6.0 billion, up 14%, driven by Card Services, reflecting higher net interest income on higher revolving balances and higher card income on higher sales volume. Noninterest expense was $9.4 billion, up 13%, predominantly driven by the allocation of certain First Republic-related expense from Corporate to CCB starting in the third quarter of 2023, and higher compensation, largely for advisors, bankers and technology employees, as well as continued investments in technology and marketing. The provision for credit losses was $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2 .1 billion and a net reserve build of $579 million. Net charge-offs of $2.1 billion were up $813 million, predominantly driven by Card Services as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues.

News Release 5 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $111.29, $106.81 and $98.11 at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to page 75 of the Firm’s 2023 Form 10-K. d. Second-quarter 2024 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Significant items collectively refer to a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa share s, a $1.0 billion donation of Visa shares to pre-fund contributions to the Firm’s Foundation and $546 million of net investment securities losses. Excluding these items resulted in a decrease of $5.0 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $18.1 billion to $13.1 billion, a decrease of $1.72 per share to reported EPS from $6.12 to $4.40 and a decrease of 8ppts to reported ROTCE from 28% to 20%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). All references in this press release to “excluding First Republic,” “First Republic-related,” “associated with First Republic” or “attributable to First Republic” refer to excluding or including the relevant effects of the First Republic acquisition, as well as subsequent related business and activities, as applicable. 15. As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As of June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured using the Firm’s modeled approach. Refer to the Critical Accounting E stimates on pages 78-80 and Note 26 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 for additional information.
