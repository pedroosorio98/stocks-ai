GTC 2023 Financial Analyst Q&A March 21, 2023 Except for the historical information contained herein, certain matters in this presentation including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, features and availability of our products, technologies, and services, including Grace, Grace Hopper, BlueField-3, NVIDIA L40, NVIDIA L4, NVIDIA H100 including DGX H100, cuLitho, Spark RAPIDS, cuQuantum, NVIDIA AI Foundations, NVIDIA DGX Cloud, CUDA, NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA Picasso, NVIDIA BioNeMo including BioNeMo Models, NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA HGX, NVIDIA EGX, NVIDIA AGX, NVIDIA IGX, NVIDIA CLARA, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA cuOpt, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine, NVIDIA Tokkio, NVIDIA Riva, NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, NVIDIA Inference Platform, and NVIDIA Holoscan; NVIDIA’s accelerated computing ecosystem expanding; NVIDIA CLARA driving innovation across the pharmaceutical industry; our markets and market opportunity; our collaborations and partnerships; third parties adopting our products, technologies, and services; and the growing NVIDIA DRIVE design win pipeline are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements and any other forward-looking statements that go beyond historical facts that are made in this presentation are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: global economic conditions; our reliance on third parties to manufacture, assemble, package and test our products; the impact of technological development and competition; development of new products and technologies or enhancements to our existing product and technologies; market acceptance of our products or our partners' products; design, manufacturing or software defects; changes in consumer preferences and demands; changes in industry standards and interfaces; unexpected loss of performance of our products or technologies when integrated into systems and other factors. NVIDIA has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy,short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely upon the forward- looking statements as predictions of future events. The future events and trends discussed in this presentation may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Although NVIDIA believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the company cannot guarantee that future results, levels of activity, performance, achievements or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Except as required by law, NVIDIA disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. For a complete discussion of factors that could materially affect our financial results and operations, please refer to the reports we file from time to time with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Copies of reports we file with the SEC are posted on our website and are available from NVIDIA without charge.
