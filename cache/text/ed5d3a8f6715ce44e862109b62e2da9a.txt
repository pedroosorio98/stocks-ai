The increase reflected strong revenue growth, pr imarily offset by an increase in noninterest expense, primarily driven by performance-based compensation, as well as an increase in the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $5.8 billion, up by $1.5 billion, or 34%, from the prior year, driven by record investment banking fees and str ong markets results. Investment banking fees of $1.9 billion were up 39% from the prior year, driven by record advisory fees, strong debt underwriting fees and record equity underwriting fees. Debt underwriting fees of $831 million were up 27%, driven by record loan syndication fees. Advisory fees of $560 million were up 59%, benefiting from strong performance across all regions. E quity underwriting fees of $509 million were up 40%, reflecting strong performance in Asia an d Europe. Fixed Income Markets revenue increased 15% from the prior year, to $2.4 billion, driven by strong results across most products, partially offset by weaker commoditie s performance versus a strong prior-year quarter. Equity Markets revenue of $1.2 billion more than doubled from the prior year, benefiting from strong global derivatives and cash equities trading performance. Credit Portfolio revenue of $204 million was down 18% due largely to lower gains from loan sales and workouts. Provision for credit losses was $164 million compared with a benefit of $62 million in the prior year. The increase in the allowance for credit losses reflects portfolio activity.

Net revenue of $4.4 billion was up by $578 million, or 15%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.7 billion was up by $107 million, or 4%, due to The Bank of New York transaction and higher deposit balan ces. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business and a continued shift to narrower–spread deposit products. Noninterest revenue of $1.7 billion was up by $471 million, or 39%, benefiting from increased mortgage loan originations; increases in deposit-related fees; increased mortgage loan servicing revenue; and The Bank of New York transaction. Noni nterest revenue also benefited from the classification of certain mortgage loan origin ation costs as expense (loan origination costs previously netted against revenue are currently recorded as expense) due to the adoption of SFAS 159 (“Fair Value Option”) in the first quarter of 2007. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business. The provision for credit losses was $587 million compared with $100 million in the prior year. The increase in provision reflects weak housi ng prices in select ge ographic areas and the resulting increase in estimated losses for high loan-to-value home equity loans, especially those originated through the wholesale channel. Ho me equity underwriting standards were further tightened during the quarter, and pr icing actions were implemented to reflect elevated risks in this segment.

These increases were o ffset partially by the sale of the insurance business. Regional Banking net income of $629 million was dow n by $135 million, or 18%, from the prior year. Net revenue of $3.3 billion wa s up by $210 million, or 7%, benefiting from The Bank of New York transaction, increases in depos it-related fees and growth in deposits. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business and a continued shift to narrower–spread deposit products. The provision for credit losses was $494 million compared with $70 million in the prior ye ar. The increase was largely related to the home equity portfolio, as the allowance for loan losses related to this portfolio was in creased by $329 million. Home equity net charge-offs increased to $98 million in the current quarter from $30 million in the prior year (see Retail Financial Se rvices discussion of provision for credit losses for further detail).

Net managed revenue of $3.7 billion was up by $53 million, or 1%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $3.0 billion wa s flat compared with the prior year. Net interest income was negatively affected by the discontinuation of certain billing practices (including the elimination of certain over-limit fees and the two-cycle b illing method for calculating finance charges); higher charge-offs, which resulted in increased re venue reversals; and in creased cost of funds on growth in introductory and transactor balances. These decreases in net interest income were offset by increased average loans and higher fees.

Net revenue on a GAAP basis w as $18,908 million, $18,968 million and $15,086 million for the second quarter of 2007, first quarter of 2007 and second quarter of 2006, respectively. (b) Discontinued operations include the income statement activity of selected corporat e trust businesses sold to The Bank of Ne w York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quarter of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Treasury & Securities Services. Discussion of Results: Net income was $4.2 billion, up by $694 million, or 20% , from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher ne t managed revenue, partially o ffset by increased noninterest expense and higher managed provision for credit losses. Net managed revenue was $19.8 billion, up by $4.0 billion, or 25%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $12.0 billion was up by $2.9 billion, or 31%, reflecting the following: very strong private equity gains; increased asset management, administration, and commissions revenue; record investment banking fees; a lo wer level of securities losses; and higher mortgage-related fees. Net interest income was $7.8 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 16%, due to JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 12 improved trading net interest income; improved ne t interest income in the Corporate segment; an increase in consumer loans; and the impact of The Bank of New York transaction. This increase was offset partially by a shift to narrower–spread consumer loans. The managed provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion, up by $1.1 billion, or 101%, from the prior year. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $198 million for the quarter compared with a benefit of $77 million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in the allowance for credit losses related to portf olio activity. Wholesale net recoveries were $29 million in the current quarter compared with net recoveries of $19 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rates of 0.07% and 0.05%, respectively. The total consumer managed provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the prior y ear. The prior year benefited from significantly lower credit card net charge-offs, following the change in bankruptcy legislation in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the release of $90 million of provision related to Hurricane Katrina in Card Services. The increase from the prior year also reflected additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher charge-offs related to the home equity loan portfolio. The firm had total nonperfor ming assets of $2.6 billion at June 30, 2007, up by $202 million, or 8%, from the prior-year level of $2.4 billion. Noninterest expense was $11.0 billion, up by $1.6 billion, or 18%, from the prior year. Expense increased due to higher compensati on expense, primarily incentive-based, and increased net legal costs, reflecting a lower leve l of recoveries and higher expense. Expense growth was also driven by acquisi tions and investments in all of the businesses. The increase in expense was offset partially by business divestitures and expense efficiencies. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.4% at June 30, 2007 (es timated), 8.5% at March 31, 2007, and 8.5% at June 30, 2006.  During the quarter, $1.9 billion of common stock was repurchased, reflecting 36.7 million shares purchase d at an average price of $51.13 per share.  Headcount of 179,664 increased by 7,241 since June 30, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 Other financial information • Merger savings and cost : For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, approximately $730 million of merger savings have been realized, an annualized rate of $2.9 billion, which is in line with management’s target for the year. Management estimates that annualized savings will be approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007. Merger costs of $64 million were expensed during the second quarter of 2007, bringing the total amount of merger costs incurred to $3.6 billion (including capitalized costs) since the beginning of 2004. Management currently expects total me rger costs (including costs associ ated with The Bank of New York transaction) will be approximately $3.8 billion. The rema ining merger costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2007. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines of business’ results on a managed basis, which is a no n-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans record ed on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase re tains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; acco rdingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans a nd the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks associated with the loans report ed on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allo ws management to assess the compar ability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’ s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (second quarter of 2007) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
