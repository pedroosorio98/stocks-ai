Sincerely, &nbsp; &nbsp; Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer &nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Letter from the Board of Directors &nbsp; October 19, 2020 &nbsp; Dear Shareholder, &nbsp; This past fiscal year presented unprecedented societal and business challenges on a global scale. We mourn the losses COVID-19 has inflicted on so many individuals and families across the world. We&#146;re humbled and appreciative of the opportunities Microsoft has had to empower our customers and partners to meet the challenges they face and will continue our contributions to help the world respond to and eventually control COVID-19. Throughout the year, the Board and executive leadership of Microsoft collaborated closely to ensure the Company met its commitments to a broad range of stakeholders, including our employees, customers, the communities we operate in, suppliers, and of course our shareholders. &nbsp; This year also included necessary recognition and reckoning with global issues of racial justice in communities across the United States and around the world. The Board worked with Microsoft&#146;s senior leadership team and employees to reflect on, learn, and identify the role Microsoft must play in driving change. In June, the Company announced specific actions to address racial injustice and inequity for the Black and African American community in the U.S. These are focused on three multiyear, sustained efforts: increasing our representation and culture of inclusion, engaging our ecosystem, and strengthening our communities. We know this is not a one-time event and will require ongoing work and focus in the months and years ahead. This year also included significant new sustainability commitments by the Company, including the goal to be carbon negative by 2030. &nbsp; Amidst the challenges, fiscal year 2020 offered another record year for financial performance, and Microsoft delivered strong results for our shareholders, including a return of $35 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We look forward to more opportunity ahead as we remain committed to the long-term interests of our shareholders. In seeking shareholder perspectives, during fiscal year 2020, our Board Chair and members of management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning over 48% of Microsoft shares. Shareholder feedback helped inform the continued evolution of our executive compensation program towards more performance-based compensation and to further enhance transparency on compensation decisions and other topics. &nbsp; This year&#146;s Board nominees represent a wide range of backgrounds and expertise. We believe our diversity of experiences, perspectives, and skills contributes to the Board&#146;s effectiveness in managing risk and providing guidance that positions Microsoft for long-term success in a dynamically changing business environment. Of our 12 Board nominees, 11 are independent, which includes our Board Chair and all Committee members. This year, Co-Founder and Technology Advisor Bill Gates stepped down from the Company&#146;s Board of Directors to dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities. He continues to serve as Technology Advisor to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders in the Company. The Board has benefited from Bill&#146;s leadership and vision in innumerable ways over the years, and we are grateful for his contributions and insights. &nbsp; This Proxy Statement describes Microsoft&#146;s corporate governance policies and practices that foster the Board&#146;s effective oversight of the Company&#146;s business strategies and practices. We encourage you to view our ESG and Director Video Series to bring this information to life. The videos provide an opportunity for directors to discuss how we approach our roles and responsibilities and share the unique perspectives we bring to the Board, as well as of leaders from across Microsoft discussing our commitments to address key environmental and social challenges. The series is available at https://aka.ms/DirectorVideoSeries . &nbsp; As we look to the year ahead, we see tremendous possibilities for Microsoft to continue to help our customers and partners recover from the challenges of 2020 and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for the Company&#146;s business, shareholder value creation, and positive impacts at a global scale. We appreciate your investment in Microsoft and thank you for the trust you place in us and the opportunity to serve you and our Company as directors. Sincerely, &nbsp; Your Board of Directors &nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Notice&nbsp;of&nbsp;2020&nbsp;Annual&nbsp;Shareholders&nbsp;Meeting &nbsp; Date &nbsp; &nbsp; December&nbsp;2, 2020 Time &nbsp; &nbsp; 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time Virtual&nbsp;Meeting &nbsp; &nbsp; This year&#146;s meeting is a virtual shareholders meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MSFT20 Record&nbsp;Date &nbsp; &nbsp; October&nbsp;8, 2020.

Our adoption of leading governance practices fosters our sustained business success over the long term. Strong corporate governance, informed by participation from our shareholders, is essential to achieving our mission. During fiscal year 2020, independent members of our Board and members of management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning over 48% of our shares and provided shareholder feedback to the Board. &nbsp; 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Our Board believes that having a diverse mix of directors with complementary qualifications, expertise, and attributes is essential to meeting its oversight responsibility.

Governance and our Board of Directors &nbsp; &nbsp; Governance, Trust, and Resilience We believe that earning the trust of our customers, partners, shareholders, and other stakeholders is the foundation of our business success and is fundamental to realizing Microsoft&#146;s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Times of upheaval reveal the strength of that foundation, and the tumultuous events of 2020 have only underscored the importance of our approach. If we are meeting the standard to which we hold ourselves, we will&#151;even through periods of social and economic disruption&#151;build trust with our shareholders and other stakeholders, maintain the integrity of our operations, and help customers have the resilience to achieve their objectives. Responding to Coronavirus As the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, Microsoft responded quickly in service of our top priority: protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate.&nbsp;We&#146;re&nbsp;working to support these groups through continued pay for hourly service providers, extended parental leave, cash grants to local organizations, securing needed personal protective medical equipment, and more.&nbsp;We sought to empower our employees with regular, clear, and transparent communication from senior leadership that offers guidance on our global policies while providing the ability to follow the guidance of local government and health authorities in the communities where our employees reside. We also sought to help our customers use technology to ensure people can stay productive and connected with new tools and product features. Finally, we&#146;re helping the world&#146;s leaders and researchers in the fight against COVID-19. We dedicated $20 million of our AI for Health program to supporting COVID-19 efforts. This includes teaming up with the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop Microsoft&#146;s Healthcare Bot, and The Bill&nbsp;&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to fuel the CoVIg-19 Plasma Bot and CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance plasma donation recruitment website. The Call for Racial Justice As the U.S. and much of the world faced a wave of protests calling for racial justice, we worked to build on our past commitments and help push for greater impact by supporting inclusive economic opportunity. First, we committed to increasing our representation and culture of inclusion. We will build on our diversity and inclusion (&#147;D&amp;I&#148;) momentum from the past five years by adding an additional $150 million of D&amp;I investment, and will double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S. by 2025. We also committed to engaging our ecosystem. We will use our balance sheet and engagement with suppliers and partners to extend the vision for societal change throughout our ecosystem, creating new opportunities for them and the communities they serve. Finally, we committed to efforts that strengthen our communities. We will use the power of data, technology, and partnership to help address racial injustice in the lives of Black and African American citizens across the U.S., including to address the safety and well-being of our own employees in the communities in which they live. Our expanded Justice Reform Initiative seeks to protect fundamental rights and create a more equitable justice system by working with diverse stakeholders to advance reforms in policing, diversion, and prosecution. Our Board&#146;s Engagement Through these challenges and others, our management benefits from the thoughtful insights and oversight provided by our diverse mix of directors with complementary qualifications, expertise, and attributes. Throughout 2020, our Board of Directors and its committees maintained its regular schedule of quarterly meetings, quickly transitioning to virtual meetings using Microsoft Teams as COVID-19 emerged. The Board&#146;s longstanding work to provide oversight, review, and counsel related to long-term strategy, risks, and opportunities provided a strong foundation for management and the Board to build upon in responding quickly and appropriately to these and other unexpected global challenges and to seize new opportunities to serve our customers and fulfill our mission. &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Building Trust and Accountability Our shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, and other stakeholders are all increasingly focused on the importance of the effective engagement and action on environmental, social, and governance (&#147;ESG&#148;) topics. To meet the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders and to maintain their trust, we are committed to conducting our business in ways that are principled, transparent, and accountable. The foundation of these commitments is expressed in Microsoft&#146;s Standards of Business Conduct (&#147;Standards&#148;) at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines which apply to our employees, officers, Board of Directors, and our subsidiaries and controlled affiliates across the globe. These Standards require not only legal compliance, but also broader commitments to address accessibility, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and privacy. In support of these Standards, we strive to build a workplace culture that embraces learning and fosters trust&#151;a culture where every employee feels free to ask questions and raise concerns when something doesn&#146;t seem right. We extend our high expectations to suppliers who do business with Microsoft, requiring them to uphold the human rights, labor, health and safety, environmental, and business ethics practices prescribed in our Supplier Code of Conduct at https://aka.ms/scoc . In addition, we have made a broad range of environmental and social commitments. Some of our key commitments are highlighted on page 8 and many more are disclosed at www.microsoft.com/csr . We also aim to hold ourselves accountable by publicly reporting on our policies, practices, and performance to provide our stakeholders visibility into how we are meeting our commitments and responsibilities. Our Reports Hub available at www.microsoft.com/transparency provides a consolidated, comprehensive view of our ESG reporting and data ranging from our carbon footprint to workforce demographics to political donations. We work to align our ESG reporting to global standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards and sector-based materiality maps provided by the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board. In addition, we were among the first companies to align our human rights work with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to adopt the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Recognizing the interest of shareholders in establishing greater transparency about corporate political contributions, we disclose our political contributions to support candidates and ballot measures and how certain of our trade association membership dues are used for political activities. As part of our commitment to transparency, we developed the Principles and Policies for Guiding Microsoft&#146;s Participation in the Public Policy Process in the U.S., which focuses on ensuring compliance with applicable federal and state laws and goes beyond compliance to implement what we consider leading practices in corporate accountability, transparency, integrity, and responsibility. The policy is available at www.microsoft.com/public-policy-engagement . Overall, we believe that our commitment to strong corporate governance and effective board oversight plays a critical role in ensuring accountability, earning trust, and boosting our resilience in a turbulent world. Below we describe Microsoft&#146;s corporate governance policies and practices that foster effective board oversight in service of the long-term interests of our shareholders, explain the process for selecting director candidates, and present the 2020 nominees for election to our Board. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;7 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&nbsp;and&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;of&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Environmental&nbsp;and&nbsp;Social&nbsp;Topics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From our CEO and Senior Leadership Team (&#147;SLT&#148;) and throughout our organization, people at Microsoft are working to conduct our business in principled ways that make a significant positive impact on important global issues. Microsoft&#146;s Board of Directors provides insight, feedback, and oversight across a broad range of environmental and social matters. In particular, among the responsibilities of the Board&#146;s Regulatory and Public Policy Committee is to provide oversight and guidance to the Board and management about the Company&#146;s policies and programs that relate to corporate social responsibility. &nbsp; Here is how Microsoft is managing three topics that we know are of interest to many of our shareholders and other stakeholders. Deeper information across a wide range of ESG topics is available at www.microsoft.com/csr . &nbsp; Workplace and Culture &nbsp; Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing and diverse talent. To foster their and our joint success, we seek to create an environment where people can do their best work&#151;a place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, and where they know their needs can be met.&nbsp;We&#146;ve used the concept of a growth mindset to transform our culture. It starts with a belief that everyone can grow and develop; that potential is nurtured, not predetermined; and that anyone can change their mindset. We&#146;re also working to transform HR using data, technology, process excellence, and investing in our people. For instance, we&#146;ve sought to align our employee benefits to our culture, evolving them to be more holistic and inclusive. Over the past several years we&#146;ve sought to drive inclusive opportunity by providing increased transparency on our diversity and inclusion commitments and making progress in applying and advancing D&amp;I practices across our workplace, including a focus on allyship, behavior modeling, broadening our search for talent, and nurturing&nbsp;employee advocacy groups.&nbsp;See more at www.microsoft.com/diversity . &nbsp; Environmental Sustainability &nbsp; Microsoft&#146;s strategy for a sustainable future focuses on climate, ecosystems, water, and waste. On climate, this includes a commitment to becoming carbon negative across Microsoft operations and our supply chain by 2030, shifting to 100% renewable energy by 2025, and launching a Climate Innovation Fund to invest $1&nbsp;billion over the next four years in new technologies and innovative sustainability solutions. We also aim to be a leading provider of technology solutions for environmental challenges. In April 2020, we&nbsp;shared plans to create a &#147;Planetary Computer,&#148; which will aggregate environmental data from around the world and put it to work to help our partners and customers with environmental decision making in their organizational activities.&nbsp;We&#146;ve also committed to advocate for public policies that support carbon reduction and removal and ecosystem protection. See more on these and our latest commitments at www.microsoft.com/environment . &nbsp; Responsible AI &nbsp; Microsoft is committed to ensuring our artificial intelligence (&#147;AI&#148;) breakthroughs are developed responsibly, earn people&#146;s trust, and benefit society. Microsoft created our Office of Responsible AI (&#147;ORA&#148;) and a multidisciplinary internal AI, Ethics, and Effects in Engineering and Research Committee (&#147;AETHER&#148;), to establish an internal governance structure that provide principles, practices, tools, and compliance processes across the Company that help to ensure Microsoft is upholding its AI principles in its development of AI technology and products. ORA sets our rules and governance processes, working closely to enable teams across the Company, and AETHER advises our leadership on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI innovations. Together, ORA and AETHER work closely with our engineering and sales teams to help them uphold Microsoft&#146;s AI principles in their day-to-day work. We are active on the public policy front calling for laws and regulation on AI technologies like facial recognition to ensure that the promise of AI is realized for the benefit of society at large while protecting fundamental rights.

Our Board and its committees work closely with management to provide oversight, review, and counsel related to long-term strategy, risks, and opportunities, and feedback from shareholders. In particular, the Board oversees business affairs and integrity, works with management to determine our mission and long-term strategy, oversees risk management, performs the annual CEO evaluation, oversees CEO succession planning, and oversees internal controls over financial reporting and external audit. The Board looks to the expertise of its committees to provide strategic oversight in their areas of focus. Examples of oversight areas are provided below and further below we describe the Board&#146;s committee structure and each committee&#146;s areas of focus and oversight. Strategy Led by the CEO, the SLT develops and executes our business strategy. It manages our operations and works to model our desired culture, create innovative products, establish accountability, and control risk. The SLT also aligns our structure, operations, people, policies, and compliance efforts to our mission and strategy. Overseeing management&#146;s development and execution of the Company&#146;s strategy is one of our Board&#146;s primary responsibilities. The Board works closely with the SLT to respond to a dynamically changing business environment. The SLT and other leaders from across the Company provide business and strategy updates to our Board quarterly, and the Board participates in an annual strategy retreat with the SLT and other leaders. At meetings throughout the year, the Board also assesses the strategic alignment of the Company&#146;s budget and capital plan and strategic acquisition and integration process. For large acquisitions such as LinkedIn and GitHub, the Board engages management on a broad range of considerations, such as due diligence findings, valuation, and integration planning. Risk Effective risk management is critical to Microsoft&#146;s ability to achieve its mission. The Board oversees management in exercising its responsibility managing risk. With the Audit Committee, the Board assesses whether management has an appropriate framework to manage risks and whether that framework is operating effectively. On a regular basis, the Board and its committees engage with management on risk as part of broad strategic and operational discussions which encompass interrelated risks, as well as on a risk-by-risk basis. The Board executes its oversight responsibility directly and through its committees, who regularly report back to the Board. For information on specific areas of risk oversight, each committee has a charter describing its specific responsibilities which can be found on our website at https://aka.ms/boardcommittees . The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company and other risk areas not delegated to one of its committees. For example, the Board maintains direct oversight over cybersecurity risk. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity, security features of the products and services we provide our customers, and the results of security breach simulations. The Board also discusses recent incidents throughout the industry and the emerging threat landscape, in part identified through Microsoft&#146;s intelligent security graph. (For more information, see&nbsp; www.microsoft.com/security/intelligence-security-api) . We believe that the Board&#146;s leadership structure, including its independent chair, supermajority of independent directors, and allocation of oversight responsibilities to appropriate committees, provides effective board-level risk oversight. Culture, Workplace, and Succession Planning Our culture isn&#146;t what we talk or write about; it&#146;s what&#146;s we live every day. Our SLT holds itself accountable to modeling the culture we strive for. We focus on creating a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that allows our employees to build meaningful careers. Key to this environment is cultivating a growth mindset, where our workforce is focused on learning, listening, and growing. We have established a set of five &#147;People Priorities&#148; that ground our Human Resource strategy: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Talent that can change the world &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; An evolving culture embracing a growth mindset &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; An exceptional place to work &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Transformational leadership &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Empowering at scale &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;9 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each SLT member serves as a &#147;sponsor&#148; for one or more of the priorities and all are accountable to help achieve them. We consider employee input from our annual anonymous poll and other feedback channels in designing talent programs, rewards, and benefits, and building the overall employee experience. The Board and the Compensation Committee engage with the SLT and Human Resources executives across a broad range of human capital management topics including culture, succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, employee recruiting and retention, and diversity and inclusion. Additionally, each year the Compensation and Audit Committees evaluate management&#146;s annual assessment of risk related to our compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee also oversees our sales incentive programs through engagement with management&#146;s Sales Incentive Compensation Governance Committee. A primary responsibility of the Board is planning for CEO succession and overseeing identification and development of other members of the SLT. The Board and the Compensation Committee work with the CEO and our head of Human Resources to plan for succession. For the CEO, the succession plan covers identification of internal and external candidates, and development plans for internal candidates. The Board annually reviews the CEO succession plan. The criteria used to assess potential CEO candidates are formulated based on the Company&#146;s business strategies, and include strategic vision, leadership, and operational execution. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool of potential CEO candidates. The Board maintains an emergency succession contingency plan that is reviewed on an annual basis by the Board and Governance and Nominating Committee. The plan identifies roles and responsibilities of individuals who would act if an unforeseen event prevented the CEO from continuing to serve. The Compensation Committee reviews with the CEO and reports to the Board on development and succession plans for the SLT. The Board may review development and succession planning more frequently as it deems necessary or desirable. &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Governance Structure Framework We have developed a corporate governance framework designed to ensure our Board has the authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business operations and to make decisions independent of management. Our goal is to align the interests of directors, management, and shareholders, and comply with or exceed the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) and applicable laws and regulations. This framework establishes the practices our Board follows with respect to, among other things, Board composition and member selection, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, director compensation, CEO performance evaluation, management succession planning, and Board committees. The Board is committed to seeking opportunities for improvements on an ongoing basis. Each summer, the Board updates our corporate governance framework based on shareholder feedback, results from the annual shareholders meeting, the Board and committees&#146; self-assessments, governance best practices, and regulatory developments. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Corporate&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;Documents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Articles of Incorporation &#149;&#8194;Bylaws &#149;&#8194;Corporate Governance Guidelines &#149;&#8194;Director Independence Guidelines &#149;&#8194;Microsoft Finance Code of Professional Conduct &#149;&#8194;Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct &#149;&#8194;Audit&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;Charter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Responsibilities&nbsp;Calendar &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Compensation Committee Charter &#149;&#8194;Governance and Nominating Committee Charter &#149;&#8194;Regulatory and Public Policy Committee Charter &#149;&#8194;Executive Stock Ownership Policy &#149;&#8194;Executive Compensation Recovery Policy &#149;&#8194;Compensation Consultant Independence Standards These documents are available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Shareholder Rights Microsoft strives to implement best practices in shareholder rights and to ensure the Company and Board align with the long-term interests of shareholders. We have enhanced our corporate governance framework over time based on input from our Board, shareholders, and other governance experts. Shareholder rights include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Single class of shares with each share entitled to one vote &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Annual election of all directors (unclassified board) &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Majority voting standard for directors in uncontested elections &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Confidential voting policy &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Shareholders of 15% of outstanding shares have the right to call a special meeting &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Proxy access bylaw allows groups of up to 20 shareholders holding 3% of shares for at least three years to nominate up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater) for inclusion in the proxy statement and ballot for election at an annual shareholders meeting Other requirements that align Company and long-term interests of shareholders include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Significant stock ownership requirements for directors, executive officers, and other senior leaders &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Strong &#145;no-fault&#146; executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy that applies to executive officers, other senior leaders, and our chief accounting officer &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Strict hedging and pledging prohibitions against our directors and executive officers hedging their ownership of Microsoft stock, including by trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to Company equity or debt securities. Directors and executive officers are prohibited from purchasing Microsoft stock on margin, borrowing against Microsoft stock held in a margin account, or pledging Microsoft stock as collateral for a loan &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Board tenure policy that seeks to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for the Board&#146;s independent directors &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Public company board service limit of no more than three other public company boards for directors. Directors who are current CEOs should not serve on more than one other public company board &nbsp; Shareholder Engagement Effective corporate governance includes regular, constructive conversations with our shareholders to proactively seek shareholder insights and to answer shareholder inquiries. We maintain an active dialogue with shareholders to ensure we thoughtfully consider a diversity of perspectives on issues including strategy, business performance, risk, culture and workplace topics, compensation practices, and a broad range of ESG issues. As noted above, the Board updates our corporate governance framework each summer based on a number of inputs, including shareholder feedback. Our Office of the Corporate Secretary coordinates engagement with Investor Relations and provides a summary of all relevant feedback to our Board . In fiscal year 2020, our Board Chair and members of management engaged with a cross-section of shareholders owning 48% of Microsoft shares. In addition, throughout the year our Investor Relations group engages with our shareholders, frequently along with Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, our CEO, or Ms.&nbsp;Hood, our CFO. Building on our fiscal year 2020 outreach, we engaged investors representing 45% of outstanding shares in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. After assuming the Chair of the Compensation Committee, Ms.&nbsp;Peterson&nbsp;proactively sought shareholder feedback and together with&nbsp;our Independent Board Chair&nbsp;held conversations&nbsp;in the&nbsp;summer of 2020&nbsp;with&nbsp;investors representing&nbsp;over 22% of our shares outstanding. Over the summer, management engaged additional investors representing another 23% of our&nbsp;outstanding&nbsp;shares to discuss executive compensation and&nbsp;other ESG topics. To communicate broadly with our shareholders, we also seek to transparently share ESG information relevant to our shareholders through our Investor Relations website, our Annual Report, this Proxy Statement, our Reports Hub, and in posts on the Microsoft On the Issues blog. We are proud to have helped pioneer a director video series that gives shareholders and other stakeholders insight into the thinking of our Board members. The videos provide an opportunity for our directors to discuss how they approach their role and responsibilities and to provide a behind-the-scenes look into the boardroom. The series can be viewed on our website at https://aka.ms/DirectorVideoSeries . This year we supplemented the series with videos of leaders from across Microsoft discussing our commitments to address key environmental and social challenges. &nbsp; Annual Board and Committee Evaluation Process The Board is committed to a rigorous self-evaluation process. The Governance and Nominating Committee annually evaluates the performance of the Board. In fiscal year 2020, the evaluation included utilizing a third-party facilitator to seek feedback from each director, and the results were reported to and discussed with the Board. The report includes an assessment of the Board&#146;s compliance with the principles in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and identifies areas in which the Board could enhance its performance. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;11 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our evaluation process is designed to elicit feedback on the processes, structure, composition, and effectiveness of the Board. The evaluation results have led to changes to facilitate increased Board effectiveness, including the appropriate distribution of oversight responsibilities across the Board and its committees, the structure of executive sessions, enhancements to director onboarding and continuing education programs, and consideration of the quantity and depth of information included in meeting materials. In addition, each committee annually evaluates its performance and reports the results to the Board. In fiscal year 2020, a third-party facilitator conducted the evaluation of each committee, which included feedback from directors, as well as key members of management and consultants who regularly attend the meetings. Each committee&#146;s evaluation included an assessment of the committee&#146;s compliance with the principles in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and its charter, and identified areas in which the committee could enhance its performance. Results requiring additional review or consideration are discussed at subsequent Board and committee meetings. Director Attendance Each quarter, our Board holds two-day meetings. Committee meetings occur the first day before the Board meeting. Once a year, committee and Board meetings occur on the same day so that the evening and following day can be devoted to the Board&#146;s annual strategy retreat, which includes presentations and discussions with our SLT and other senior management about our long-term strategy. In addition to the quarterly meetings, typically there are other regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings and several special meetings each year. At each quarterly Board meeting, time is set aside for the independent directors to meet without management present. Our Board met seven times during fiscal year 2020. Each director nominee attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all fiscal year 2020 meetings of the Board and each committee on which he or she served. In fiscal year 2020, the Board and committees of the Board held a total of 31 meetings. The director nominees attended at least 95% of the combined total meetings of the full Board and the committees on which they were members in fiscal year 2020. Directors are expected to attend the annual shareholders meeting, if practicable. All directors attended the 2019 Annual Meeting. Director Orientation and Continuing Education Our orientation programs are designed to familiarize new directors with our businesses, strategies, and policies and assist new directors in developing Company and industry knowledge to optimize their service on the Board. Regular continuing education programs enhance the skills and knowledge directors use to perform their responsibilities. These programs may include internally developed programs, programs presented by third parties, or financial and administrative support to attend qualifying academic or other independent programs. Director Stock Ownership Policy To align the interests of our directors and shareholders, our directors are required to own Microsoft shares equal in value to at least three times the base annual retainer (cash and stock) payable to a director. Each director must retain 50% of all net shares (post-tax) from the retainer until reaching the minimum share ownership requirement. Stock deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors counts toward the minimum ownership requirement. Each of our directors complied with our stock ownership policy in fiscal year 2020. Derivatives Trading, Hedging, and Pledging Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to Microsoft equity or debt securities. They also are prohibited from purchasing Microsoft common stock on margin, borrowing against Microsoft common stock held in a margin account, or pledging Microsoft common stock as collateral for a loan. Employees, other than executive officers, are generally permitted to engage in transactions designed to hedge or offset market risk. &nbsp; &nbsp; 12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Board Independence The Board&#146;s independence enables it to be objective and critical in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our directors will be independent. The independent members of the Board annually appoint an independent Board Chair to facilitate the Board&#146;s oversight of management, promote communication between management and our Board, engage with shareholders, and lead consideration of key governance matters. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Elements&nbsp;of&nbsp;Board&nbsp;Independence&nbsp;at&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; 11 of 12 director nominees are independent &#150; We are committed to maintaining a substantial majority of directors who are independent of the Company and management. Except for our CEO, Satya Nadella, all director nominees are independent &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Board tenure &#150; We are committed to board refreshment. To strike a balance between retaining directors with deep knowledge of the Company and adding directors with a fresh perspective, the Board will seek to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. The current average tenure for our independent directors is 4.6 years &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Executive sessions of independent directors &#150; At each quarterly Board meeting, time is set aside for the independent directors to meet in executive session without management present. Additional executive sessions are held as needed &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Committee independence &#150; Only independent directors are members of the Board&#146;s committees.

Key responsibilities include: &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Calling meetings of the Board and independent directors &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Setting the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with other directors, the CEO, and the Corporate Secretary &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Chairing executive sessions and coordinating activities of the independent directors &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Leading the Board&#146;s annual CEO performance evaluation &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;When requested, representing the Board with internal and external audiences including shareholders &nbsp; Board Committees To support effective corporate governance, our Board delegates certain responsibilities to its committees, who report on their activities to the Board. These committees have the authority to engage legal counsel or other advisors or consultants as they deem appropriate to carry out their responsibilities. Our Board has an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee, and Regulatory and Public Policy Committee. In addition, in fiscal year 2020 our Regulatory and Public Policy Committee held joint meetings with both the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee on areas of complementary responsibility. The table below provides summary information about each director nominee followed by a summary of each committee&#146;s responsibilities. Each committee has a charter describing its specific responsibilities which can be found on our website at https://aka.ms/boardcommittees . &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;13 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Membership &nbsp; Director &nbsp;&nbsp; Audit &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;and Nominating &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory&nbsp;and Public Policy &nbsp; &nbsp; Reid G.

The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. &nbsp; The Board has determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and auditing matters to serve on the Audit Committee. All current members of the Audit Committee meet the Nasdaq listing standard of financial sophistication and three are &#147;audit committee financial experts&#148; under SEC rules. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Assist our Board in establishing the annual goals and objectives of the CEO &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Establish the process for annually reviewing the CEO&#146;s performance &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Recommend our CEO&#146;s compensation to the independent members of our Board for approval &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Approve annual compensation, and in consultation with the CEO oversee performance evaluations, for the non-CEO members of the SLT &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Review and discuss with the CEO and report to the Board development and corporate succession plans for the non-CEO members of the SLT &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Oversee administration of the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation and retirement plans &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Monitor and evaluate the compensation and benefits structure of Microsoft, as the Committee deems appropriate, including policies regarding SLT compensation &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Oversee and advise the Board and management about Company policies, programs, and initiatives for diversity and inclusion and human capital management &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Periodically review the compensation paid to non-employee directors and make recommendations to our Board for any adjustments &nbsp; Our senior executives for Human Resources support the Compensation Committee in its work. The Committee may delegate its authority to subcommittees and to one or more designated members of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to one or more executive officers the authority to make grants of equity-based compensation to eligible individuals who are not executive officers and to administer the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation plans. The Committee has delegated to senior management the authority to make stock award grants to employees who are not members of the SLT or Section&nbsp;16 officers and to administer the Company&#146;s equity-based compensation plans. &nbsp; Independent compensation consultant &#150; The Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation consultant throughout fiscal year 2020. For the first part of the year, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC served in this role, and effective as of March 9, 2020, they were succeeded by Pay Governance LLC. The consultant advises the Committee on marketplace trends in executive compensation, management proposals for compensation programs, and executive officer compensation decisions. The consultant also evaluates compensation for non-employee directors, the next levels of senior management, and equity compensation programs generally. The consultant discusses recommendations to the Board on CEO compensation with the Committee, and is directly accountable to the Committee. To maintain the independence of the consultant&#146;s advice, neither firm provides or provided services to Microsoft other than those described above. The Committee has adopted Compensation Consultant Independence Standards which can be viewed on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . These standards require that the Committee annually assess the independence of its compensation consultant. A consultant satisfying the following requirements will be considered independent. The consultant (including each individual employee of the consultant providing services): &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Is retained and terminated by, has its compensation fixed by, and reports solely to, the Compensation Committee &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Is independent of the Company &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Will not perform any work for Company management except at the request of the Compensation Committee Chair and in the capacity of the Committee&#146;s agent &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Should not provide any unrelated services or products to the Company and its affiliates or management, except for surveys purchased from the consultant&#146;s firm &nbsp; In assessing the consultant&#146;s independence, the Compensation Committee considers the nature and amount of work performed for the Committee during the year, the nature of any unrelated services performed for the Company, and the fees paid for those services in relation to the firm&#146;s total revenue.

In making its annual director nominations determination, the Board&#146;s objective is to recommend a group of directors that can best ensure the continuing success of our business and represent shareholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience and perspectives. The Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board director candidates for nomination and election during the annual shareholders meeting or for appointment to fill vacancies. The Committee works with our Board to determine the characteristics, skills, and experience for the Board as a whole and its individual members with the objective of having a board with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experience. In making its recommendations to our Board, the Committee considers the qualifications of individual director candidates applying the Board membership criteria described below. The Committee retains any search firm involved in identifying potential candidates and approves their fees. For all directors, we require an independent mindset, integrity, personal and professional ethics, business judgment, and the ability and willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board. Our Board considers many factors in evaluating the suitability of individual director candidates, including their general understanding of global business, sales and marketing, finance, and other disciplines relevant to the success of a large, publicly traded company; understanding of our business and technology; educational and professional background; personal accomplishment; and national, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. In all cases, a record of significant accomplishment in a relevant arena is a must. The Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which new candidates are selected. We work with our search firm to ensure the candidate slate provided to the Committee includes diverse candidates. The Board does not believe that directors should expect to be re-nominated annually. In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, the Committee considers the director&#146;s participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the results of the most recent Board evaluation, and meeting attendance. When the Committee recruits new director candidates, that process typically involves either a search firm or a member of the Committee contacting a prospect to assess interest and availability. A candidate will then meet with members of the Board and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, and then meet with members of management as appropriate. At the same time, the Committee and the search firm will contact references for the candidate. A background check is completed before a final candidate recommendation is made to the Board. Shareholders previously elected all Board nominees. The Committee assesses its efforts to maintain an effective and diverse board as part of its regular responsibilities, which include annually: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reporting to our Board on the performance and effectiveness of the Board &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Presenting to our Board individuals recommended for election to the Board during the annual meeting &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Assessing the Committee&#146;s own performance Shareholder Recommendations and Nominations of Director Candidates Recommendations The Governance and Nominating Committee considers shareholder recommendations for candidates for the Board of Directors using the same criteria described above. The name of any recommended candidate for director, together with a brief biographical sketch, a document indicating the candidate&#146;s willingness to serve if elected, and evidence of the nominating shareholder&#146;s ownership of Company stock must be sent to the attention of MSC 123/9999, Office of the Corporate Secretary, Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, 98052-6399. Nominations Our Bylaws provide for proxy access shareholder nominations of director candidates by eligible shareholders. A shareholder who wishes to formally nominate a candidate, whether for inclusion in the Company&#146;s proxy statement or not, must follow the procedures described in Article 1 of our Bylaws. Appropriately nominated proxy&nbsp;access candidates will be included in the Company&#146;s proxy statement and ballot. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;17 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Board Composition Our Board of Directors believes that having a diverse mix of directors with complementary qualifications, expertise, and attributes is essential to meeting its oversight responsibility. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Nominee&nbsp;Qualifications,&nbsp;Expertise,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Attributes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Board Diversity Representation of gender, ethnic, geographic, cultural, or other perspectives that expand the Board&#146;s understanding of the needs and viewpoints of our customers, partners, employees, governments, and other stakeholders worldwide. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Financial Leadership of a financial firm or management of the finance function of an enterprise, resulting in proficiency in complex financial management, capital allocation, and financial reporting processes. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Global Business Experience driving business success in markets around the world, with an understanding of diverse business environments, economic conditions, cultures, and regulatory frameworks, and a broad perspective on global market opportunities. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leadership Extended leadership experience for a significant enterprise, resulting in a practical understanding of organizations, processes, strategic planning, and risk management.

Communications relating to other topics, including those that are primarily commercial in nature, will not be forwarded. &nbsp; @&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; askboard@microsoft.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSC&nbsp;123/9999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Corporate&nbsp;Secretary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Corporation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Microsoft Way &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redmond, WA 98052-6399 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerns about accounting or auditing matters or possible violations of our Standards of Business Conduct should be reported under the procedures outlined in the Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct, which is available on our Microsoft integrity website at www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/integrity . Director Independence Guidelines Our Board has adopted director independence guidelines to assist in determining each director&#146;s independence. These guidelines are available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . The guidelines either meet or are more restrictive than the definition of &#147;independent director&#148; in the listing requirements of Nasdaq and applicable laws and regulations. The guidelines identify categories of relationships the Board has determined would not affect a director&#146;s independence and therefore are not considered by the Board in determining director independence. Following the director independence guidelines, each year and before a new director is appointed, the Board must affirmatively determine a director has no relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. Annually, each director completes a detailed questionnaire that provides information about relationships that might affect the determination of independence. Management provides the Governance and Nominating Committee and Board with relevant known facts and circumstances of any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee that is outside the categories permitted under the director independence guidelines. The Committee then completes an assessment of each director considering all known relevant facts and circumstances concerning any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee. This process includes evaluating whether any identified relationship otherwise adversely affects a director&#146;s independence and affirmatively determining that the director has no material relationship with Microsoft, another director, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with our Company. The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers the tenure of a director, and for longer serving directors, whether the duration of service impacts the director&#146;s independence from management, as demonstrated by the director&#146;s relationship with management and the director&#146;s participation in Board and committee deliberations. The Board seeks to maintain an average tenure of 10 years or less for its independent directors as a group. Based on the review and recommendation by the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board analyzed the independence of each director and nominee. The Board determined that Mses. List-Stoll, Peterson, Pritzker, Walmsley, and Warrior, and Messrs. Hoffman, Johnston, Scharf, Sorenson, Stanton, and Thompson (as well as Charles H. Noski and Helmut Panke, whose Board service ended on December 4, 2019) meet the standards of independence under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the director independence guidelines, and applicable NASDAQ listing standards, including that each member is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment. In making this determination, the Committee and Board considered ordinary course transactions between Microsoft and certain related entities, for instance the purchase of software licenses by companies of which a director is an executive officer, and purchases by Microsoft of goods and services from such companies.&nbsp;In reaching that conclusion with respect to Ms.&nbsp;Pritzker, the Committee and Board considered transactions between&nbsp;LinkedIn, a subsidiary of&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;and&nbsp;3Q Digital, Inc.,&nbsp;a digital marketing company&nbsp;(&#147;3Q&#148;), which accounted for more than 5% of&nbsp;3Q&#146;s annual revenue for its last completed&nbsp;fiscal year.&nbsp;3Q has provided digital marketing services for LinkedIn since 2015.&nbsp;In May 2019, trusts for the benefit of Ms.&nbsp;Pritzker&nbsp;and her family&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;an indirect&nbsp;majority interest in 3Q.&nbsp;In making its determination regarding Ms.&nbsp;Pritzker&#146;s independence, the Committee and Board noted that Ms. Pritzker&nbsp;is not a director or officer&nbsp;of, and holds no&nbsp;direct equity&nbsp;ownership interest in,&nbsp;3Q or any&nbsp;of its&nbsp;parent&nbsp;organizations. The Committee and Board further noted that Ms.&nbsp;Pritzker has recused herself from participation in any decisions related to 3Q or the Trusts&#146; investment therein and does not otherwise have the ability to control the&nbsp;Trusts&#146;&nbsp;investment or other decisions regarding&nbsp;3Q.&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Pritzker&nbsp;was not involved&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;negotiation of the&nbsp;commercial agreements between 3Q and LinkedIn. &nbsp; &nbsp; 26 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions We are a global company with extensive operations in the U.S. and many foreign countries. Every year, we spend billions of dollars for goods and services purchased from third parties. The authority of our employees to purchase goods and services is widely dispersed. Because of these wide-ranging activities, there may be transactions, business arrangements or relationships with businesses and other organizations in which one of our directors, executive officers, nominees for director, or an owner of 5% or more of our stock (&#147;5% shareholders&#148;) or their immediate families, may also be a director, executive officer, or investor, or have some other direct or indirect material interest (&#147;related entities&#148;). We will refer to these transactions with related entities as related-party transactions where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a director, executive officer, nominee for director or 5% shareholders, or immediate family member has a direct or indirect material interest. Related-party transactions have the potential to create actual or perceived conflicts of interest between Microsoft and its directors, executive officers, nominees for director or 5% shareholders, or their immediate family members. The Audit Committee has established a written policy and procedures for review and approval of related-party transactions. If a related-party transaction subject to review involves directly or indirectly a member of the Audit Committee (or an immediate family member or domestic partner), the remaining Committee members will conduct the review. In evaluating a related-party transaction, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The goods or services provided by or to the related party &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The nature of the transaction and the costs to be incurred by Microsoft or payments to Microsoft &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The benefits associated with the transaction and whether comparable or alternative goods or services are available to Microsoft from unrelated parties &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The business advantage Microsoft would gain by engaging in the transaction &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The significance of the transaction to Microsoft and to the related party &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Management&#146;s determination that the transaction is in the best interests of Microsoft To receive Audit Committee approval, a related-party transaction must have a Microsoft business purpose and be on terms that are fair and reasonable to Microsoft and be as favorable to Microsoft as would be available from non-related entities in comparable transactions. The Audit Committee also requires that the transaction meet the same Microsoft standards that apply to comparable transactions with unaffiliated entities. During fiscal year 2020, there were ordinary course transactions between Microsoft and certain related entities, for instance the purchase of software licenses by companies of which a director is an executive officer and purchases by Microsoft of goods and services from such companies. None of these transactions constituted a related-party transaction that required approval by the Audit Committee. &nbsp; &nbsp; Director Compensation The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the regular annual retainer paid to non-employee directors and makes recommendations for adjustments, as appropriate, to the Board. We have not increased director pay since fiscal year 2015. As our CEO, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella does not receive additional pay for serving as a director. Mr.&nbsp;Gates has waived his cash and stock awards. &nbsp; Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation Structure for Directors &nbsp; Regular Retainers (all directors except Messrs.

Directors may participate in our corporate matching gift program for charitable donations. Director retainers are paid quarterly in arrears. Quarterly periods are measured beginning with the annual meeting. At the end of each quarterly period, we pay 25% of the total annual retainer to each director. The number of shares awarded each quarterly period is determined by dividing the dollar value of the stock award by the market price of our common stock as of the last business day of the period. Retainers are pro-rated for directors who join or leave the Board or have a change in Board role during a quarterly period. Directors may elect to defer and convert to deferred stock awards all or part of their annual cash retainer, and to defer receipt of all or part of their annual stock awards retainer under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Amounts deferred are maintained in bookkeeping accounts that are deemed invested in Microsoft common stock, and dividends paid on deemed investments are also deemed to be invested in our common stock. We calculate the number of shares credited by dividing the amount deferred by the closing market price of our common stock on the originally scheduled payment date. Accounts in the plan are distributed in shares of Microsoft common stock, with payments either in installments beginning on separation from Board service or in a lump sum paid no later than the fifth anniversary after separation from Board service. Director Compensation This table describes the cash and stock award portions of the annual retainer paid to each non-employee director who served in fiscal year 2020. Mr.&nbsp;Nadella received no compensation as a director. He is excluded from the table because we fully describe his compensation in Part 2 &#150; Named Executive Officer Compensation. &nbsp; Name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fees&nbsp;Earned&nbsp;or Paid&nbsp;in&nbsp;Cash&sup1; ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Stock&nbsp;Awards&sup2; ($) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; All Other Compensation 3 ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Total ($) &nbsp; William H.

Our diverse portfolio, durable business models, and integrated, modern technology stack, powered by cloud and AI and underpinned by a clear focus on security and compliance, uniquely positioned us for continued progress during the past year. In this dynamic environment, we remain committed to meeting customer needs and helping organizations digitally transform, while ensuring our employees are well positioned to work effectively in an evolving landscape. Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve strong alignment between our long-term strategic goals and our shareholders&#146; interests, while providing a competitive total pay opportunity to attract and retain the key executives who drive our business. We are committed to continually reviewing our compensation program to ensure it is grounded in our pay-for-performance philosophy. Our Company continued with its active shareholder engagement program over the course of fiscal year 2020 and into early fiscal 2021. This involved discussions with investors representing nearly half of our shares outstanding. Throughout these conversations, many of which included participation from our Compensation Committee Chair and Independent Board Chair, we heard our shareholders&#146; perspectives on our compensation structure and disclosure. We carefully considered the feedback provided by our shareholders as our Committee made changes to our 2021 compensation program. We made a number of enhancements to our 2021 compensation program to further increase pay-for-performance alignment and respond directly to shareholder feedback. Our changes included the following: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Increased the weighting of the financial metrics portion of the CEO&#146;s annual cash incentive from 50% to 70% &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Increased the performance-based portion of our CEO&#146;s equity awards from 50% to 70% &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Revised the TSR modifier to our Performance Stock Awards (&#147;PSAs&#148;) to provide for a reduction in payout for all PSA recipients, if relative TSR falls below the 40th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Increased the disclosure of the goal-setting process and results under our PSAs Our Committee believes that these enhancements build on our efforts to thoughtfully align the interests of our shareholders and incentivize growth in the long-term. We appreciate your support and welcome your feedback on our compensation program reflected in the following pages and look forward to continued dialogue in the future. Sincerely, The Compensation Committee Sandra E. Peterson (Chair) Charles W. Scharf Emma N.

The Company&#146;s current executive compensation program has been structured to align with the business strategy that has been defined by the Board and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, and each year the Compensation Committee reviews the existing incentive structure, taking into consideration investor feedback, business performance, and our strategic roadmap, in considering the efficacy of further enhancements. &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;1 &#150; Performance Update Navigating Disruption Fiscal year 2020 began with the opportunity to build on the momentum of our record-setting 2019 performance. It ended in the turmoil of a global pandemic and economic crisis, and widespread civil unrest in the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;). Despite these unexpected and unprecedented events, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella and Microsoft&#146;s executive team led the Company to another year of historic financial performance, while successfully adapting to radically changing circumstances and demonstrating the transformation and resilience that we aspire to enable in our customers and ecosystem. Responding to the pandemic involved both maintaining the reliability of our own operations and accelerating our customers&#146; digital transformations. We took action early to enable remote work and adopt other measures to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and ensure the continuity of our operations. We built on our capabilities with our own productivity and business intelligence tools and devoted significant resources to ensure our employees and key customers such as government agencies, schools, medical facilities, and other frontline responders had virtual collaboration and other digital tools, and associated support, to optimize their effectiveness. An example of the impact we achieved is that in a single day in April, we enabled more than 200&nbsp;million Microsoft Teams meeting participants generating more than 4.1&nbsp;billion meeting minutes. We focused on our cloud operations to ensure their security and availability. We worked with customers and partners as they adapted to remote work and other business requirements that changed at an unprecedented pace. These efforts yielded years of transformative progress in months of time. As Mr.&nbsp;Nadella has stated, the disruptions of 2020 created a collective responsibility and opportunity to define what comes next: what to rebuild, what to reimagine, and what to leave behind. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, and new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. It is not a coincidence that Microsoft is uniquely positioned to adapt and help its customers answer these questions and thrive in this new environment.

Microsoft&#146;s performance in 2020 highlights the critical value of the Company&#146;s established long-term strategic direction allowing the Company to continue forward on its mission &#147;to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.&#148; Achieving Strong Financial Results Through all these changes, adaptations, and initiatives, Microsoft retained its focus on business execution.

The economic and social disruption provided the opportunity to our executive leadership to reflect and act concretely upon the modern corporation&#146;s purpose. Mr.&nbsp;Nadella articulated this purpose as the creation of profitable solutions to the challenges of people and planet in every community in every country around the world. We announced multiple initiatives and investments in fiscal year 2020. Our digital skills program aims to expand access to the technical capabilities needed in the modern workplace and into the future, particularly for those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities. We are taking concrete action to address racial injustice and inequity by improving the experience of Blacks and African Americans at Microsoft, by working to increase diversity among our suppliers and partners, and by strengthening our communities through the power of data, technology, and partnership. We also increased resources to our Justice Reform Initiative to address racial inequities in the criminal justice system. In 2020 we redoubled our commitment to sustainability by making available $1&nbsp;billion to invest in innovative climate solutions, and by setting a goal to be carbon negative by 2030. To advance trust, our organizations that promote the responsible use of artificial intelligence deepened their engagement with both our internal engineering groups to embed responsible practices into our products, and with external regulators and stakeholders to advocate for regulations that enable technologies such as AI and facial recognition to benefit society at large. These programs reflect the growing momentum of our social and environmental commitments, which continue to accelerate despite the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the encouragement and guidance of the Board, we have built concrete and ambitious commitments for these programs to ensure progress and accountability. Success in fiscal year 2020 required &#150; more urgently than almost any other year &#150; intense focus on business operations, agility to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances, strategic vision and excellence, and advancement of a world view that embraces challenges bigger than the Company, some that linger from our past and others that loom in our future. Mr.&nbsp;Nadella and his senior leadership team&#146;s success in rising to these challenges supports compensation decisions made for fiscal year 2020 performance. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;33 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;2 &#150; Executive Compensation Program Enhancements Shareholder Engagement &nbsp; Our executive compensation program is grounded in a compensation philosophy aimed at achieving strong alignment between our long-term strategic goals and our shareholders&#146; interests. Feedback received from our shareholders through ongoing engagement discussions informs our Compensation Committee&#146;s deliberations as it reviews the incentive structures in place on an ongoing basis. &nbsp; Our Board and our Compensation Committee deeply value the continued interest of and feedback from our shareholders on our executive compensation program and are committed to maintaining an active dialogue with them to ensure their perspectives are thoughtfully taken into account. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholder&nbsp;Engagement&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Engaged with shareholders owning 48% of shares in FY20 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#147;Virtual Shareholder Listening Tour&#148; in the first quarter of FY21 with new Compensation Committee Chair and Board Chair &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We carefully consider both the level of voting support from our shareholders on our say-on-pay vote, as well as comments from shareholders, when evaluating our executive compensation program. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, 77% of the votes cast supported our advisory resolution on the compensation of our Named Executives (&#147;say-on-pay&#148; vote). As in prior years, in fiscal year 2020 we continued our active shareholder engagement program, discussing compensation and a broad range of ESG issues with shareholders representing a total of 48% of our shares outstanding. For fiscal year 2021, we expanded our scope of shareholder outreach to obtain specific feedback on executive compensation program related matters. After assuming the Chair of the Compensation Committee, Ms.&nbsp;Peterson proactively sought shareholder feedback and together with our Independent Board Chair held conversations in the summer of 2020 with shareholders representing over 22% of our shares outstanding. Over the summer, management engaged additional shareholders representing another 23% of our outstanding shares to discuss executive compensation and other ESG topics. Enhancements to Compensation Program In discussing our compensation program throughout 2020 with investors, several key themes emerged in shareholders&#146; feedback. The Compensation Committee evaluated these themes and implemented enhancements to our fiscal year 2021 compensation program that both respond directly to shareholder input and further increase pay-for-performance alignment at Microsoft. Shareholder feedback and responsive actions taken include: &nbsp; Feedback Themes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Actions Taken &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Increase the performance-based component of the annual cash incentive &#150; to further strengthen our CEO&#146;s accountability to achieving results on the objective financial metrics that most closely align with our business strategy &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Shift the mix of our CEO&#146;s equity award to be majority performance-based &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Include a downside adjustment on the PSA payout, so that the TSR multiplier provides both upside and downside exposure for executives &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Investors would benefit from additional disclosure regarding the Compensation Committee&#146;s process to determine incentive compensation results &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Increased the weighting of the financial performance portion of the CEO&#146;s annual cash incentive from 50% to 70% for fiscal year 2021, split evenly between Incentive Plan Revenue (35%) and Incentive Plan Operating Income (35%) &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Increased the performance-based portion of our CEO&#146;s equity awards from 50% to 70% for fiscal 2021 &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Revised the relative TSR modifier for fiscal year 2021 PSAs to include a downside adjustment on PSA payout if relative TSR falls below the 40th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;3 &#150; Pay Setting Our Compensation Committee establishes the design of our executive compensation program. After considering Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s recommendations, the Compensation Committee also approves the annual target compensation (base salaries, target cash incentives, and equity incentive compensation) for our Named Executives, except Mr.&nbsp;Nadella. After considering the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the independent members of our Board approve Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s base salary, target cash incentive, regular stock awards, and target performance stock award. Our Compensation Committee also retains, and seeks the advice of, Pay Governance, an executive compensation consulting firm that is independent of management. See Part 1 - Governance and our Board of Directors - Board Committees for more information on Pay Governance&#146;s role and independence as an advisor to the Committee. Executive Compensation Philosophy We design our executive officer compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain the key executives who drive our success and industry leadership while considering individual and Company performance and alignment with the long-term interests of our shareholders. We achieve our objectives through a compensation program that: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Provides a competitive total pay opportunity &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Emphasizes pay for performance by delivering a majority of our executives&#146; pay through performance-based incentives &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Provides strong alignment with our shareholders, with at least 70% of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives delivered in the form of equity awards &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Focuses on the long-term through equity awards with multi-year vesting or performance requirements &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk-taking, assisted by our stock ownership requirements and executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy Competitive Pay We compete for senior executive talent with global information technology companies, large market capitalization U.S. companies, and smaller, high-growth technology businesses, depending on the role. The technology labor market is hyper-competitive with demand growing faster than the supply of technical talent, resulting in significant increases in compensation at the companies with whom we compete for this talent. The same conditions exist in the market for executive-level talent that can provide innovative leadership while managing at a global scale across several complex businesses. We expect these trends to continue and will adjust our approach to executive compensation to respond to evolving market conditions. Our Compensation Peer Group To ensure that our Board and Compensation Committee have current information to set appropriate compensation levels, we conduct an executive compensation market analysis each year that draws from third-party compensation surveys and publicly available data for a group of peer companies. We supplement this analysis with additional market information specific to each executive officer&#146;s role and responsibilities, including information gleaned from our experience recruiting for executive positions at Microsoft. While this market analysis and supplemental data inform the decisions of the independent Board members and our Compensation Committee on the range of compensation opportunities, we do not tie executive officer compensation to specific market percentiles. Because other companies actively recruit our executive officers to fill CEO and other senior leadership positions, we supplement market information with data on external opportunities potentially available to our executive officers. We also consider the relationship of annual target compensation among internal peers. In addition, our Committee is provided with an overview of compensation for our non-executive Microsoft employees and how this compensation relates to Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s compensation. &nbsp; &nbsp; 36 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In setting our fiscal year 2020 executive compensation design and compensation levels, we considered pay practices at the largest technology and general industry companies that were selected after review of three primary screening criteria: market capitalization, revenue, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;). Our Compensation Committee selected this peer group because it believed these companies are led by executives with similarly complex roles and responsibilities. The Committee also screened these companies to ensure they had a significant presence outside the U.S. and excluded companies in the financial services sector because of the different regulatory environment in which they operate. For fiscal year 2020, this compensation peer group comprised these companies: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer&nbsp;Group&nbsp;Used&nbsp;for&nbsp;Fiscal&nbsp;Year&nbsp;2020&nbsp;Pay&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1) &nbsp; Primary Peer Group of bellwether technology companies, which reflect Microsoft&#146;s more direct competitors for executive talent &nbsp; 2) &nbsp; Secondary Peer Group of &#147;large cap&#148; general industry companies, which reflect the complexities of operating large, global, innovative businesses and Microsoft&#146;s broader competition for executive talent The companies in the fiscal 2021 peer group are: &nbsp;&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;Peer&nbsp;Group&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;Technology &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Adobe &nbsp;&nbsp;Alphabet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon Apple &nbsp;

Verizon Performance-Based Pay and Goal Setting Our incentive compensation arrangements are tied to specific performance measures that drive long-term performance and value creation. For fiscal year 2020: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 56% of our Named Executives&#146; annual target compensation opportunity was performance-based, on average &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 50% of our Named Executives&#146; annual cash incentive was tied to achieving pre-established financial targets &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; 50% of our Named Executives&#146; annual target equity opportunity was delivered in the form&nbsp;of a performance-based stock award with payouts based on achievement against pre-established strategic objectives &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Management and the Compensation Committee discussed in detail the metrics that determine performance stock awards to ensure they are leading indicators that will drive long-term performance and value creation &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Performance stock awards included a relative TSR multiplier&nbsp;to reward significant positive outperformance, thereby strengthening the alignment of the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders As described above, in response to investor feedback, for fiscal year 2021 we are increasing the proportion of our CEO pay that is weighted toward objective, financial performance goals, with 70% of the annual cash incentive tied to pre-established financial metrics and 70% of the equity award in the form of PSAs. In addition, for all of our executive officers, in fiscal year 2021 we have added a downward adjustment to the relative TSR modifier so that payouts will be reduced for TSR performance below the 40 th percentile of the S&amp;P 500. The Compensation Committee sets cash incentive and PSA metric targets at the levels established, after review and engagement by the Board, for internal budgeting purposes. These targets are intended to be challenging but achievable. The Committee then determines thresholds, maximums, and interim payout levels after considering historical data, upside/downside scenarios, analytics, and year-over-year growth comparisons, to ensure rigorous alignment of payouts to performance. Where we have strong historical data, as with the Revenue and Operating Income measures used to determine 50% of the annual cash incentive (70% for the CEO in fiscal year 2021), we set thresholds at an estimated 90% probability of payout, and maximums at an estimated 20% probability of payout. Where we do not have strong historical data that will allow for probability estimates, as is the case with our more recently developed PSA metrics, we set thresholds that we believe are reasonably achievable and maximums that we believe can be reached only with exceptional performance. The Committee actively reviews the appropriateness of payout thresholds and maximums for each metric. The Committee focuses on ensuring that our challenging goals, when achieved, will result in shareholder value creation and, historically, our performance on these challenging goals has led to substantial returns to our shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; 38 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pay Mix At least 70% of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executives is equity-based to incentivize a long-term focus and align their interests with those of our shareholders. Our Compensation Committee structures the pay mix for our annual target total compensation opportunities to place a higher proportion in equity awards than the companies in our compensation peer group. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay&nbsp;Mix&nbsp;Versus&nbsp;Peers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Percentages derived by comparing the fiscal year 2020 target compensation levels for our Named Executives to the average of these amounts for the named executive officers of our compensation peer group companies using data available in mid-2019 when our Compensation Committee conducted our fiscal year 2020 compensation planning. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp;Best&nbsp;Practices &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; What We Do &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; What We Don&#146;t Do &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Maintain a stock ownership policy that reinforces the alignment of executive officer and shareholder interests (including stock ownership of 15x base salary for the CEO) &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Have a strong executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy to ensure accountability &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Promote long-term focus through multi-year vesting and performance requirements &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Prohibit pledging, hedging, and trading in derivatives of Microsoft securities &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;Retain an independent compensation consultant &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201; Solicit investor feedback on our compensation program and potential enhancements through an extensive shareholder engagement program &nbsp;&nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No excessive perquisites (e.g., no executive-only club memberships or medical benefits), and no tax gross-ups &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No employment agreements &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No change in control benefits &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No executive-only retirement programs &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No guaranteed bonuses &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No dividends paid on unvested stock awards &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;&#8201;No encouragement of unnecessary and excessive risk taking &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;39 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;4 &#150; Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation Program Design Consistent with our philosophy, the compensation program for our Named Executives in fiscal year 2020 consisted of an annual base salary plus annual cash and equity incentives awarded under our Executive Incentive Plan (&#147;Incentive Plan&#148;). Annual cash incentives were performance-based, with 50% determined formulaically based on achievement against pre-established financial targets and 50% determined based on operational performance in three weighted performance categories. As noted above in the section titled Enhancements to Compensation Program, for fiscal year 2021, in response to investor feedback 70% of our CEO&#146;s annual cash incentive will be determined based on formulaic achievement against pre-established financial targets and 30% will be determined based on operational performance in three weighted performance categories. The Compensation Committee believes this will strengthen the CEO&#146;s accountability to achieving results on the objective financial metrics that most closely align with our business strategy. Equity incentives under the Incentive Plan were allocated 50% to target performance stock awards (&#147;PSAs&#148;) and 50% to stock awards with four-year vesting (&#147;SAs&#148;). The Compensation Committee and the independent Board members believed the 50/50 balance between PSAs and SAs appropriately supported our long-term business goals and long-term retention incentives for our Named Executives. As noted above, in response to investor feedback, for fiscal year 2021 our CEO will receive 70% of his stock awards as PSAs. The Compensation Committee believes this will strengthen the alignment of pay and performance for our CEO. Base Salaries Our Named Executives&#146; base salaries align with the scope and complexity of their roles, their capabilities, and with prevailing market conditions. Annual Cash Incentives Cash incentives are determined in two performance categories, as follows. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &#147;Incentive Plan Revenue&#148; and &#147;Incentive Plan Operating Income&#148; are non-GAAP financial measures defined on pages 43-44. Financial We include financial results in our cash incentive to measure our success in meeting internal annual financial performance goals for revenue and profitability that we believe drive long-term value creation. For fiscal year 2020, the financial formulaic portion of the annual cash incentives were determined based on meeting pre-established performance targets for Incentive Plan Revenue and Incentive Plan Operating Income. The fiscal year 2020 Incentive Plan Revenue and Incentive Plan Operating Income performance targets were based on meeting the Company&#146;s internal fiscal year 2020 operating budget and were higher than our fiscal year 2019 actual performance for both metrics, further reflecting appropriately ambitious performance goals. &nbsp; &nbsp; 40 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Operational Assessment The operational assessment portion of each Named Executive&#146;s fiscal year 2020 annual cash incentives was determined based on assessment of individual performance against financial, operational, and strategic indicators in three performance categories. The performance indicators varied based on the Named Executive&#146;s responsibilities and the function or group he or she leads, and may have included (in alphabetical order in each category): &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Stakeholders&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Organizational&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Efficiency and productivity &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Innovation &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Product development and implementation of strategic roadmap &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Quality &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Revenue,&nbsp;consumption,&nbsp;and market share &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Customer and partner engagement and outreach &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Customer satisfaction &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Developer engagement &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Progress on Environmental, Social, and Governance goals &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Compliance and integrity &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Culture &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Diversity and inclusion &nbsp; &#149;&#8194; &nbsp; Organizational health &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board also considered: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Input from Microsoft&#146;s senior executives about Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s leadership &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The scorecard we use to measure performance against Microsoft&#146;s annual business plan &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s evaluation of Microsoft&#146;s and his individual performance over the past fiscal year Equity Compensation Under the Incentive Plan, each year our Named Executives receive both PSAs and SAs. Performance Stock Awards PSAs are designed to encourage our executives to achieve strong goals in key performance metrics selected to drive long-term performance and value creation. Due to the dynamic nature of our business and the specificity in the performance metrics that are chosen under our PSA program, we believe that measuring performance annually over our three-year performance period and modifying awards based on our three-year relative TSR results provides the most accurate assessment of our Company&#146;s long-term trajectory and performance achievements. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;41 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fiscal Year&nbsp;2020 Performance Stock Award Metrics and Weights Fiscal year 2020 PSA metrics are strategic measures that drive long-term performance and value creation.

No Other Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation During fiscal year 2020, no other compensation was awarded to our Named Executives. &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;5 &#150; Fiscal Year 2020 Compensation Decisions Our Named Executives were awarded the following compensation in fiscal year 2020: Fiscal Year 2020 Base Salaries We did not increase our Named Executives&#146; base salaries in fiscal year 2020. We believe our Named Executives&#146; salary levels continue to be appropriate and reasonable given their roles, capabilities, and experience. Fiscal Year 2020 Cash Incentive Awards We did not increase our target percentages for cash incentive awards in fiscal year 2020, which are measured as a percentage of base salary for fiscal year 2020, which were: Satya Nadella &#150; 300%; Amy Hood &#150; 250%; Jean-Philippe Courtois &#150; 225%; Margaret Johnson &#150; 200%; and Bradford Smith &#150; 250%. Our Compensation Committee and, for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board, determined the fiscal year 2020 cash incentive awards. These were based on two performance categories: financial results and operational performance results. Final results under each portion of the cash incentive, and the resulting awards, were as follows: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Nadella &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hood &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courtois &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson 1 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith &nbsp; Financial results (50%) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.46% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.46% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.46% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.46% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.46% &nbsp; Operational results (50%) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.66% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 160.00% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 150.00% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100.00% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 160.00% &nbsp; Total FY20 cash incentive (% of target) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 146.56% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 153.23% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 148.23% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 123.23% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 153.23% &nbsp; Total FY20 cash incentive ($) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $10,992,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $3,734,981 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $2,591,432 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $1,762,189 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $3,294,445 &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Ms. Johnson resigned her position as an executive officer of the Company effective July 1, 2020. Financial Results We achieved greater than target performance on the fiscal year 2020 financial performance measures shown below, notwithstanding the challenges of COVID-19, resulting in a weighted payout of 146.46%. Our FY20 target for Incentive Plan Revenue was over 110% of our FY19 actual result, and we achieved 101% of this target in FY20. Our FY20 target for Incentive Plan Operating Income was over 110% of our FY19 actual results, and we achieved 109% of this target in FY20. &nbsp; Financial Results (50% weight) ($ in billions) &nbsp;&nbsp; FY19 Actual &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FY20 Threshold &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FY20 Target &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FY20 Maximum &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FY20 Actual &nbsp; FY20 Incentive Plan Revenue &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $135.25 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $141.70 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $149.01 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $155.58 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $150.14 &nbsp; FY20 Incentive Plan Operating Income &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $44.29 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $45.05 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $48.71 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $54.56 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $53.14 &nbsp; &#147;Incentive Plan Revenue&#148; and &#147;Incentive Plan Operating Income&#148; are non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate Incentive Plan Revenue by adjusting GAAP Revenue for (1)&nbsp;the net impact of revenue deferrals, (2)&nbsp;credits and incentives, and (3)&nbsp;the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate Incentive Plan Operating Income by adjusting GAAP Operating Income for the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on a &#147;constant dollar&#148; basis by converting current period non-GAAP (i.e., adjusted for the items in the preceding two sentences) results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant exchange rates, which are determined at the outset of the current &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;43 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. These Incentive Plan financial metrics differ from the non-GAAP financial results we report in our quarterly earnings release materials. They should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. &nbsp; Operational Results &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp; The key results influencing the Compensation Committee and independent Board members&#146; decisions on the operational performance portion of Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s cash incentive are set forth below. Results are out of a possible 200% in each category. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighted&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Categories&nbsp;-&nbsp;Satya&nbsp;Nadella&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 Product &amp; Strategy (33.3% weight) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 130% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During fiscal year 2020, Microsoft increased revenue by 14% year over year, while facing unprecedented constraints due to COVID-19 in the second half of the year. Under Mr. Nadella&#146;s leadership during 2020, many of Microsoft&#146;s products achieved significant growth, especially in the commercial cloud business, where revenue increased 36% to $51.7&nbsp;billion. Other notable results included GitHub registered developers exceeding 50 million and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions surpassing 10 million. While Microsoft is constantly striving to lead across our product categories, there is more work to do in driving solutions that will get Microsoft to market faster. &nbsp; Mr. Nadella led Microsoft&#146;s acceleration of the optimization of many products and capabilities in 2020. He directed the management team to lean forward and intentionally build integral skills that became necessary in the face of the year&#146;s challenges, including enabling deeper capabilities for businesses to quickly and securely transition to remote work. His focus areas included our Azure cloud to make it easier for customers to harness data through the cloud, leverage artificial intelligence, and embrace the internet of things, as more work is required to be done at a distance; democratizing data transparency and the ability to enhance business processes; and ensuring security and privacy of proprietary data at a time where data origin is becoming more important to the global commerce landscape. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 Customers &amp; Stakeholders (33.3% weight) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 150% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Nadella embraced the idea that Microsoft&#146;s purpose is to create profitable solutions to the challenges of people and planet in every community in every country around the world. MSFT (TSR +52%) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (up 5% in fiscal year 2020) and the NASDAQ (up 24% in fiscal year 2020). The Board views his strong leadership of the Company&#146;s actions in response to the unique challenges of 2020 as unparalleled. Under Mr. Nadella&#146;s leadership, Microsoft continued its work to strengthen communities throughout the world through the power of data, technology, and partnership. Mr. Nadella focused the Company on driving global impact in privacy legislation, Responsible AI standards, and Digital Safety in order to help public institutions around the world deal with the growing concerns facing them at this unique time. &nbsp; Mr. Nadella led Microsoft&#146;s transformation in response to COVID-19, including devoting technology and resources to ensure customers, such as government agencies, schools, medical facilities, and other front-line responders, had the virtual collaboration and other digital tools to successfully navigate the unprecedented challenges of 2020. This critical leadership motivated the teams within Microsoft to lean in even more to help customers. Mr. Nadella also guided the Company to pioneer new technology solutions to business challenges caused by the pandemic and offer them to customers to use as they navigate similar issues. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 44 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 Culture&nbsp;&amp; Organizational Leadership (33.3% weight) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160% &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Board asked Mr. Nadella to create additional focus on the culture of the organization for fiscal year 2020 and is very pleased with the results that were achieved. Employee sentiment for Microsoft continues to be strongly positive. Based on poll data, 95% of employees feel proud to work at Microsoft. The Board credits Mr. Nadella for his tremendous progress driving cultural change across the organization, especially given the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on our business and our people. &nbsp; Under Mr. Nadella&#146;s leadership, Microsoft acted early to enable secure, remote work and adopt other measures to protect the health and well-being of our workforce, while ensuring the continuity of our operations for the many organizations that rely on Microsoft products and services to serve their customers or citizens. &nbsp; Mr. Nadella has enthusiastically fostered a culture of stewardship. During 2020, Microsoft redoubled its commitment to sustainability by making available $1 billion to invest in innovative climate solutions and by setting an ambitious goal to be carbon negative by 2030. Microsoft also took concrete actions to address racial injustice and inequity by improving the experience of Blacks and African Americans at Microsoft, by working to increase diversity among our suppliers and partners, and by strengthening our communities through the power of data, technology, and partnership. In fiscal year 2020, 91% of employees said Microsoft creates an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed. Microsoft also increased resources to our Justice Reform Initiative to address racial inequities in the criminal justice system. Demonstrating strong foresight for how the economy will recover, Mr. Nadella led Microsoft to announce a global skills initiative aimed at bringing digital skills to 25 million people worldwide by the end of 2020. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Other Named Executives The key results influencing the Compensation Committee&#146;s decisions on the operational performance category portion of the cash incentive for the other Named Executives are summarized below. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Key&nbsp;Results Amy E.

Fiscal Year 2018 PSAs (Completed Performance Period) Our Compensation Committee (and for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board) granted PSAs in fiscal year 2018 that pay out based on specific pre-established, performance goals and strategic performance objectives tied to creating long-term shareholder value. Performance was measured over the three-fiscal year performance period ending June&nbsp;30, 2020.

Year over year growth rates are calculated using constant dollars. &nbsp; When achieved, these challenging goals have resulted in substantial shareholder value creation. &#147;Commercial Cloud Revenue&#148; and &#147;Surface Revenue&#148;, when used as PSA metrics in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis are non-GAAP financial measures, calculated by adjusting GAAP results for these metrics (as defined in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020) for the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on a &#147;constant dollar&#148; basis by converting current period non-GAAP results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant exchange rates, which are determined at the outset of the fiscal year, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. These metric results differ from certain non-GAAP financial results we report in our quarterly earnings release materials; they should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Relative TSR Multiplier The core metric results for the fiscal year 2018 PSAs were then subject to adjustment based on the relative TSR performance multiplier, which compares our TSR for the three-fiscal year performance period to the TSR of the S&amp;P 500. Our absolute TSR for &nbsp; &nbsp; 48 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the performance period was 209.69% ($144.54), which satisfied the PSA payout requirement that TSR be positive. Our TSR relative to the S&amp;P 500 was in the 99.57 th percentile of the S&amp;P 500, well in excess of the 80th percentile performance that was a condition to receiving the maximum 150% multiplier. Based on this result, the total payment percentage for the fiscal 2018 PSAs was increased by 50%, resulting in the payout to our Named Executives of 215.12% of the target fiscal 2018 PSA shares. Vesting of Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s Long-Term Performance Stock Award Upon Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s appointment to CEO, he was granted a one-time long-term performance-based stock award (&#147;LTPSA&#148;). LTPSA payouts are tied to Microsoft&#146;s total shareholder return relative to the S&amp;P 500 (&#147;relative TSR&#148;) over three overlapping five-year performance periods. The first of these periods commenced with Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s appointment as CEO and ended February&nbsp;3, 2019. The second of these periods ended February&nbsp;3, 2020. Under the LTPSA, target awards are paid if Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR is at the 60% level, and at the maximum 150% of target level if Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR is at or above the 80% level. For each of the three five-year performance periods, the number of shares earned at threshold is 150,000, at target 600,000, and at maximum 900,000. During the second five-year performance period, Microsoft&#146;s market capitalization increased $985&nbsp;billion (from $341&nbsp;billion to $1,326&nbsp;billion), and Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR was in the 99 th percentile, resulting in Mr.&nbsp;Nadella earning and vesting in the maximum 900,000 shares. Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020 PSAs (Open Performance Periods) Performance under the fiscal year 2019 and 2020 PSAs will be determined following the end of the three-year performance periods ending June&nbsp;30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The number of shares of common stock to be earned will be based on an assessment of (1) performance against the metric goals during the applicable performance period, and (2) if Microsoft&#146;s absolute TSR is positive during the period, Microsoft&#146;s relative TSR during the period. The metrics and relative weights under the fiscal year 2019 and 2020 PSAs are as follows: &nbsp; Metrics &nbsp;&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp;Year 2019 Weights (%) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp;Year 2020 Weights (%) &nbsp; Commercial Cloud Revenue &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 34 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 35 &nbsp; Commercial Cloud Subscribers &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 33 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 34 &nbsp; Windows 10 Monthly Active Devices &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;/&nbsp;A &nbsp; Consumer Post-sales Monetization Gross Margin &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;/&nbsp;A &nbsp; LinkedIn Sessions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; Surface Gross Margin &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;/&nbsp;A &nbsp; Teams Monthly Active Usage &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;/&nbsp;A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 &nbsp; Xbox Game Pass Subscribers &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;/&nbsp;A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; Surface Revenue &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;/&nbsp;A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section&nbsp;6 &#150; Other Compensation Policies and Information No Significant Executive Benefits and Perquisites Our Named Executives are eligible for the same benefits available to our other full-time employees. In the U.S., our benefits include our section&nbsp;401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, health care plan, life insurance plans, and other welfare benefit programs. In addition to the standard benefits offered to all U.S. employees, we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our U.S. executive officers and senior managers. This deferred compensation plan is unfunded, and participation is voluntary. The deferred compensation plan allows our Named Executives to defer their base salary, the cash portion of their Incentive Plan awards, and certain on-hire bonuses. We do not contribute to the deferred compensation plan. Named Executives are eligible for matching gifts for charitable donations above the maximum for our other U.S.-based full-time employees. Mr. Courtois participates in the standard benefits for leadership team members in France, including profit sharing, a health exam, and a car allowance. During fiscal year 2020, we provided no executive-only perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named Executives other than matching gifts made to charitable organizations. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;49 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Post-Employment Compensation Our Named Executives do not have employment contracts. No Named Executive is entitled to any payments or benefits following a change in control of Microsoft. Our Named Executives may be eligible for additional vesting of their outstanding SAs following termination of employment on the same terms as our other employees. All U.S. employees who retire from Microsoft after (a)&nbsp;age 65 or (b)&nbsp;age 55 with 15 years of service are eligible for the continuation of vesting of outstanding SAs granted at hire or at the time of annual performance review, if the award was granted over one year before the date of retirement. A pro-rata portion of PSA shares will also continue vesting if the retirement occurs more than one year after the beginning of the performance period. As of June&nbsp;30, 2020, only Mr.&nbsp;Smith was retirement eligible, and the value of his SAs and PSAs eligible for continued vesting if he retired on that date was $27,924,625 (assuming PSAs are earned at 100% of target). All employees whose employment with Microsoft terminates due to death or total and permanent disability generally fully vest in their outstanding SAs. Our PSAs, and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s LTPSA that was granted to him in connection with his appointment as CEO, vest for the target number of shares upon death or total and permanent disability. The value of our Named Executives&#146; SAs, PSAs, and LTPSAs that would have vested assuming a June&nbsp;30, 2020 termination of employment due to death or total and permanent disability was: Mr. Nadella, $227,201,413; Ms. Hood, $52,481,973; Mr. Courtois, $38,781,069; Ms. Johnson, $25,204,714; and Mr. Smith, $44,283,980. In addition, our Named Executives are eligible to participate in the Microsoft Senior Executive Severance Benefit Plan (&#147;Severance Plan&#148;). The Severance Plan was adopted to help ensure continuity of key leaders by providing designated executives severance payments and benefits if their employment is terminated without cause. For purposes of the Severance Plan, &#147;cause&#148; means (i)&nbsp;a conviction or plea of guilty or no contest to a felony or certain misdemeanors; (ii)&nbsp;engaging in gross misconduct; (iii)&nbsp;repeated failure to substantially perform the duties of the executive&#146;s role; (iv)&nbsp;violation of any securities laws; or (v)&nbsp;violation of Microsoft&#146;s policies designed to prevent violations of law. The Severance Plan payments and benefits have four components &#150; cash, stock vesting, continued health care, and outplacement assistance &#150; all provided by Microsoft. Cash payments consist of (i)&nbsp;a severance payment equal to 12 months&#146; base salary plus target annual cash incentive award, payable in a lump sum within 60 days after termination of employment; and (ii)&nbsp;a pro-rata payment of the executive officer&#146;s target annual cash incentive award for the partial year of work, payable in a lump sum at the same time other Incentive Plan cash awards for the year are paid. Stock vesting applies to SAs and PSAs. SAs that otherwise would vest in the 12-month period after employment terminates continue to vest. After the first year of the PSA performance period is completed, a pro-rata portion of any PSA shares will also vest, and the number of shares subject to pro-ration is the lesser of the target award shares or the shares that are otherwise earned and payable after the end of the performance period. Continued contributions to premiums for COBRA health care continuation coverage and outplacement assistance will be provided on the same terms as are available to other employees whose employment is terminated without cause. There is no change-in-control provision in the Severance Plan. To receive the Severance Plan payments and benefits, the Named Executive must execute a separation agreement that includes a release of claims in favor of Microsoft, confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, and 12-month non-compete/non-solicitation restrictions. Mr.&nbsp;Nadella participates in the Severance Plan on the same terms as our other executive officers, except that under his LTPSA award, if Microsoft terminates his employment without cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) during a performance period, he will vest in a pro-rata fraction of the threshold 150,000 shares of Microsoft common stock subject to the award for his actual period of employment during the performance period. This table shows the amounts that would have been payable to our Named Executives upon a termination of employment without cause on June&nbsp;30, 2020. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Amount Payable ($) &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $107,182,736 1 &nbsp; Amy E.

To reinforce this value through our executive compensation program, our executive officers and certain other senior executives are subject to a strong &#145;no fault&#146; executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy. Under this policy, our Compensation Committee may seek to recover payments of incentive compensation if the performance results leading to a payment are later subject to a downward adjustment or restatement of financial or nonfinancial performance. Our Committee may use its judgment in determining the amount to be recovered where the incentive compensation was awarded subjectively. Our Committee may also seek recovery of up to the entire amount of any incentive compensation awarded during a period where a covered executive committed a significant legal or compliance violation. Our executive compensation recovery policy is available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Robust Stock Ownership Policy Our executive officers and certain other senior executives are required to maintain a minimum equity stake in Microsoft. This policy embodies our Compensation Committee&#146;s belief that our most senior executives should maintain a significant personal financial stake in Microsoft to promote a long-term perspective in managing our business. In addition, the policy helps align executive and shareholder interests, which reduces incentive for excessive short-term risk taking. Each covered executive is required to acquire and maintain ownership of shares of Microsoft common stock equal to a specified multiple of his or her base salary, which ranges from 5 to 15 times base salary, as shown in the table below. Each covered executive must retain 50% of all net shares (post-tax) that vest until achieving his or her minimum share ownership requirement. &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp;&nbsp; Share&nbsp;Ownership Requirement&nbsp;as&nbsp;of June&nbsp;30, 2020 &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15x&nbsp;base&nbsp;salary &nbsp; Amy E.

Smith &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8x&nbsp;base&nbsp;salary &nbsp; In fiscal year 2020, each of our Named Executives complied with our stock ownership policy. Our stock ownership policy is available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . Hedging and Pledging Policy Our Named Executives are subject to our Derivatives Trading, Hedging, and Pledging policy described on page 12. Deductibility of Executive Compensation Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (&#147;Section&nbsp;162(m)&#148;) imposes an annual deduction limit of $1&nbsp;million on the amount of compensation paid to each of the CEO, the CFO, and certain other current or former named executive officers (together, &#147;covered employees&#148;). Prior to the effectiveness of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#147;TCJA&#148;), the deduction limit did not apply to &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; satisfying the requirements of Section&nbsp;162(m). Cash and equity awards granted to our Named Executives under the Incentive Plan reported in the summary compensation table for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 were subject to one or more performance goals intended to satisfy the requirements of the exemption to Section&nbsp;162(m) for performance-based compensation, including a requirement of positive operating income for the fiscal year. The performance goal of positive operating income for the first fiscal year following the award also applied to the LTPSA granted to Mr.&nbsp;Nadella in February 2014. For fiscal year 2017 and 2018, the performance goals were approved by our Compensation Committee, following shareholder approval of the material terms of these performance goals under the Incentive Plan. Payment under the awards is conditioned on Committee certification that the goals and any other material terms have been met. Effective with fiscal year 2019, the TCJA eliminated the Section&nbsp;162(m) provisions exempting performance-based compensation and deferred compensation amounts payable after termination from employment from the $1&nbsp;million deduction limit, subject to an exception for remuneration pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November&nbsp;2, 2017. Based on current law, we believe the remuneration under our Incentive Plan reported in the summary compensation table that qualifies for this &#147;written binding contract&#148; exception is: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The portion of fiscal year 2018 cash incentives payable based on formulaic financial results &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Payments under fiscal year 2018 SAs &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Payments under our fiscal year 2018 PSAs to the extent attributable to fiscal year 2017 or 2018 performance against metrics established for those years &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;51 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SAs and PSAs that vest upon a Named Executive&#146;s termination of employment due to death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of the Section&nbsp;162(m) performance goal would not be deductible as performance-based compensation. In structuring compensation for our executive officers, our Compensation Committee considers whether compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes. However, the changes implemented to Section&nbsp;162(m) under the TJCA are expected to significantly limit deductibility of compensation paid under current and future awards to covered employees. Accordingly, our Committee awards compensation that is nondeductible. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;Risk&nbsp;Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We performed an annual assessment for the Compensation and Audit Committees of our Board of Directors to determine whether the risks arising from our fiscal year 2020 compensation policies and practices were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Microsoft. Our assessment reviewed the material elements of executive and non-executive employee compensation. We concluded these policies and practices do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Microsoft. &nbsp; The structure of our compensation program for our executive officers does not incentivize unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. The base salary component of compensation does not encourage risk-taking because it is a fixed amount. The Incentive Plan awards have these risk-limiting characteristics: &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Cash incentive awards under the Incentive Plan are limited to 200% of a&nbsp;target cash incentive award &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Cash incentive awards are structured 50% based on pre-established goals (balance of growth and profitability goals) and 50% based on individual performance as assessed across three performance categories, diversifying the risk associated with any single aspect of performance &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;The majority of Incentive Plan award value is delivered in awards for shares of Microsoft common stock with multi-year vesting schedules or performance periods, which aligns the interests of our executive officers to long-term shareholder interests &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;We maintain robust executive stock ownership requirements ranging from 5x to 15x annual salary, which reduces incentive for excessive short-term risk taking &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;PSA metrics further diversify the elements of the program to minimize the incentive to produce any particular outcome &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;PSAs use Company-wide measures that are not specific to any one executive officer&#146;s sphere of responsibility and that apply equally to all participants to encourage a unified and responsible approach to achieving financial and strategic goals &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Overlapping performance periods for PSAs limit the impact of short-term business performance or share price fluctuations on final outcomes &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Equity awards are not made in the form of stock options, which may provide an asymmetrical incentive to take unnecessary or excessive risks to increase the market price of Microsoft common stock &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Members of our Compensation Committee (or for Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, the independent members of our Board of Directors) approve all Incentive Plan awards to executive officers, including performance achievement levels that determine final payout outcomes &nbsp; Awards are subject to our Executive Compensation Recovery Policy, described in this Section&nbsp;6 &#150; Other Compensation Policies and Information &#150; Strong Clawback Policy.

The value of SAs is reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends because dividends are not paid on SA shares until vesting. The value of PSAs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation valuation performed as of the date of grant by an independent third party. Because the grant date for a PSA occurs when performance targets are approved, and we approved performance targets in each of fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, PSA values in this column include: (i)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2020, 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2020 PSAs, the fiscal year 2019 PSAs, and the fiscal year 2018 PSAs (ii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2019, 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2019 PSAs, the fiscal year 2018 PSAs, and the fiscal year 2017 PSAs; and (iii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2018, 33.33% of each of the fiscal year 2018 PSAs and fiscal year 2017 PSAs, and 16.66% of the fiscal year 2016 PSAs. The grant date fair values of included PSAs, assuming at the grant date that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved for each PSA are: (i), for fiscal year 2020, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, $37,150,358; Ms.&nbsp;Hood, $18,704,870; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois, $13,664,213; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, $9,109,511; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $15,866,522; (ii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2019, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, $35,050,220; Ms.&nbsp;Hood, $19,823,991; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois, $15,380,642; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, $10,253,798; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $17,211,903; and (iii)&nbsp;for fiscal year 2018, Mr.&nbsp;Nadella, $21,723,387; Ms.&nbsp;Hood $12,921,957; Mr.&nbsp;Courtois, $7,114,107; Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, $7,551,291; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $11,429,189. &nbsp; (2) Includes Incentive Plan cash incentives. &nbsp; (3) None of our Named Executives received reimbursements for relocation expenses or tax-gross-up payments in the last three fiscal years.

SAs and PSAs were granted under the 2017 Stock Plan, except that the 2018 PSAs were granted under the 2001 Stock Plan. &nbsp; (2) This column represents fiscal year 2020 cash incentives as reported in the &#147;Non-equity Incentive Plan Compensation&#148; column of the Summary Compensation Table. &nbsp; (3) These columns represent the threshold, target, and maximum shares for the PSAs with a grant date in fiscal year 2020. Because the grant date for a PSA occurs when PSA performance targets are approved, the reported number of shares is calculated as the target shares for the portion of the PSAs for which performance targets were set in fiscal year 2020 (33.33% of each of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 PSAs). The threshold is calculated as if the threshold of only the least weighted metric (50% of 7% for 2020 PSAs and 50% of 5% for each of the 2019, and 2018 PSAs) is met. The maximum is calculated assuming all maximum targets were met and the relative TSR multiplier was fully earned. &nbsp; (4) Includes the grant date fair values for SAs and PSAs calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on the market price of the shares subject to the award on the date of grant. The value of SAs is reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends because dividends are not paid on SA shares until vesting. Values for PSAs in this column are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation performed as of the date of grant by an independent third party. &nbsp; &nbsp; 54 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding Equity Awards at June&nbsp;30, 2020 This table provides information about unvested SAs and PSAs held by the Named Executives on June&nbsp;30, 2020. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Awards &nbsp; Named Executive &nbsp; Award Date &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Number&nbsp;of Shares&nbsp;or&nbsp;Units of Stock that Have Not Vested 1 (#) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Market&nbsp;Value of Shares or Units&nbsp;of&nbsp;Stock that Have Not&nbsp;Vested 2 ($) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Equity&nbsp;Incentive&nbsp;Plan Awards: Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested 1 (#) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Equity&nbsp;Incentive Plan Awards: Market&nbsp;or&nbsp;Payout Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Unearned Shares, Units, or Other Rights That Have Not Vested 2 ($) &nbsp; Satya Nadella &nbsp; &nbsp; 2/4/2014 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 150,000 3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 30,526,500 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/20/2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 16,316 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,320,469 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/19/2017 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 37,616 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,655,232 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/19/2017 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100,308 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 20,413,681 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/18/2018 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 69,550 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 14,154,121 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/18/2018 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 74,186 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 15,097,593 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/18/2019 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 90,672 4 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 18,452,659 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/18/2019 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 30,224 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,150,886 &nbsp; Amy E.

Microsoft&#146;s Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded and unsecured. It allows participants to defer a specified percentage of their base salary (up to 75%) and/or eligible cash incentives (up to 100%). Participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to U.S. senior managers, including our U.S. Named Executives. Microsoft does not contribute to the Deferred Compensation Plan or guarantee any returns on participant contributions. When an employee elects to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan, the employee must specify the percentage of base salary and/or cash incentive award to be deferred and the timing of distributions. No withdrawals are permitted prior to the previously elected distribution date, other than withdrawals for certain severe financial hardships as permitted by applicable law. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with hypothetical investment earnings based on participant investment elections made from among deemed investment options available under the plan. &nbsp; &nbsp; 56 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CEO Pay Ratio For fiscal year 2020, the annual total compensation for the median employee of the Company (other than our CEO) was $172,142 and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $44,321,788. Based on this information, for fiscal year 2020 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 257 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We identified our median employee from among our employees as of June&nbsp;30, 2020, the last day of our fiscal year, excluding approximately 1,100 employees who became Microsoft employees in fiscal year 2020 in the following business acquisitions: ADRM Software, Inc., Affirmed Networks, Inc., BlueTalon, Inc., CyberX Israel LTD., Double Fine Productions, Inc., Gitalytics &#150; Devprod Tools Inc., jclarity Limited, Mover Inc., Movere, Inc., npm, Inc., Promote IQ &#150; SpotFront, Inc., Semmle Inc., Softomotive Holding Ltd, UpCounsel, Inc. (asset acquisition), and Azure VMWare Solutions by Virtustream LLC (asset acquisition). To identify our median employee, we used a &#147;total direct compensation&#148; measure consisting of: (i)&nbsp;fiscal year 2020 annual base pay (salary or gross wages for hourly employees, excluding paid leave), which we annualized for any permanent employees who commenced work during the year, (ii)&nbsp;bonuses and cash incentives payable for fiscal year 2020 (excluding allowances, relocation payments, and profit-sharing), and (iii)&nbsp;the dollar value of SAs granted in fiscal year 2020. Compensation amounts were determined from our human resources and payroll systems of record. Payments not made in U.S. dollars were converted to U.S. dollars using 12-month average exchange rates for the year. To identify our median employee, we then calculated the total direct compensation for our global employee population and excluded employees at the median who had anomalous compensation characteristics. Our Compensation Committee was provided with information on the fiscal year 2019 CEO pay ratio before recommending Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s fiscal year 2020 target annual compensation. &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity Compensation Plan Information This table provides information about shares of Microsoft common stock that may be issued under our equity compensation plans approved by shareholders and plans not approved by shareholders (if any) as of June&nbsp;30, 2020. Under the 2017 and 2001 Stock Plans, no option or stock appreciation rights may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, repurchased for cash or other consideration, or modified without shareholder approval (except in connection with a change in our capitalization) if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the shares underlying the award. &nbsp; Plan Category &nbsp;&nbsp; Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Securities to&nbsp;be Issued upon Exercise&nbsp;of&nbsp;Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights 1 (a) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighted-Average Exercise price of Outstanding Options,&nbsp;Warrants and Rights 2 ($)(b) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation&nbsp;Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected&nbsp;in&nbsp;Column&nbsp;(a)) 3 (c) &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity compensation plans approved by security&nbsp;holders &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 128,697,377 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $19.20 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 380,053,531 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N/A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 128,697,377 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $19.20 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 380,053,531 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Represents shares issuable upon vesting of outstanding SAs granted under the 2017 and 2001 Stock Plans and PSAs for which there is a grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718; includes shares under PSAs and Mr.&nbsp;Nadella&#146;s LTPSA that will vest if target performance levels are achieved. &nbsp; (2) The weighted average exercise price does not take into account the shares issuable upon vesting of outstanding stock awards, which have no exercise price. &nbsp; (3) Includes 96,165,738 shares remaining available for issuance as of June&nbsp;30, 2020 under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. &nbsp; &nbsp; Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation Mses. Peterson, Walmsley, and Warrior, and Messrs. Scharf and Stanton were members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2020. All members of the Committee were independent directors, and no member was an employee or former employee of Microsoft. During fiscal year 2020, none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee (or its equivalent) or board of directors of another entity where one of our Committee members was an executive officer, and no Committee member had a relationship requiring disclosure under Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors &#150; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;57 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER COMPENSATION &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stock Ownership Information As of October&nbsp;8, 2020, this table describes the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each director, director nominee, and Named Executive, and all directors and executive officers as a group, together with additional underlying shares or stock units as described in Notes 2 through 4 to the table.

Audit Committee Matters &nbsp; &nbsp; Audit Committee Report Charter and Responsibilities The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. It is available on our website at https://aka.ms/policiesandguidelines . The charter, which was last amended effective July&nbsp;1, 2020, includes a calendar that outlines the Committee&#146;s duties and responsibilities. The Committee reviews the charter and calendar annually and works with the Board of Directors to amend them as appropriate to reflect the evolving role of the Committee. The Board has the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including oversight of the management of Microsoft. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of Microsoft, the audits of Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the qualifications and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged as Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, and the performance of Microsoft&#146;s internal auditor. The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. Management is also responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of Microsoft&#146;s system of internal control. Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP (&#147;Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#148;), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The independent auditor is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Microsoft&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Fiscal Year 2020 Activity During fiscal year 2020, the Audit Committee fulfilled its duties and responsibilities as outlined in the charter and the accompanying calendar. The Committee meets twice each quarter; once in connection with quarterly Board of Directors meetings and once to review the quarterly Form 10-Q or annual Form 10-K. In addition, the Committee meets as needed to address emerging accounting, compliance, or other matters or for educational training. Specifically, the Committee: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditor Microsoft&#146;s quarterly earnings press releases, consolidated financial statements, and related periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and discussed with management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and the independent auditor&#146;s opinion about the effectiveness of Microsoft&#146;s internal control over financial reporting &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and discussed with management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor, as appropriate, the audit scopes and plans of both the internal auditor and the independent auditor &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Inquired about significant business and financial reporting risks, reviewed Microsoft&#146;s policies for risk assessment and risk management, and assessed the steps management is taking to control these risks &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Met in periodic executive sessions with each of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor to discuss the results of the examinations by the independent and internal auditors, their evaluations of internal controls, and the&nbsp;overall quality of the Company&#146;s financial reporting, and any other matters as appropriate &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Met with the CEO and CFO to discuss the processes they have undertaken to evaluate the accuracy and fair presentation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed with management and the independent auditor the Company&#146;s critical accounting policies, significant changes in the selection or application of accounting principles, the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, and critical audit matters addressed during the audit &nbsp; &nbsp; 60 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed the Company&#146;s related party transactions and Policy for Related Party Transactions &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Received reports about the receipt, retention, and treatment of financial reporting and other compliance concerns &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed and assessed the qualitative aspects of the Company&#146;s ethics and compliance programs &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Reviewed with the Chief Compliance Officer, legal and regulatory matters that may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Statements The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditor Microsoft&#146;s audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2020, and the independent auditor&#146;s&nbsp;report on those financial statements. Management represented to the Committee that Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche presented the matters required to be discussed with the Committee by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) standards and Rule 2-07 of SEC Regulation&nbsp;S-X. This review included a discussion with management and the independent auditor of the quality (not&nbsp;merely the&nbsp;acceptability) of Microsoft&#146;s accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. Based on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Microsoft&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2020, for filing with the SEC. Independent Auditor Tenure and Rotation As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche has been Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor since the Company&#146;s initial public offering in 1986. Deloitte rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years; the Audit Committee interviews proposed candidates and selects the lead audit engagement partner. The Committee selected a new Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche lead audit engagement partner beginning with the fiscal year 2020 audit. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having an independent auditor with an extensive history with the Company. These include: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Higher quality audit work and accounting advice due to Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s institutional knowledge of our business and operations, accounting policies and financial systems, and internal control framework &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Operational efficiencies and a resulting lower fee structure because of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s history and familiarity with our business Independence and Performance of Outside Audit Firm The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, both in fact and appearance, and takes a number of measures to ensure independence. The Committee leads the selection of the lead audit engagement partner, working with Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche with input from management. The Committee has established a policy pursuant to which all services, audit and non-audit, provided by the independent auditor must be pre-approved by the Committee or its delegate. This policy prohibits the independent auditor from providing non-audit services such as bookkeeping or financial systems design and implementation. The Company&#146;s pre-approval policy is more fully described below in this Part 3 &#150; Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor. The Committee has concluded that the amount and nature of those services provided was compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche. In addition, Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche has provided the Committee with the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant&#146;s communications with the audit committee concerning independence. The Committee has reviewed these materials and discussed the firm&#146;s independence with Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche. As provided in its charter, in addition to evaluating Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s independence, the Audit Committee performed its annual assessment of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s performance as independent auditor during fiscal year 2020. The Committee assessed the performance of the Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche lead audit engagement partner and the audit team. The Committee reviewed a variety of indicators of audit quality including: &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The quality and candor of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s communications with the Audit Committee and management &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; How effectively Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche maintained its independence and employed its independent judgment, objectivity, and professional skepticism &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;61 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The level of engagement and value provided by the Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche national office &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The depth and expertise of the global Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche audit team &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The quality of insight demonstrated in Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s review of the Company&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and remediation of control deficiencies &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Available external data about quality and performance, including reports of the PCAOB on Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche and its peer firms and Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s response to those reports &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; The appropriateness of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s fees, taking into account the size and complexity of the Company and the resources necessary to perform the audit &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s knowledge of our global operations, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting &nbsp; &#149; &nbsp; Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche&#146;s tenure as the Company&#146;s independent auditor and safeguards in place to maintain its independence Recommendation of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche as Independent Audit Firm for Fiscal Year 2021 As a result of its evaluation, the Audit Committee concluded that the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche as the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2021 is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.

Audit fees also include advice about accounting matters that arose in connection with or as a result of the audit or the review of periodic financial statements and statutory audits that non-U.S. jurisdictions require. Audit-Related Fees Audit-related fees consist of assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting. This category may include fees related to the performance of audits and attest services not required by statute or regulations; audits of our employee benefit plans; due diligence related to mergers, acquisitions, and investments; additional revenue and license compliance procedures related to the performance of review or audit of Microsoft&#146;s consolidated financial statements; third-party assurance audits for cloud services; and &nbsp; &nbsp; 62 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accounting consultations about the application of GAAP to proposed transactions. Revenue assurance and license compliance includes procedures under contracts we have entered that provide for review by an independent accountant, and advice about controls associated with the completeness and accuracy of our software licensing revenue. These services support the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over revenue recognition and enhance the independent auditor&#146;s understanding of our licensing programs and controls. Tax Fees Tax fees generally consist of tax compliance and return preparation, and tax planning and advice. Tax compliance and return preparation services consist of preparing original and amended tax returns and claims for refunds. Tax planning and advice services consist of support during income tax audits or inquiries. All Other Fees All other fees consist of permitted services other than those that meet the criteria above and include training activities, and subscriptions and surveys on economic, industry, accounting, and human resources topics. The Audit Committee concluded that the provision of the non-audit services listed above is compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche. &nbsp; &nbsp; Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor The Audit Committee has a policy for pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. Each year, the Committee approves the terms on which the independent auditor is engaged for the ensuing fiscal year. At least quarterly, the Committee reviews and, if appropriate, pre-approves services to be performed by the independent auditor, reviews a report summarizing fiscal year-to-date services provided by the independent auditor, and reviews an updated projection of the fiscal year&#146;s estimated fees. The Committee, as permitted by its pre-approval policy, from time to time delegates the approval of certain permitted services or classes of services to a member of the Committee. The Committee then reviews the delegate&#146;s approval decisions each quarter. Microsoft uses a centralized internal system to collect requests from Company personnel for services by the independent auditor to facilitate compliance with this pre-approval policy. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;63 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.

We hold our say-on-pay vote every year. &nbsp; Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. Statement in Support Pay for Performance Through our ongoing shareholder engagement, we receive consistent feedback that our investors favor incentive compensation arrangements tied to specific performance measures that drive long-term performance and value creation. We have responded to investor feedback, and our program design has evolved so that it incorporates performance elements directly linked to achievement of our long-term strategic goals. Key features of our fiscal year 2020 executive compensation program were: &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;56%of the annual target compensation opportunity for our Named Executive Officers was performance-based, on average &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%of the annual cash incentive was tied to achieving pre-established financial targets (and for our CEO, this increases to 70% in fiscal year 2021) &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%of the annual target equity opportunity for our Named Executive Officers was delivered in the form&nbsp;of performance-based stock awards with payouts based on achievement against pre-established strategic objectives (and for our CEO, this increases to 70% in fiscal year 2021) &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metricsunder our performance stock awards are strategic measures that drive long-term growth &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ourperformance stock awards included a relative total shareholder return multiplier,&nbsp;to reward significant positive outperformance, thereby strengthening the alignment of the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our long-term shareholders &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay&nbsp;for&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50% annual cash incentive determined formulaically, based on achievement against pre-established financial targets. (70% for CEO in FY21) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50% target equity awards were performance stock awards with strategic metrics. (70% for CEO in FY21) &nbsp; Sound Program Design We design our executive compensation program to attract, motivate, and retain the key executives who drive our success and industry leadership. Pay that reflects performance and alignment of that pay with the interests of long-term shareholders are key principles that underlie our compensation program. We achieve these objectives through compensation that: &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides a competitive total target pay opportunity &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consists primarily of equity compensation, which encourages our executives to act as owners with a significant stake in Microsoft &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivers a majority of pay based on performance &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhances long-term focus by subjecting a significant percentage of total target compensation to multi-year performance requirements or vesting &nbsp; &#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;65 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Best Practices in Executive Compensation Our executive compensation program follows best practices. &nbsp; &nbsp; What We Do &nbsp; &#149; &#8201;&#8202; Maintain a stock ownership policy that reinforces the alignment of executive officer and shareholder interests (including stock ownership of 15x base salary for the CEO) &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Have a strong executive compensation recovery (&#147;clawback&#148;) policy to ensure accountability &nbsp; &#149; &#8201;&#8202; Promote long-term focus through multi-year vesting and performance requirements &nbsp; &#149; &#8201;&#8202; Prohibit pledging, hedging, and trading in derivatives of Microsoft securities &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; Retain an independent compensation consultant &nbsp; &#149; &#8201;&#8202; Solicit investor feedback on our compensation program and potential enhancements through an extensive shareholder engagement program &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What We Don&#146;t Do &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No excessive perquisites (e.g., no executive-only club memberships, medical benefits), and no tax gross-ups &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No employment agreements &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No change in control benefits &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No executive-only retirement programs &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No guaranteed bonuses &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No dividends paid on unvested stock awards &nbsp; &#149;&#8201;&#8202; No encouragement of unnecessary and excessive risk taking &nbsp; Our Board and Compensation Committee reviewed the prior year&#146;s voting results and, through our regular shareholder engagement, sought to understand the factors that influenced voting decisions. As a result of our engagement with shareholders, we have taken responsive action: &nbsp; Feedback Themes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Actions Taken &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Increase the performance-based component of the annual cash incentive &#150; to further strengthen our CEO&#146;s accountability to achieving results on the objective financial metrics that most closely align with our business strategy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Increased the weighting of the financial performance portion of the CEO&#146;s annual cash incentive from 50% to 70% for fiscal year 2021, split evenly between Incentive Plan Revenue (35%) and Incentive Plan Operating Income (35%) &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Shift the mix of our CEO&#146;s equity award to be majority performance-based &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Increased the performance-based portion of our CEO&#146;s equity awards from 50% to 70% for fiscal 2021 &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Include a downside adjustment on the PSA payout, so that the TSR multiplier provides both upside and downside exposure for executives &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Revised the relative TSR modifier for fiscal year 2021 PSAs to include a downside adjustment on PSA payout if relative TSR falls below the 40th percentile of the S&amp;P 500 &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Investors would benefit from additional disclosure regarding the Compensation Committee&#146;s process to determine incentive compensation results &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#149;&#8194;Increased the disclosure of goal-setting process and performance stock award results The Board and the Compensation Committee will continue to consider feedback obtained through our shareholder engagement process in making future decisions about our executive compensation program. &nbsp; &nbsp; 66 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Management&nbsp;Proposal&nbsp;3:&nbsp;Ratification&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;of&nbsp;Deloitte&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;Touche&nbsp;LLP&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;our&nbsp;Independent&nbsp;Auditor&nbsp;for Fiscal&nbsp;Year 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP as Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor for fiscal year 2021. The Board asks shareholders to ratify that selection. Although current law, rules, and regulations, and the charter of the Audit Committee require the Audit Committee to engage, retain, and supervise Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor, the Board considers the selection of the independent auditor to be an important matter of shareholder concern and is submitting the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche for ratification by shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice. As described in Part 3 &#150; Audit Committee Matters, the Board considers the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche as Microsoft&#146;s independent auditor for fiscal year 2021 to be in the best interests of Microsoft and its shareholders. &nbsp; Receipt of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve this proposal. If the selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider the result a recommendation to consider selection of a different firm. &nbsp; The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the independent auditor. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholder&nbsp;Proposal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NorthStar Asset Management, Inc. has advised us that it intends to submit the following proposal for consideration at the Annual Shareholder Meeting. We will furnish the address and number of shares held by the proponent upon receipt of a request for such information to the Corporate Secretary. &nbsp; Receipt of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve this proposal. &nbsp; Employee Representation on the Board of Directors WHEREAS: Our employees are crucial to our ability to offer shareholders continued return on their investment. A 2018 Forbes article emphasized the need for retaining top employees by &#147;focus[ing] on excellence in engagement&#148;; In 2018, the Accountable Capitalism Act was introduced into the U.S. Congress to combat &#147;America&#146;s fundamental economic problems&#148; such as companies&#146; failure to reinvest proceeds in their operations, including employees. The Act would require that &#147;boards ... include substantial employee participation ... ensur[ing] that no fewer than 40% of [a board&#146;s] directors are selected by the corporation&#146;s employees&#148;; In 2019, the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of America&#146;s leading companies, issued a new Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation which emphasized &#147;a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders.&#148; Coupled with a worldwide increased interest in environmental and social considerations, this new focus on &#147;stakeholder capitalism&#148; can be understood to imply that a company&#146;s fiduciaries must address or reflect the interests of all stakeholders; In 2020, the World Economic Forum explained that &#147;[i]ssues that were previously considered secondary for CEOs and boards&#151;matters once handled by companies&#146; stakeholder-relations, philanthropy, and information-technology departments&#151;have become important determinants of firms&#146; capacity to create and sustain economic value ... The talent and motivation of a firm&#146;s workforce, an innovative corporate culture, individual know-how, and data all are becoming increasingly important sources of value&#148;; Shareholders believe that allowing employee representation on boards of directors will support continued company growth within stakeholder capitalism. Several European countries require employee representation on boards. Academic analysis of one such policy stated that it &#147;offer[s] advantages for technical efficiency, skill development and knowledge generation through its protection of specific human capital investments&#148;; Employee commitment to the long-term growth of our company, especially during the COVID-19 crisis and recovery, will be vital to our company&#146;s success. Shareholders believe that our company can advance long-term value creation through a board that includes non-management employee representation. RESOLVED: Shareholders of Microsoft urge the Board of Directors to prepare a report to shareholders describing options for the company to encourage the inclusion of non-management employee representation on the Board. SUPPORTING STATEMENT : The report should be prepared within one year, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary and privileged information. The Board is encouraged to assess: &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp; Any legal, technical, practical, or organizational impediments to non-management employees gaining board seats; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;67 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. &nbsp; Potential benefits and efficiencies associated with board membership of non-management employees; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. &nbsp; Procedures through which non-management employees could gain nomination to the board, such as allocation of board slots, special nomination process, building upon existing proxy access provision, and/or changes to corporate bylaws that might help accomplish such changes; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. &nbsp; Options for employees to participate in governance through other structures such as employee councils, joint labor-management committees, or labor unions. For purposes of this proposal, &#147;non-management employees&#148; should be understood to be employees that are neither management nor company executives. &nbsp; Board Recommendation on Shareholder Proposal &nbsp; The Board recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: COMPANY STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION Microsoft&#146;s Board of Directors has a strong interest in ensuring the Company has a respectful, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that enables the Company and its employees to thrive. Indeed, the Board recognizes the Company&#146;s cultural transformation as a key element behind the Company&#146;s success over the past several years. However, the Board does not believe the steps called for in this proposal are the best way to fulfill its ongoing commitment to ensure Microsoft&#146;s organizational health and oversee efforts to provide the best possible work experience for Microsoft employees. The Board gains insights into organizational health and employees&#146; experiences through a broad set of global data and engagements. The Board as a whole and its Compensation Committee engage with the Company&#146;s senior leadership team and human resources executives across a range of topics including culture, compensation and benefits, employee recruiting and retention, diversity and inclusion, and succession planning and development. The Board receives an annual briefing on the results of Microsoft&#146;s anonymous poll of our entire global employee population to collect feedback on management, strategy, culture, compensation, inclusion, and many other areas. Board members have opportunities to engage directly with employees across all levels of the Company, not just the senior leadership team, through participation in internal employee conferences and networking events, department meetings, campus visits, and meetings focused on connecting the Board with emerging leaders from across the employee base. The Board has also built accountability for these things into our executive compensation program. As detailed in Part&nbsp;2 of this Proxy Statement, our Named Executive Officers&#146; annual cash incentives include consideration of their performance on a variety of qualitative factors including diversity and inclusion and workplace culture. In addition, open and respectful communication is one of Microsoft&#146;s core values. We encourage employees to raise issues or questions through our Open Door Policy, which states that employees can raise any concerns or questions to any member of management or to HR. We have multiple channels for all stakeholders, including employees, to provide feedback to management. For example, typically approximately 90% of our employees around the world provide responses to our annual employee poll. Our Chief Executive Officer and senior leaders regularly host Company- and organization-wide meetings, to provide business updates and answer questions posed by employees. Employees can raise questions at any time on the CEO Connection page on Yammer. As we describe in our Company-wide Standards of Business Conduct training, employees have multiple avenues to raise and have addressed, anonymously if they wish, any compliance or other concern. Shareholders, including employees, may also submit communications related to corporate governance to the Board&#146;s attention through a dedicated email address. The Company and the Board takes information communicated through these avenues very seriously, and management regularly provides responses and updates on issues that employees raise to the Board. The proposal would also require the Company to deviate from our existing rigorous processes to ensure strong, independent oversight by our Board. Our existing director selection process is designed to identify and nominate the strongest director candidates from all available sources. We believe an employee candidate for the Board should be evaluated by the same standards and criteria as any other candidate. As described in Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors &#150; Director Selection and Qualifications, our Governance and Nominating Committee, along with the full Board, evaluates and recommends director nominees. In doing so, they carefully assess the specific qualifications of potential director nominees and determine whether they will contribute to an effective, diverse Board that operates openly and collaboratively to serve the best interests of all of our shareholders. As stated in Director Selection and Qualifications, the Board considers many factors, including general understanding of global business, sales and marketing, finance, and other disciplines relevant to the success of a large, publicly traded company; understanding of our business and technology; educational and professional background; personal accomplishment; and national, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. &nbsp; &nbsp; 68 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any shareholder can recommend a prospective director candidate, including a Company employee, for the Board&#146;s consideration. We describe how to do this above Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors &#150; Director Selection and Qualifications &#150; Shareholder Recommendations and Nomination of Director Candidates. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider and evaluate nominees proposed by shareholders in the same manner as a nominee recommended by a Board member, management, search firm, or any other source. Giving non-management employees a dedicated position on the Board, a different process for board representation, or a different set of qualifications would undercut the role of the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board in one of the most important and strategic elements of corporate governance. Having an independent board is a core element of our governance philosophy. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our directors will be independent. Except for our CEO Satya Nadella, all our current directors are independent. This proposal suggests we should add another director employed by Microsoft. This would decrease the number of directors who qualify as independent of the Company. For these reasons, the Board believes that changing our board nomination and membership framework with respect to Company employees as outlined by this proposal is unnecessary and will not enhance value for our business, employees, or shareholders. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;69 Table of Contents 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; GOVERNANCE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMED EXECUTIVE&nbsp;OFFICER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; AUDIT COMMITTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MATTERS &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; PROPOSALS&nbsp;TO BE&nbsp;VOTED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;DURING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MEETING &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.

If you are a beneficial shareholder, you may contact the broker or bank where you hold the account. &nbsp; &nbsp; Election of Directors Twelve directors are to be elected during the Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, no directors are elected at an annual meeting, a slate of directors may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by our Bylaws. The accompanying proxy will be voted in favor of the nominees presented in Part 1 &#150; Governance and our Board of Directors to serve as directors unless the shareholder indicates to the contrary on the proxy. All of this year&#146;s nominees are current directors. The Board expects that each of the nominees will be available for election, but if any of them is unable to serve at the time the election occurs, the proxy will be voted for the election of another nominee designated by our Board. Majority Vote Standard A nominee who does not receive a majority vote will not be elected. Except as explained in the next paragraph, an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote will continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of: (a)&nbsp;90 days after the date on which the election inspector determines the voting results as to that director, (b)&nbsp;the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by that director, or (c)&nbsp;the date of that director&#146;s resignation. The Board of Directors may fill any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director, or fill the office held by a holdover director, as provided in our Bylaws. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee who fails to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to our Board about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the Governance and Nominating Committee&#146;s recommendation and within 90 days after certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision.

On October 8, 2020, there were 7,562,826,058 shares of common stock outstanding, held of record by 91,537 shareholders. A majority of the outstanding shares of Microsoft common stock is required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. The shares of a shareholder whose ballot on any or all proposals is marked as &#147;abstain&#148; or, in the case of an uncontested election of directors, &#147;withheld&#148;, will be included in the number of shares present during the Annual Meeting to determine whether a quorum is present. Vote Required; Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes For each proposal submitted to the shareholders for a vote, approval requires a vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means the number of shares cast &#147;for&#148; a proposal exceeds the number of votes cast &#147;against&#148; that proposal. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast. Uninstructed shares will not be counted as votes cast except with respect to the Ratification of the Selection of our Independent Auditor, for which brokers and custodians have discretion to vote. A ballot for a director that is marked &#147;withheld&#148; will also not be counted as a vote cast. The following table summarizes the votes required for passage of each proposal and the effect of abstentions and uninstructed shares held by brokers. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Votes Required for Approval &nbsp;&nbsp; Abstentions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstructed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shares Management Proposals Election of 12 Directors &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive&nbsp;Officer&nbsp;Compensation (&#147;say-on-pay&#148;) &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; Ratification of the Selection of Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP as Independent Auditor for Fiscal Year 2021 &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discretionary&nbsp;vote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Shareholder Proposal Report on Employee Representation on Board of Directors &nbsp;&nbsp; Majority of votes cast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not voted &nbsp; Vote Confidentiality We maintain the confidentiality of the votes of individual shareholders.

The proxy solicitor and the proxy tabulator will disclose information taken from the ballots, proxy forms, and voting instructions only if there is a proxy contest, if the shareholder authorizes disclosure, to defend legal claims, or as otherwise required by law. If you write comments on your proxy card or ballot, management may learn how you voted in reviewing your comments.

We expect to publish the final vote tabulation on our website at http://www.microsoft.com/investor/ corporate-governance/votingresults.aspx within one business day after the Annual Meeting.

DATED: Redmond, Washington, October&nbsp;19, 2020. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2020 PROXY STATEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;73 Table of Contents &nbsp; Annex A &#150; Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) to non-GAAP financial results. Additional information regarding our&nbsp;non-GAAP&nbsp;definition is provided below. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve Months Ended June&nbsp;30, &nbsp; ($ in millions, except per share amounts) &nbsp; Revenue &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating Income &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net Income &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diluted Earnings per&nbsp;Share &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;2019 As Reported (GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; $125,843 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $42,959 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $39,240 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $5.06 &nbsp; Net Tax Impact of Transfer of Intangible Properties &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (2,567) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (0.33) &nbsp; Net Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#147;TCJA&#148;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 157 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.02 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;2019 As Adjusted&nbsp;(non-GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; $125,843 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $42,959 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $36,830 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $4.75 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;2020 As Reported (GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; $143,015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $52,959 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $44,281 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $5.76 &nbsp; Percentage Change Y/Y (GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; 14% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 23% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 13% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 14% &nbsp; Percentage Change Y/Y&nbsp;(non-GAAP) &nbsp; &nbsp; 14% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 23% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 20% &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 21% &nbsp; GAAP results include a net income tax benefit of $2.6&nbsp;billion and a net income tax charge of $157&nbsp;million for the twelve months ended June&nbsp;30, 2019. These net tax impacts are excluded from our&nbsp;non-GAAP&nbsp;results and explained in the&nbsp;Non-GAAP&nbsp;Definition section below. Non-GAAP Definition Transfer of Intangible Properties . In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6&nbsp;billion tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. The TCJA Impact . We recorded a net charge of $157 million during the twelve months ended June&nbsp;30, 2019 related to the TCJA. We have provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the transfer of intangible properties and the TCJA to aid investors in better understanding our performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures assist investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this proxy statement should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP Executive Incentive Plan (&#147;Incentive Plan&#148;) Performance Metrics in Compensation Discussion and Analysis We use certain non-GAAP financial performance metrics in our Incentive Plan, as described on pages 43-44 and 48. &nbsp; &nbsp; 74 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Table of Contents &nbsp; Microsoft Employee Giving Microsoft employees are passionate about giving time, money, and skills to address the issues facing our world.
