In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement 2. Second-quarter 2021 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding credit reserve releases (“significant item”) are non-GAAP financial measures. The credit reserve releases represent the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. Excluding credit reserve releases resulted in a decrease of $2.3B (after tax) to reported net income from $11.9B to $9.6B; a decrease of $0.75 per share to reported EPS from $3.78 to $3.03; and a decrease of 5% to ROTCE from 23% to 18%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results 3. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $84.85, $ 82.31 and $76.91 at June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 4. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excludes Firmwide legal expense of $185mm, $28mm and $118mm for the three months ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net revenue. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 5. Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”) calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans (“ALL/EOP”) excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio Additional notes 12 1. Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $3.8B, $4.5B and $6.5B, respectively. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 36-41 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 52-53 and Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information 2. Total excess high-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) represent the average eligible unencumbered liquid assets that are in excess of what is required to meet the estimated Firm and Bank total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress under the LCR rule. HQLA and unencumbered marketable securities, includes the Firm’s average eligible HQLA, other end-of-period HQLA-eligible securities which are included as part of the excess liquidity at the Bank that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates and thus excluded from the Firm’s LCR under the LCR rule, and other end-of-period unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities. Does not include borrowing capacity at Federal Home Loan Banks and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-46 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 and on pages 102-108 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information 3. In the first quarter of 2021, the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm's effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis. Refer to page 2 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement for further information 4. On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions; the restrictions were extended and expired at the end of the second quarter of 2021. Refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement for further information 5. In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated revenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Business segment changes on page 65 of the Firm’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information 6. In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation 7. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm realigned certain wealth management clients from AWM to CCB.

ALL/EOP loans as reported was 1.11%, 1.48%, and 2.16% at June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. See note 5 on slide 11 7. Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence of this refinement, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $2 million and $21 million, CIB trading VaR of $(1) million and $19 million and CIB VaR of zero and $20 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively 8.
