Earnings growth reflected record revenue, primarily offset by hi gher expense and the lack of a benefit from the provision for cr edit losses. Compared with the prior quarter, net income increased by $33 million, or 3%, reflecting higher revenue and lower expense, primarily offset by a higher provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $4.7 billion, up 48% from the prior year, driven by record investment banking fees and improved markets results. Investment banking fees of $1.6 billion were up 36% from the prior year driven by debt underwriting and advisory fees, both of which were at record levels. Debt underwriting fees of $771 million were up 51% driven by record loan syndication and strong bond underwriting fees. Advisory fees of $482 million were up 41%, which reflected strength across regions. Both de bt underwriting and advisory pe rformance benefited from high levels of corporate and financia l sponsor activity in the quarter. Equity underwriting fees of $327 million were up 5% reflecting strength in common stock offerings in Europe and the Americas. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $2.0 billion was up 77% from a weak prior-year quarter with improved performance in credit markets, currencies, and emerging markets, partially offset by lower results in securitized pr oducts. Compared with the prior quarter, Fixed Income Markets were down 17% from a strong prior quarter due to weaker commodities. Equity Markets revenue of $909 million nearly doubled from the prior year on strength in cash equities and equity derivatives and reflected strong perfor mance across regions. Credit Portfolio revenue of $263 million was down 43%, largely reflecting lower gains from loan workouts. Provision for credit losses was $63 million for the quarter compared with a benefit of $83 million in the prior year. The current-period provision c ontinues to reflect portfolio activity. Credit quality remained stable. Noninterest expense was $3.1 billion, up by $903 m illion, or 42%, from the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher performance-based compensation.

Results were impacted by the following items, which are all reported in the Regional Banking segment: a current quarter pre-tax net loss of $215 million co mpared with a prior year pre-tax net loss of $120 million due to mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale; the acquisition of The Bank of New York's consumer banking business on Octobe r 1, 2006; and the absence of the insurance business, which was sold on July 1, 2006. Net revenue of $3.7 billion was up by $134 million, or 4%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.6 billion was up 4% due to The Ba nk of New York transaction and the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services, higher deposit and home equity loan balances in Regional Banking, and wider loan spreads in Auto Finance. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business in the third quarter of 2006, lower auto loan and lease balances, and narrower spreads on deposit s and loans in Regional Banking. Noninterest revenue of $1.1 billion was up by $36 million, or 3%, including th e impact in Regional Banking of a $233 million current-quarter loss, compared with a $120 million prior-year loss, both related to mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale. Results benefited from increases in deposit-related and branch production fees, higher automobile operating lease revenue and The Bank of New York transaction. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business. The provision for credit losses of $262 million was up by $104 million from the prior year, primarily due to the establishment of additiona l allowance for loan losses related to loans acquired from The Bank of New York, increased net charge-offs (reflecting portfolio seasoning JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 4 and some deterioration in subprime mortgage) a nd a change in the timing of loss recognition in Auto Finance. Noninterest expense of $2.3 billion was up 7% , primarily due to The Bank of New York transaction and the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services, investments in the retail distribution network and higher depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. These increases were offset partially by the sale of the insurance business. Regional Banking net income of $619 million was down by $50 million from the prior year. Net revenue of $2.9 billion was up by $105 million, or 4%, including the impact of a $233 million current-quarter lo ss resulting from $13.3 billion of mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale, comp ared with a prior-year loss of $120 million, resulting from $3.3 billion of mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale. Results benefited from The Bank of New York tran saction; the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services; growth in deposits and home equity loans; and increases in deposit- related fees, investment sales and credit card sales. These benefits were offset partially by the sale of the insurance bus iness, a shift to narrower-spread deposit products, and narrower spreads on mortgages. The provision for credit losses was $165 million, up by $78 million, primarily due to additional allowance for loan losses related to the acquisition of loans from The Bank of New York and increased net charge-offs due to portfolio seasoning and so me deterioration in subprime mortgage. Noninterest expense of $1.7 billion was up by $94 million, or 6%, from the prior year. The increase was due to The Bank of Ne w York transaction, the acquisition of Collegiate Funding Services and investme nts in the retail distribution network, partially offset by the sale of the insurance business.

Net revenue of $410 million was down by $14 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Revenue comp rises production revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue.

Net mortgage servicing revenue , which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value, was $195 million, compared with $290 million in the prior ye ar. Loan servicing revenue of $598 million increased by $52 million on a 13% increase in third-party loans serviced.

Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset, representing run-off of the asse t against the realization of servicing cash flows, were negative $372 million. Noninterest expense was $354 million, up by $29 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher compensation expense related to an increase in the number of loan officers.

Auto Finance net income of $65 million was down by $6 million from the prior year. Net revenue of $411 million was up by $43 million, or 12%, reflecting higher automobile operating lease revenue and wide r loan spreads on lower loan and direct finance lease balances. The provision for credit losses of $97 million increased by $26 million, primarily the result of a change in the timing of recognition of bankruptcy-related credit losses for auto loans. Noninterest expense of $207 million increased by $27 million, or 15%, driven by increased depreciation expense on owned automobiles subject to operating leases. Highlights Include:  Average loan receivables were $38.7 billion, down by $3.9 billion, or 9%, from the prior year and down by $0.2 billion, or 1%, from the prior quarter.  Average lease-related assets of $3.4 b illion declined by $2.1 billion, or 38%, from the prior year.  The net charge-off rate was 0.75%, compared with 0.66% in the prior year.

Results were driven by a lower provision for credit losses due to significantly lower bankruptcy filings. End-of-period managed loans of $152.8 billion in creased by $10.6 billion, or 7%, from the prior year and by $9.0 billion, or 6%, from the prior quarter. Average managed loans of $147.4 billion increased by $8.5 billion, or 6%, from the prior year and by $5.7 billion, or 4%, from the prior quarter. The current quarter included loans acqui red with the Sears Canada credit card business, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2005 (l oan balances include $2.1 billion of average managed loans in the current quarter and $1.2 bi llion of average manage d loans in the prior year), and loans acquired with the Kohl’s privat e label portfolio, which closed in the second quarter of 2006 (loan balances include $2.0 billi on of average and $2.5 bi llion of e nd-of-period managed loans in the current quarter). Compared with the prior year, both average managed and end-of-period managed loans con tinued to be affected negatively by higher customer payment rates. Management believes th at contributing to th e higher payment rates are the new minimum payment rules and a higher proportion of customers in rewards-based programs. Compared with the prior quarter, payment rates have declined slightly. Net managed revenue was $3.8 billion, up by $29 million, or 1%, from the prior year. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was up by $92 million, or 3%. The increase in net interest income was driven by an increase in average managed loan balances, higher fees and lower revenue reversals associated with lower charge-offs. These increases were offset primarily by higher cost of funds on balance growth in promotional, introductory and tr ansactor loan balances, which increased due to continued investment in ma rketing. Noninterest re venue of $808 million was down by $63 million, or 7%. Interchange income increased, benefiting from 17% higher charge volume, but was more than offset by higher vo lume-driven payments to partners, including Kohl’s, and increased rewards expense (both of which are netted against interchange income). The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 3 billion, down by $955 million, or 43%, from the prior year. This benefit wa s due to a significant decrease in net charge-offs, reflecting the continued low level of bankruptcy losses, partially offset by in creased contractual net charge- offs. Compared with the prior quarter, the managed provision fo r credit losses was relatively flat. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.45%, down fr om 6.39% in the prior year and 3.58% in the prior quarter. The 30- day managed delinquency rate was 3.13%, up from 2.79% in the prior year, but down slightly from 3.17% in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense of $1.3 billion was up by $324 million, or 32%, from the prior year due largely to higher marketing spending and recent acquisitions. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Record net revenue was $1.0 billion, up by $102 m illion, or 11%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $708 million, up by $46 million, or 7%, due to higher liability balances and loan volumes, which benefited from organic gr owth and The Bank of New York transaction.

The improvement was due largely to an increase in assets under custody to $13.9 trillion, which was driven by market value appreciation and new business.

(b) Discontinued operations include the rela ted balance sheet and income statement ac tivity of selected corporate trust busines ses sold to The Bank of New York on October 1, 2006. Prior to the second quart er of 2006, these corporate trust businesses were reported in Tr easury & Securities Services. Results in the fourth quarter of 2006 included the following items: ($ millions) Pre-tax After-tax Gain on exchange of corporate trust (Corporate) $1,081 $622 Tax audit resolutions (Corporate) - 359 Material litigation insurance recoveries (Corporate) 137 85 SFAS 123R incremental expense (all LOBs) (43) (27) Merger costs (Corporate) (100) (62) RFS portfolio repositioning (Regional Banking) ($215) ($133) Discussion of Results:(see notes (a) (b) above) Net income was $4.5 billion, up by $1.8 billion, co mpared with $2.7 billion in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher reve nue, the after-tax gain related to the exchange of selected corporate trust businesses, the bene fit from tax audit resolutions and lower managed provision for credit losses. These increases were offset partially by higher noninterest expense and the absence of a $752 million after-tax gain on the sale of BrownCo in the prior year. Net managed revenue was $16.9 billion, up by $2.1 b illion, or 14%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue of $9.8 billion was up by $1.3 billion, or 15%, refl ecting the following: strong principal transactions revenu e; absence of prior-year losses on the sale of securities in Treasury; increased asset management, admini stration, and commission s revenue; and record investment banking fees. Partia lly offsetting these benefits was the absence of the prior-year gain on the sale of BrownCo, losses on mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale and lower credit card fee income. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, up by $825 million, or 13%, due to an improvement in the Corporate segment’s net in terest spread; increases in consumer loans, consumer deposits and wholesale liabilities; and wider spreads on trading-related assets. This JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 increase was offset partially by consumer lo an–spread compression, an d a shift to narrower- spread wholesale and consumer liabilities. The managed provision for credit losses was $1. 7 billion, down by $559 million, or 24%, from the prior year, largely due to lo wer bankruptcy-related losses in Card Services. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $184 million for th e quarter, compared with a benefit of $108 million in the prior year. The $184 million provisi on reflects portfolio ac tivity and stable credit quality. The wholesale loan net charge-off rate was 0.07% for both the current quarter and the prior year. The total consum er managed provision for cred it losses was $1.5 billion, $851 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to lower bankruptcy-related losses in Card Services. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2006, down by $249 million, or 10%, from the prior-year level of $2.6 billion. Noninterest expense was $9.7 billion, up by $1.3 billi on, or 16%, from the prior year. Insurance recoveries related to certain material litigation were $137 million in the current period, $208 million in the prior year and $17 million in the pr ior quarter. Merger costs of $100 million were incurred in the current quarter, $77 million in the prior year and $48 million in the prior quarter. Prior-year expense also included a $145 million cost due to the accelera ted vesting of stock options. Expense growth also was driven by higher compensation expe nse, acquisitions and marketing expense. Partially offsetting this growth were divestitures and expense efficiencies. Highlights Include:  Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.7% at December 31, 2006 (estimated), 8.6% at September 30, 2006, and 8.5% at December 31, 2005.  During the quarter, $1.0 billion of co mmon stock was repurchased, reflecting 21.1 million shares purchased at an aver age price of $47.33 per share. Year- to-date, $3.9 billion of common st ock was repurchased, reflecting 90.7 million shares purchased at an averag e price of $43.41 per share. As of December 31, 2006, $5.2 billion of capacity remained under the $8.0 billion share purchase program approved on March 21, 2006.  Headcount of 174,360 increased by 2,771 since September 30, 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 Merger and other financial information • Merger savings and cost related: For the quarter ended December 31 , 2006, approximately $700 million of merger savings have been realized, which is an annualized rate of $2.8 billion, in line with management’s target for the year. Management estimates that annualized savings will be approximately $3.0 billion by the end of 2007. Merger costs of $100 million were expensed during the fourth quarter of 2006, bringing the total amount incurred to $3.4 billion (including capitalized costs) sin ce the beginning of 2004. Management currently expects total merger costs will be approximately $3.8 billion (including The Bank of New York transaction). The remaining merger costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2007. • FASB Statement No. 123R (“Share-Based Payment”): JPMorgan Chase adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), (“Share-Based Payment”) as of January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires that stock compensation granted to retirement-eligible employees be fully expensed at, or prior to, the time of grant rather than amortized over the vesting period. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarte r of 2006, the firm expensed the full amount of the compensation expense associated with grants of restrict ed stock made in January 2006 to retirement-eligible employees. In addition, during the firs t quarter of 2006, the firm began to accrue the estimated cost of grants expected to be awarded in January 2007 to retirement-eligible employees. The total incremental expense recorded in 2006 was $712 million. Awards granted to retirement- eligible employees prior to January 1, 2006, have not been accelerated and will continue to be amortized over th e original vesting periods. The incremental expense incurred during 2006 were non-cash charges and represented accelerated re cognition of costs that would have been incurred in future periods. Notes: 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a report ed basis, management analyzes the firm’s and the lines’ of business results on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of “managed receivables” to evaluate the credit performance and over all financial performance of the underlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuing to use the cred it card for ongoing charges, a borrower’s credit performance will aff ect both the loan receiva bles sold under SFAS 14 0 and those not sold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed loan receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order to disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is pr esented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits are pres ented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology a llows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The co rresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (fourth quarter of 2006) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported to managed basis. 2. Pre-tax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pre-tax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis by which management evaluates the performance of TSS and AM against that of competitors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 JPMorgan Chase & Co.
