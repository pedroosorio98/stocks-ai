Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 148 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making the assessment, management used the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2018, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. James Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marianne Lake Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 26, 2019 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 149 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. February 26, 2019 We have served as the Firm’s auditor since 1965.

The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 155 Note 1 – Basis of presentation JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S. with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm’s business segments, refer to Note 31. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or certain limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant interest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately- held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment Notes to consolidated financial statements 156 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting- interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. Revenue recognition Interest income The Firm records interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. For further discussion of interest income, refer to Note 7. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income. Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when the Firm’s performance obligations are satisfied. For further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers, refer to Note 6. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. For further discussion of fair value measurement, refer to Notes 2 and 3. For further discussion of principal transactions revenue, refer to Note 6. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in OCI within stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 157 Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

Statements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2018 Revenue recognition – revenue from contracts with customers The adoption of this guidance requires gross presentation of certain costs that were previously offset against revenue. Adoption of the guidance did not result in any material changes in the timing of the Firm’s revenue recognition. This guidance was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, which resulted in an increase in both noninterest revenue and noninterest expense. The Firm did not apply any practical expedients. For additional information, refer to the table on page 158 of this Note, and Note 6. Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities The adoption of this guidance requires that certain equity instruments be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The guidance also provides an alternative to measure equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (the “measurement alternative”). The Firm elected the measurement alternative for its qualifying equity securities and the adoption of the guidance resulted in fair value gains of $505 million which were recognized in other income in the first quarter of 2018. For additional information, refer to Notes 2 and 10. Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities The adoption of this guidance requires that premiums be amortized to the earliest call date on certain debt securities. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and AOCI. For additional information, refer to the table below, and Notes 10 and 23. Hedge accounting The adoption of this guidance better aligns hedge accounting with the economics of the Firm’s risk management activities. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm also elected to transfer certain investment securities from HTM to AFS. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and AOCI as a result of the investment securities transfer and the revised guidance for excluded components. For additional information, refer to the table below, and Notes 5, 10 and 23. Treatment of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows The adoption of this guidance requires restricted cash to be combined with unrestricted cash when reconciling the beginning and ending cash balances on the Consolidated statements of cash flows. To align the Consolidated balance sheets with the Consolidated statements of cash flows, the Firm reclassified restricted cash into cash and due from banks or deposits with banks. In addition, for the Firm’s Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks. This guidance was applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts have been revised. For additional information, refer to the table below, and Note 25. Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost The adoption of this guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost to be reported separately in the Consolidated statements of income from the other cost components. This change was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, which resulted in an increase in compensation expense and a reduction in other expense. For additional information, refer to the table below, and Note 8. Reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI The adoption of this guidance permitted the Firm to reclassify from AOCI to retained earnings stranded tax effects due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in applicable tax rates under the TCJA. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and AOCI. For additional information, refer to the table below, and Note 23.

These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets (e.g., held-for-sale loans), liabilities and unfunded lending- related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use as inputs observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below. The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s VCG, which is part of the Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at fair value. The VGF is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO. Notes to consolidated financial statements 160 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Price verification process The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk- taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions. The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm: • Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are applied and determined based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid- offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take. • The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size. • Unobservable parameter valuation adjustments may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Unobservable parameter valuation adjustments are applied to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. For more information on such adjustments refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 175 of this Note. Valuation model review and approval If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction data such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs to those models. Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances, the head of the Model Risk function may grant exceptions to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. Valuation hierarchy A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 161 The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/ instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Securities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2 • Derivative features: for further information refer to the discussion of derivatives below. • Market rates for the respective maturity • Collateral characteristics Loans and lending-related commitments — wholesale Loans carried at fair value (e.g., trading loans and non- trading loans) and associated lending-related commitments Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent) • Relevant broker quotes • Observed market prices for similar instruments Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following: • Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating • Prepayment speed • Collateral characteristics Loans — consumer Trading loans — conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold (CCB, CIB) Fair value is based on observable prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity. Predominantly level 2 Investment and trading securities Quoted market prices are used where available. Level 1 In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on: Level 2 or 3 • Observable market prices for similar securities • Relevant broker quotes • Discounted cash flows In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products: Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs: • Collateral characteristics • Deal-specific payment and loss allocations • Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity • Credit spreads • Credit rating data Physical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data. Level 1 and 2 Notes to consolidated financial statements 162 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the valuation hierarchy Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives that are actively traded and valued using the exchange price. Level 1 Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as considering the contractual terms. The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices, commodity prices, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS spreads and recovery rates. Additionally, the credit quality of the counterparty and of the Firm as well as market funding levels may also be considered. Level 2 or 3 In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows: Structured credit derivatives specific inputs include: • CDS spreads and recovery rates • Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments Equity option specific inputs include: • Equity volatilities • Equity correlation • Equity-FX correlation • Equity-IR correlation Interest rate and FX exotic options specific inputs include: • Interest rate spread volatility • Interest rate correlation • Foreign exchange correlation • Interest rate-FX correlation Commodity derivatives specific inputs include: • Commodity volatility • Forward commodity price Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 175 of this Note. Mortgage servicing rights Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15. Level 3 Private equity direct investments Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of potential inputs include: Level 2 or 3 • Transaction prices • Trading multiples of comparable public companies • Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company • Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are not identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific issues and lack of liquidity. • Additional available inputs relevant to the investment. Fund investments (e.g., mutual/collective investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and real estate funds) Net asset value • NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV level. Level 1 • Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption (e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where observable activity is limited. Level 2 or 3(a) Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs Valued using observable market information, where available. Level 2 or 3 In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE. (a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 163 Product/instrument Valuation methodology Classification in the valuation hierarchy Structured notes (included in deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt) • Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note. • The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 175 of this Note. Level 2 or 3 Notes to consolidated financial statements 164 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K The following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

respectively, which were predominantly mortgage-related. (b) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, included within trading loans were $13.2 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $2.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. government agencies of $7.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and reverse mortgages of zero and $836 million, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 166 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K (c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships, refer to Note 5. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. (d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). (e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. For purposes of the tables above, the Firm does not reduce derivative receivables and derivative payables balances for this netting adjustment, either within or across the levels of the fair value hierarchy, as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. (f) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $747 million and $779 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2018 and 2017, were trading assets of $49 million and $54 million, respectively, and other assets of $698 million and $725 million, respectively. (g) Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted the recognition and measurement guidance. Equity securities that were previously reported as AFS securities were reclassified to other assets upon adoption. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 167 Level 3 valuations The Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). For further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, refer to pages 159– 163 of this Note. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to- period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date. For the Firm’s derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at December 31, 2018, interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated towards the upper end of the range; equity correlation, equity-FX and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated in the middle of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate inputs used in estimating the fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads and conditional default rates were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; loss severity and price inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range.

(f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. (g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price- based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 169 Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage- backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/ or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market- making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument- specific factors. Notes to consolidated financial statements 170 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables (e.g., how the change in one variable influences the change in the other). Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option. EBITDA multiple – EBITDA multiples refer to the input (often derived from the value of a comparable company) that is multiplied by the historic and/or expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of a company in order to estimate the company’s value. An increase in the EBITDA multiple, in isolation, net of adjustments, would result in an increase in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk- manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes Level 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 0.7% of total Firm assets at December 31, 2018. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2017, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 176. For the year ended December 31, 2018 Level 3 assets were $17.2 billion at December 31, 2018, reflecting a decrease of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2017, largely due to: • $1.2 billion decrease in trading assets — debt and equity instruments predominantly driven by a decrease of $1.0 billion in trading loans primarily due to settlements and net sales. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis During the year ended December 31, 2018, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $1.5 billion of total debt and equity instruments, the majority of which were trading loans, driven by an increase in observability. • $1.2 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.5 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $1.4 billion of total debt and equity instruments, the majority of which were trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability. • $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.6 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $1.1 billion of long-term debt driven by a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. During the year ended December 31, 2017, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $1.5 billion of trading loans driven by an increase in observability. • $1.2 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $2.5 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $1.7 billion of long-term debt driven by a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $1.4 billion of long-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a reduction in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $1.1 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.0 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $1.0 billion of trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses The following describes significant components of total realized/ unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. For further information on these instruments, refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 170-174. 2018 • $1.6 billion of net gains on liabilities largely driven by market movements in long-term debt. 2017 • $1.3 billion of net losses on liabilities predominantly driven by market movements in long-term debt. 2016 • There were no individually significant movements for the year ended December 31, 2016. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 175 Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary. The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Credit and funding adjustments: Derivatives CVA $ 193 $ 802 $ (84) Derivatives FVA (74) (295) 7 Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 174 in this Note and Note 23 for further information. Notes to consolidated financial statements 176 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The following tables present the assets held as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.

Of the $815 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2018, $667 million related to such equity securities. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. (b) Of the $264 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2018, $225 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 54% with a weighted average of 25%. There were no material liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Nonrecurring fair value changes The following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, related to financial instruments held at those dates.

For further information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), refer to Note 12. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 177 Equity securities without readily determinable fair values As a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance and the election of the measurement alternative in the first quarter of 2018, the Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in other income. In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2018, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable. As of or for the (in millions) Year ended December 31, 2018 Other assets Carrying value $ 1,510 Upward carrying value changes 309 Downward carrying value changes/impairment (160) Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 40 million Visa Class B shares, recorded at a nominal carrying value. These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa Class A shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B shares into Visa Class A shares is 1.6298 at December 31, 2018, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included in the following table. However, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of these disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures provided in the following table include only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s assets and liabilities. For example, the Firm has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this Note. Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short- term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.

Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. For additional information, refer to Note 1. (a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan loss calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses. (b) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, refer to page 161 of this Note. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 179 Note 3 – Fair value option The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments elected were previously accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending- related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements, such as those with an embedded derivative and/or a maturity of greater than one year • Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of CIB’s client-driven activities • Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value Notes to consolidated financial statements 180 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Changes in fair value under the fair value option election The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table. 2018 2017 2016 December 31, (in millions) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(e) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(e) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded(e) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ (35) $ — $ (35) $ (97) $ — $ (97) $ (76) $ — $ (76) Securities borrowed 22 — 22 50 — 50 1 — 1 Trading assets: Debt and equity instruments, excluding loans (1,680) 1 (c) (1,679) 1,943 2 (c) 1,945 120 (1) (c) 119 Loans reported as trading assets: Changes in instrument- specific credit risk 414 1 (c) 415 330 14 (c) 344 461 43 (c) 504 Other changes in fair value 160 185 (c) 345 217 747 (c) 964 79 684 (c) 763 Loans: Changes in instrument-specific credit risk (1) — (1) (1) — (1) 13 — 13 Other changes in fair value (1) — (1) (12) 3 (c) (9) (7) — (7) Other assets 5 (45) (d) (40) 11 (55) (d) (44) 20 62 (d) 82 Deposits(a) 181 — 181 (533) — (533) (134) — (134) Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements 11 — 11 11 — 11 19 — 19 Short-term borrowings(a) 862 — 862 (747) — (747) (236) — (236) Trading liabilities 1 — 1 (1) — (1) 6 — 6 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs — — — — — — 23 — 23 Long-term debt(a)(b) 2,695 — 2,695 (2,022) — (2,022) (773) — (773) (a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected is recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. (b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk. (c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income. (d) Reported in other income. (e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. For further information regarding interest income and interest expense, refer to Note 7. Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which a fair value election was made The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating- rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 181 Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected. 2018 2017 December 31, (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/ (under) contractual principal outstanding Loans(a) Nonaccrual loans Loans reported as trading assets $ 4,240 $ 1,350 $ (2,890) $ 4,219 $ 1,371 $ (2,848) Loans 39 — (39) 39 — (39) Subtotal 4,279 1,350 (2,929) 4,258 1,371 (2,887) All other performing loans Loans reported as trading assets 42,215 40,403 (1,812) 38,157 36,590 (1,567) Loans 3,186 3,151 (35) 2,539 2,508 (31) Total loans $ 49,680 $ 44,904 $ (4,776) $ 44,954 $ 40,469 $ (4,485) Long-term debt Principal-protected debt $ 32,674 (c) $ 28,718 $ (3,956) $ 26,297 (c) $ 23,848 $ (2,449) Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA 26,168 NA NA 23,671 NA Total long-term debt NA $ 54,886 NA NA $ 47,519 NA Long-term beneficial interests Nonprincipal-protected debt(b) NA $ 28 NA NA $ 45 NA Total long-term beneficial interests NA $ 28 NA NA $ 45 NA (a) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. (b) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal- protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. (c) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $6.9 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(82) million and $(76) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, refer to Note 27. Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk component The following table presents the fair value of structured notes, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. For additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios, refer to Note 12. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. For additional information on loans, refer to Note 12. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 183 The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale-related credit exposure by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. As a result of continued growth and the relative size of the portfolio, exposure to “Individuals,” which was previously disclosed in “All Other,” is now separately disclosed in the table below as “Individuals and Individual Entities.” This category predominantly consists of Wealth Management clients within AWM and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts. Predominantly all of this exposure is secured, largely by cash and marketable securities.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 184 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 5 – Derivative instruments Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market- making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk management derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate contracts to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increases or decreases as a result of variable- rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar– equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities contracts are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, refer to the discussion in the Credit derivatives section on pages 195-197 of this Note. For more information about risk management derivatives, refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 195 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 192-195 of this Note. Derivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. Derivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain derivative exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information on the Firm’s clearing services, refer to Note 27. Accounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. For further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, refer to Note 1. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 188-195 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. For further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes, refer to Notes 2 and 3. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 185 Derivatives designated as hedges The Firm adopted new hedge accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, which required prospective amendments to the disclosures, as reflected in this Note. For additional information on the impact upon adoption of the new guidance, refer to Notes 1 and 23. The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency– denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

(c) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 189 Derivatives netting The following tables present, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: • collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. • the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and • collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below. 2018 2017 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative receivables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 258,227 $ (239,498) $ 18,729 $ 305,569 $ (284,917) $ 20,652 OTC–cleared 6,404 (5,856) 548 6,531 (6,318) 213 Exchange-traded(a) 322 (136) 186 185 (84) 101 Total interest rate contracts 264,953 (245,490) 19,463 312,285 (291,319) 20,966 Credit contracts: OTC 12,648 (12,261) 387 15,390 (15,165) 225 OTC–cleared 7,267 (7,222) 45 7,225 (7,170) 55 Total credit contracts 19,915 (19,483) 432 22,615 (22,335) 280 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 163,862 (153,988) 9,874 155,289 (142,420) 12,869 OTC–cleared 235 (226) 9 1,696 (1,654) 42 Exchange-traded(a) 32 (21) 11 141 (7) 134 Total foreign exchange contracts 164,129 (154,235) 9,894 157,126 (144,081) 13,045 Equity contracts: OTC 26,178 (23,879) 2,299 22,024 (19,917) 2,107 Exchange-traded(a) 18,876 (15,460) 3,416 14,188 (12,241) 1,947 Total equity contracts 45,054 (39,339) 5,715 36,212 (32,158) 4,054 Commodity contracts: OTC 7,448 (5,261) 2,187 7,204 (e) (4,436) 2,768 (e) Exchange-traded(a) 8,815 (8,218) 597 8,854 (8,701) 153 Total commodity contracts 16,263 (13,479) 2,784 16,058 (e) (13,137) 2,921 (e) Derivative receivables with appropriate legal opinion 510,314 (472,026) 38,288 (d) 544,296 (e) (503,030) 41,266 (d)(e) Derivative receivables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 15,925 15,925 15,257 (e) 15,257 (e) Total derivative receivables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 526,239 $ 54,213 $ 559,553 $ 56,523 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c) (13,046) (13,363) Net amounts $ 41,167 $ 43,160 Notes to consolidated financial statements 190 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 2018 2017 December 31, (in millions) Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables U.S. GAAP nettable derivative payables Interest rate contracts: OTC $ 233,404 $ (228,369) $ 5,035 $ 276,960 $ (271,294) $ 5,666 OTC–cleared 7,163 (6,494) 669 6,004 (5,928) 76 Exchange-traded(a) 210 (135) 75 127 (84) 43 Total interest rate contracts 240,777 (234,998) 5,779 283,091 (277,306) 5,785 Credit contracts: OTC 13,412 (11,895) 1,517 16,194 (15,170) 1,024 OTC–cleared 6,716 (6,714) 2 6,801 (6,784) 17 Total credit contracts 20,128 (18,609) 1,519 22,995 (21,954) 1,041 Foreign exchange contracts: OTC 160,930 (152,161) 8,769 150,966 (141,789) 9,177 OTC–cleared 274 (268) 6 1,555 (1,553) 2 Exchange-traded(a) 16 (3) 13 98 (7) 91 Total foreign exchange contracts 161,220 (152,432) 8,788 152,619 (143,349) 9,270 Equity contracts: OTC 29,437 (25,544) 3,893 28,193 (23,969) 4,224 Exchange-traded(a) 16,285 (15,490) 795 12,720 (12,234) 486 Total equity contracts 45,722 (41,034) 4,688 40,913 (36,203) 4,710 Commodity contracts: OTC 8,930 (4,838) 4,092 7,697 (e) (5,508) 2,189 (e) Exchange-traded(a) 8,259 (8,208) 51 8,870 (8,709) 161 Total commodity contracts 17,189 (13,046) 4,143 16,567 (e) (14,217) 2,350 (e) Derivative payables with appropriate legal opinion 485,036 (460,119) 24,917 (d) 516,185 (e) (493,029) 23,156 (d)(e) Derivative payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained 16,852 16,852 14,621 (e) 14,621 (e) Total derivative payables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets $ 501,888 $ 41,769 $ 530,806 $ 37,777 Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c) (4,449) (4,180) Net amounts $ 37,320 $ 33,597 (a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.

For some counterparties, the collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty. (c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $55.2 billion and $55.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $43.3 billion and $45.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments. (e) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 191 Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk. The amount of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets is the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 9,396 $ 11,916 Collateral posted 8,907 9,973 The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), at December 31, 2018 and 2017, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract. Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives 2018 2017 December 31, (in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a) $ 76 $ 947 $ 79 $ 1,989 Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b) 172 764 320 650 (a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. (b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at December 31, 2018 was not material, and there were no such transfers at December 31, 2017. Notes to consolidated financial statements 192 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. Fair value hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. (c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. (d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (e) Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. (f) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Under the new hedge accounting guidance, the initial amount of the excluded components may be amortized into income over the life of the derivative, or changes in fair value may be recognized in current period earnings. (g) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 193 As of December 31, 2018, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Given the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. (b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. The carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is $14.6 billion and for long-term debt is $7.3 billion. (c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. (d) Represents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date. Notes to consolidated financial statements 194 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Cash flow hedge gains and losses The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item. Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ 44 $ (44) $ (88) Foreign exchange(b) (26) (201) (175) Total $ 18 $ (245) $ (263) Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Year ended December 31, 2017 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI(c) Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (17) $ 12 $ 29 Foreign exchange(b) (117) 135 252 Total $ (134) $ 147 $ 281 Derivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss) Year ended December 31, 2016 (in millions) Amounts reclassified from AOCI to income Amounts recorded in OCI(c) Total change in OCI for period Contract type Interest rate(a) $ (74) $ (55) $ 19 Foreign exchange(b) (286) (395) (109) Total $ (360) $ (450) $ (90) (a) Primarily consists of benchmark interest rate hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. (b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense. (c) Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges during 2017 and 2016. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016. Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(74) million (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2018, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately six years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately six years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 195 Net investment hedge gains and losses The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 2018 2017 2016 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b) Amounts recorded in OCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI(d) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)(c) Amounts recorded in OCI(d) Foreign exchange derivatives $11 $1,219 $(152) $(1,244) $(280) $262 (a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in fair value of these amounts directly in other income. (b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. For additional information, refer to Note 23. (c) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (d) Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on net investment hedges directly in income during 2017 and 2016. Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposes The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.

(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. (d) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. Credit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives. Notes to consolidated financial statements 196 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Credit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 197 The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value. (d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 198 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. Contracts in the scope of ASC 606 are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known. The adoption of the revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018, required gross presentation of certain costs previously offset against revenue, predominantly associated with certain distribution costs (previously offset against asset management, administration and commissions), with the remainder associated with certain underwriting costs (previously offset against investment banking fees). Adoption of the guidance did not result in any material changes in the timing of revenue recognition. This guidance was adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised, which resulted in an increase in both noninterest revenue and noninterest expense. The Firm did not apply any practical expedients. For additional information, refer to Note 1. Investment banking fees This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria. The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Underwriting Equity $ 1,684 $ 1,466 $ 1,200 Debt 3,347 3,802 3,277 Total underwriting 5,031 5,268 4,477 Advisory 2,519 2,144 2,095 Total investment banking fees $ 7,550 $ 7,412 $ 6,572 Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 31 for segment results. Principal transactions Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of the realized (as a result of the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client- driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives. For further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities, refer to Note 5. In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients. The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven market- making activities. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm’s client- driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 199 Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Trading revenue by instrument type Interest rate $ 1,961 $ 2,479 $ 2,325 Credit 1,395 1,329 2,096 Foreign exchange 3,222 2,746 2,827 Equity 4,924 3,873 2,994 Commodity 906 661 1,067 Total trading revenue 12,408 11,088 11,309 Private equity gains (349) 259 257 Principal transactions $ 12,059 $ 11,347 $ 11,566 Principal transactions revenue is earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 31 for segment results. Lending- and deposit-related fees Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Deposit- related fees include fees earned in lieu of compensating balances, and fees earned from performing cash management activities and other deposit account services. Lending- and deposit-related fees in this revenue category are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Lending-related fees $ 1,117 $ 1,110 $ 1,114 Deposit-related fees 4,935 4,823 4,660 Total lending- and deposit-related fees $ 6,052 $ 5,933 $ 5,774 Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, CB, and AWM. Refer to Note 31 for segment results. Asset management, administration and commissions This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services and other products. The Firm manages assets on behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset management activities. Amounts paid to third-party service providers are recorded in professional and outside services expense. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Asset management fees Investment management fees(a) $ 10,768 $ 10,434 $ 9,636 All other asset management fees(b) 270 296 338 Total asset management fees 11,038 10,730 9,974 Total administration fees(c) 2,179 2,029 1,915 Commissions and other fees Brokerage commissions(d) 2,505 2,239 2,151 All other commissions and fees 1,396 1,289 1,324 Total commissions and fees 3,901 3,528 3,475 Total asset management, administration and commissions $ 17,118 $ 16,287 $ 15,364 (a) Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firm’s clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. (b) The Firm receives other asset management fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, including commissions earned on sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/ or investor redemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the fund or upon investor redemption. (c) The Firm receives administrative fees predominantly from custody, securities lending, fund services and securities clearance services it provides. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period in which the related service is provided. (d) The Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net against commission revenue. Asset management, administration and commissions are earned primarily by AWM, CIB, CCB, and CB. Refer to Note 31 for segment results. Mortgage fees and related income This revenue category primarily reflects CCB’s Home Lending net production and net mortgage servicing revenue. Net production revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell; the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans; and changes in the fair value of any residual interests held from mortgage securitizations. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans, lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale, changes in fair value on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell and measured at fair value under the fair value option, as well as losses recognized as incurred related to the repurchase of previously sold loans. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided, changes in the fair value of MSRs and the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs. For further discussion of risk management activities and MSRs, refer to Note 15. Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 200 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Card income This revenue category includes interchange income from credit and debit cards and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Certain Chase credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income. Credit card revenue sharing agreements The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co- brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co- brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co- brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years. The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned. The following table presents the components of card income: Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Interchange and merchant processing income $ 18,808 $ 17,080 $ 15,367 Reward costs and partner payments (13,074) (b) (10,820) (9,480) Other card income(a) (745) (1,827) (1,108) Total card income $ 4,989 $ 4,433 $ 4,779 (a) Predominantly represents annual fees and new account origination costs, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period and are outside the scope of the revenue recognition guidance, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. (b) Includes an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately $330 million, recorded in the second quarter of 2018. Card income is earned primarily by CCB and CB. Refer to Note 31 for segment results.

(b) Represents securities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. (c) Negative interest income is related to client-driven demand for certain securities combined with the impact of low interest rates. This is matched book activity and the negative interest expense on the corresponding securities loaned is recognized in interest expense. (d) Includes held-for-investment margin loans, which are classified in accrued interest and accounts receivable, and all other interest- earning assets, which are classified in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (e) Includes commercial paper. (f) Other interest-bearing liabilities include brokerage customer payables. Interest income and interest expense includes the current- period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. For further information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to loans, investment securities, securities financing (i.e. securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities loaned) and long-term debt, refer to Notes 12, 10, 11 and 19, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 202 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. is a qualified noncontributory plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. In connection with changes to the U.S. Retirement Savings Program during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Firm announced that it will freeze the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Commencing on January 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019 for new hires), pay credits will be directed to the U.S. defined contribution plan. Interest credits will continue to accrue. As a result, a curtailment was triggered and a remeasurement of the U.S. defined benefit pension obligation and plan assets occurred as of November 30, 2018. The plan design change resulted in an increase to pension expense of $21 million representing the immediate recognition of the prior service cost, but did not have a material impact on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan or the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also has defined benefit pension plans that are offered in certain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It is the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate at this time any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2019. The 2019 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be $45 million of which $30 million are contractually required. The Firm also has a number of nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that are unfunded. These plans provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain employees. The Firm offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. retirees and postretirement medical benefits to qualifying U.S. and U.K. employees. The Firm defrays the cost of its U.S. OPEB obligation through corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. The Firm has generally funded its postretirement benefit obligations through contributions to the relevant trust on a pay-as-you go basis. On December 21, 2017, the Firm contributed $600 million of cash to the trust as a prefunding of a portion of its postretirement benefit obligations. The U.K. OPEB plan is unfunded. Pension and OPEB accounting generally requires that the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation be measured and recorded on the balance sheet. Plans that are overfunded (excess of plan assets over benefit obligation) are recorded in other assets and plans that are underfunded (excess benefit obligation over plan assets) are recorded within other liabilities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the value of plan assets are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods as discussed in the Gains and losses section of this Note. Additionally, income statement items related to pension and OPEB plans (other than benefits earned during the period) are aggregated and reported net within other expense. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 203 The following table presents the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the pretax pension and OPEB amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and the weighted-average actuarial annualized assumptions for the projected and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.

(c) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, defined benefit pension plan amounts that were not measured at fair value included $340 million and $377 million, respectively, of accrued receivables, and $503 million and $587 million, respectively, of accrued liabilities, for U.S. plans. (d) Represents plans with an aggregate overfunded balance of $5.1 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and plans with an aggregate underfunded balance of $547 million and $612 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (e) For pension plans with a projected benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets was $1.3 billion and $762 million at December 31, 2018, respectively and $1.4 billion and $811 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. For pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets was $1.3 billion and $762 million at December 31, 2018, respectively, and $1.4 billion and $811 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. For OPEB plans with a projected benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the projected benefit obligation was $26 million and $32 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, they had no plan assets. (f) For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the discount rate assumption is 4.30% and 3.70% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the rate of compensation increase and the interest crediting rate are 2.30% and 4.90%, respectively, for both 2018 and 2017. (g) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the gain/(loss) was primarily attributable to the change in the discount rate. (h) Includes an unfunded postretirement benefit obligation of $26 million and $32 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the U.K. plan. Notes to consolidated financial statements 204 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Gains and losses For the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the PBO or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently eight years and for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. In addition, prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan when the prior service cost is first recognized. Due to the curtailment of the principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2018, all related prior service cost was recognized in the annual net periodic benefit cost. For the Firm’s OPEB plans, a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a five-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. This value is referred to as the market-related value of assets. Amortization of net gains and losses, adjusted for gains and losses not yet recognized, is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets. Any excess net gain or loss is amortized over the average expected lifetime of retired participants, which is currently eleven years; however, prior service costs resulting from plan changes are amortized over the average years of service remaining to full eligibility age, which is currently one year. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 205 The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and the weighted-average annualized actuarial assumptions for the net periodic benefit cost.

(c) The rate assumptions for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans are at the upper end of the range, except for the rate of compensation increase, which is 2.30% for both 2018 and 2017, and 3.50% for 2016. Plan assumptions The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return for defined benefit pension and OPEB plan assets is a blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long-term returns for the various asset classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. Consideration is also given to current market conditions and the short-term portfolio mix of each plan. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans was provided by the Firm’s actuaries. This rate was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. The discount rate for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan represents a rate of appropriate duration from the analysis of yield curves provided by the Firm’s actuaries. At December 31, 2018, the Firm increased the discount rates used to determine its benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans in light of current Notes to consolidated financial statements 206 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K market interest rates, which will decrease expense by approximately $20 million in 2019. The 2019 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets and U.S. OPEB plan assets are 5.50% and 4.30%, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the interest crediting rate assumption was 4.90%. The following table represents the effect of a 25-basis point decline in the two listed rates below on estimated 2019 defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense, as well as the effect on the postretirement benefit obligations. (in millions) Defined benefit pension and OPEB plan expense Benefit obligation Expected long-term rate of return $ 51 NA Discount rate $ 50 $ 490 Investment strategy and asset allocation The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The trust- owned assets of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested primarily in fixed income securities. COLI policies used to defray the cost of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity and fixed income indices. The investment policies for the assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of each plan using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. Investments held by the plans include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investment instruments. Additionally, the investments in each of the collective investment funds and/ or registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018, assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include JPMorgan Chase common stock, except through indirect exposures through investments in third-party stock-index funds. The plans hold investments in funds that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $3.7 billion and $6.0 billion, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 207 The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation of the fair values of total plan assets at December 31 for the years indicated, as well as the respective approved asset allocation ranges by asset class.

(d) Other consists primarily of mutual funds, money market funds and participating and non-participating annuity contracts. Mutual funds and money market funds are primarily classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy given they are valued using market observable prices. Participating and non-participating annuity contracts are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to a lack of market mechanisms for transferring each policy and surrender restrictions.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2018, 86 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2022. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Generally, RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding and, as such, are considered participating securities as discussed in Note 22. In January 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Firm’s Board of Directors approved the grant of performance share units (“PSUs”) to members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program for performance years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. The awards vest and are converted into shares of common stock in the quarter after the end of the performance period, which is generally three years. In addition, dividends are notionally reinvested in the Firm’s common stock and will be delivered only in respect of any earned shares. Once the PSUs have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, typically for a total combined vesting and holding period of five years from the grant date. Under the LTI Plans, stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date. The Firm periodically grants employee stock options to individual employees. There were no material grants of stock options or SARs in 2018, 2017 and 2016. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. Notes to consolidated financial statements 210 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K RSUs, PSUs, employee stock options and SARs activity Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for employee stock options and SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, employee stock options and SARs activity for 2018. RSUs/PSUs Options/SARs Year ended December 31, 2018 Number of units Weighted- average grant date fair value Number of awards Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining contractual life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in thousands, except weighted-average data, and where otherwise stated) Outstanding, January 1 72,733 $ 66.36 17,493 $ 40.76 Granted 20,489 110.46 46 113.63 Exercised or vested (32,277) 58.97 (5,054) 39.65 Forfeited (2,136) 84.60 (1) 112.25 Canceled NA NA (21) 45.75 Outstanding, December 31 58,809 $ 85.04 12,463 $ 41.46 2.4 $ 702,815 Exercisable, December 31 NA NA 12,449 41.37 2.4 702,815 The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was $3.6 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was $370 million, $651 million and $338 million, respectively. Compensation expense The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee share-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Cost of prior grants of RSUs, PSUs and SARs that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 1,241 $ 1,125 $ 1,046 Accrual of estimated costs of share- based awards to be granted in future periods including those to full-career eligible employees 1,081 945 894 Total noncash compensation expense related to employee share-based incentive plans $ 2,322 $ 2,070 $ 1,940 At December 31, 2018, approximately $704 million (pretax) of compensation expense related to unvested awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards to employees. Cash flows and tax benefits Effective January 1, 2016, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payments. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, all excess tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) on share-based payment awards are recognized within income tax expense in the Consolidated statements of income. Income tax benefits related to share-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $916 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the cash received from the exercise of stock options under all share-based incentive arrangements, and the actual income tax benefit related to tax deductions from the exercise of the stock options.

Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At December 31, 2018, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody’s). AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments, are reported as net increases or decreases to AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM debt securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM debt securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, as a result of the adoption of the premium amortization accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018, premiums on purchased callable debt securities must be amortized to the earliest call date for debt securities with call features that are explicit, noncontingent and callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. The guidance primarily impacts obligations of U.S. states and municipalities held in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. For additional information, refer to Note 23. As permitted by the new hedge accounting guidance, the Firm also elected to transfer U.S. government agency MBS, commercial MBS, and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $22.4 billion from HTM to AFS in the first quarter of 2018. The transfer of these investment securities resulted in the recognition of a net pretax unrealized gain of $221 million within AOCI. This transfer was a noncash transaction. For additional information, refer to Notes 1, 5 and 23. The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated. 2018 2017 December 31, (in millions) Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Amortized cost Gross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair value Available-for-sale securities Mortgage-backed securities: U.S. government agencies(a) $ 69,026 $ 594 $ 974 $ 68,646 $ 69,879 $ 736 $ 335 $ 70,280 Residential: U.S 5,877 79 31 5,925 8,193 185 14 8,364 Non-U.S. 2,529 72 6 2,595 2,882 122 1 3,003 Commercial 6,758 43 147 6,654 4,932 98 5 5,025 Total mortgage-backed securities 84,190 788 1,158 83,820 85,886 1,141 355 86,672 U.S. Treasury and government agencies 55,771 366 78 56,059 22,510 266 31 22,745 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 36,221 1,582 80 37,723 30,490 1,881 33 32,338 Certificates of deposit 75 — — 75 59 — — 59 Non-U.S. government debt securities 23,771 351 20 24,102 26,900 426 32 27,294 Corporate debt securities 1,904 23 9 1,918 2,657 101 1 2,757 Asset-backed securities: Collateralized loan obligations 19,612 1 176 19,437 20,928 69 1 20,996 Other 7,225 57 22 7,260 8,764 77 24 8,817 Total available-for-sale debt securities 228,769 3,168 1,543 230,394 198,194 3,961 477 201,678 Available-for-sale equity securities(b) — — — — 547 — — 547 Total available-for-sale securities 228,769 3,168 1,543 230,394 198,741 3,961 477 202,225 Held-to-maturity securities Mortgage-backed securities U.S. government agencies(c) 26,610 134 200 26,544 27,577 558 40 28,095 Commercial — — — — 5,783 1 74 5,710 Total mortgage-backed securities 26,610 134 200 26,544 33,360 559 114 33,805 Obligations of U.S. states and municipalities 4,824 105 15 4,914 14,373 554 80 14,847 Total held-to-maturity securities 31,434 239 215 31,458 47,733 1,113 194 48,652 Total investment securities $ 260,203 $ 3,407 $ 1,758 $ 261,852 $ 246,474 $ 5,074 $ 671 $ 250,877 Notes to consolidated financial statements 212 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K (a) Includes total U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations with fair values of $50.7 billion and $45.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.

The Firm considers a decline in fair value to be other-than- temporary when the Firm does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. For AFS debt securities, the Firm recognizes OTTI losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In these circumstances the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in OCI. Factors considered in evaluating potential OTTI include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and the Firm’s intent and ability to hold the security until recovery. The Firm’s cash flow evaluations take into account the factors noted above and expectations of relevant market and economic data as of the end of the reporting period. When assessing securities issued in a securitization for OTTI, the Firm estimates cash flows considering underlying loan- level data and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. The Firm also performs other analyses to support its cash flow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios. For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm considers an impairment to be other- than-temporary when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. Notes to consolidated financial statements 214 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K As a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance in the first quarter of 2018, equity securities are no longer permitted to be classified as AFS. For additional information, refer to Note 1. Additionally, the Firm did not recognize any OTTI for AFS equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Firm recognized $22 million of unrealized losses as OTTI on securities it intended to sell and subsequently sold during the year. The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of December 31, 2018, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Further, the Firm did not recognize any credit-related OTTI losses during the year ended December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the Firm believes that the investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of December 31, 2018, are not other-than- temporarily impaired. Investment securities gains and losses The following table presents realized gains and losses and OTTI from AFS securities that were recognized in income. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Realized gains $ 211 $ 1,013 $ 401 Realized losses (606) (1,072) (232) OTTI losses — (7) (28) Net investment securities gains/ (losses) (395) (66) 141 OTTI losses Credit-related losses recognized in income — — (1) Investment securities the Firm intends to sell(a) — (7) (27) Total OTTI losses recognized in income $ — $ (7) $ (28) (a) Excludes realized losses on securities sold of $22 million, $6 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that had been previously reported as an OTTI loss due to the intention to sell the securities. Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities The cumulative credit loss component, including any changes therein, of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS securities was not material as of and during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

(b) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. (c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted- average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 7 years for agency residential MBS, 3 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 2 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. Notes to consolidated financial statements 216 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 11 – Securities financing activities JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements are generally carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. For further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, refer to Note 1. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. For further information regarding the fair value option, refer to Note 3. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, refer to Note 28. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices with respect to resale and securities borrowed agreements as described above, the Firm did not hold any reserves for credit impairment with respect to these agreements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 217 The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces the economic exposure with the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented below, if the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented. 2018 December 31, (in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets(b) Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(c) Net amounts(d) Assets Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 691,116 $ (369,612) $ 321,504 $ (308,854) $ 12,650 Securities borrowed 132,955 (20,960) 111,995 (79,747) 32,248 Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 541,587 $ (369,612) $ 171,975 $ (149,125) $ 22,850 Securities loaned and other(a) 33,700 (20,960) 12,740 (12,358) 382 2017 December 31, (in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets(b) Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(c) Net amounts(d) Assets Securities purchased under resale agreements $ 448,608 $ (250,505) $ 198,103 $ (188,502) $ 9,601 Securities borrowed 113,926 (8,814) 105,112 (76,805) 28,307 Liabilities Securities sold under repurchase agreements $ 398,218 $ (250,505) $ 147,713 $ (129,178) $ 18,535 Securities loaned and other(a) 27,228 (8,814) 18,414 (18,151) 263 (a) Includes securities-for-securities lending agreements of $3.3 billion and $9.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender. These amounts are presented within accounts payable and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets. (b) Includes securities financing agreements accounted for at fair value. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, included securities purchased under resale agreements of $13.2 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively; securities sold under repurchase agreements of $935 million and $697 million, respectively; and securities borrowed of $5.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. There were no securities loaned accounted for at fair value in either period. (c) In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty. In such cases, the amounts reported in this column are limited to the related net asset or liability with that counterparty. (d) Includes securities financing agreements that provide collateral rights, but where an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement has not been either sought or obtained. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, included $7.9 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, of securities purchased under resale agreements; $30.3 billion and $25.5 billion, respectively, of securities borrowed; $21.5 billion and $16.5 billion, respectively, of securities sold under repurchase agreements; and $25 million and $29 million, respectively, of securities loaned and other.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Firm held $701 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 219 Note 12 – Loans Loan accounting framework The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit- impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value • PCI loans held-for-investment The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories: Loans held-for-investment (other than PCI loans) Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. Interest income Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full. The Firm separately establishes an allowance, which reduces loans and is charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income on credit card loans. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the recorded investment to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs Consumer loans, other than risk-rated business banking and auto loans, and PCI loans, are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans and non-modified credit card loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due. Certain consumer loans will be charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge- off standards in certain circumstances as follows: • Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on government- guaranteed loans. Notes to consolidated financial statements 220 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Wholesale loans, risk-rated business banking loans and risk- rated auto loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized, including situations where a loan is determined to be both impaired and collateral- dependent. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the estimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every twelve months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state- specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Held-for-sale loans are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Held-for-sale loans are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Because held-for-sale loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. Loans at fair value Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. PCI loans PCI loans held-for-investment are initially measured at fair value. PCI loans have evidence of credit deterioration since the loan’s origination date and therefore it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Because PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes an estimate of future credit losses, no allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans is recorded at the acquisition date. Refer to page 231 of this Note for information on accounting for PCI loans subsequent to their acquisition. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 221 Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, refer to Note 13. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss-mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower- specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired until it matures, is repaid, or is otherwise liquidated, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms. In certain limited cases, the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is at or above the current market rate at the time of the restructuring. In such circumstances, and assuming that the loan subsequently performs under its modified terms and the Firm expects to collect all contractual principal and interest cash flows, the loan is disclosed as impaired and as a TDR only during the year of the modification; in subsequent years, the loan is not disclosed as an impaired loan or as a TDR so long as repayment of the restructured loan under its modified terms is reasonably assured. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well- defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Because loans modified in TDRs are considered to be impaired, these loans are measured for impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific allowance methodology throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status and/or the loan has been removed from the impaired loans disclosures (i.e., loans restructured at market rates). For further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s asset-specific allowance, refer to Note 13. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. Notes to consolidated financial statements 222 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Loan portfolio The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. Consumer, excluding credit card(a) Credit card Wholesale(f) Residential real estate – excluding PCI • Residential mortgage(b) • Home equity(c) Other consumer loans(d) • Auto • Consumer & Business Banking(e) Residential real estate – PCI • Home equity • Prime mortgage • Subprime mortgage • Option ARMs • Credit card loans • Commercial and industrial • Real estate • Financial institutions • Governments & Agencies • Other(g) (a) Includes loans held in CCB, prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. (b) Predominantly includes prime (including option ARMs) and subprime loans. (c) Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans. (d) Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans that apply the wholesale methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes. (e) Predominantly includes Business Banking loans. (f) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes prime mortgage and home equity loans held in AWM and prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions. (g) Includes loans to: individuals and individual entities (predominantly consists of Wealth Management clients within AWM and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts), SPEs and Private education and civic organizations. For more information on SPEs, refer to Note 14. The following tables summarize the Firm’s loan balances by portfolio segment.

(b) Loans (other than PCI loans and those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 223 The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held- for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions. The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table. 2018 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 2,543 (a)(b) $ — $ 2,354 $ 4,897 Sales 9,984 — 16,741 26,725 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 36 — 2,276 2,312 2017 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 3,461 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,799 $ 5,260 Sales 3,405 — 11,063 14,468 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 6,340 (c) — 1,229 7,569 2016 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total Purchases $ 4,116 (a)(b) $ — $ 1,448 $ 5,564 Sales 6,368 — 8,739 15,107 Retained loans reclassified to held-for-sale 321 — 2,381 2,702 (a) Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA. (b) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $18.6 billion, $23.5 billion and $30.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (c) Includes the Firm’s student loan portfolio which was sold in 2017. Gains and losses on sales of loans Gains and losses on sales of loans (including adjustments to record loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in other income were not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses. Notes to consolidated financial statements 224 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization. The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. In 2017, the Firm sold its student loan portfolio. December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Residential real estate – excluding PCI Residential mortgage $ 231,078 $ 216,496 Home equity 28,340 33,450 Other consumer loans Auto 63,573 66,242 Consumer & Business Banking 26,612 25,789 Residential real estate – PCI Home equity 8,963 10,799 Prime mortgage 4,690 6,479 Subprime mortgage 1,945 2,609 Option ARMs 8,436 10,689 Total retained loans $ 373,637 $ 372,553 Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, including both non-PCI and PCI portfolios, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit-quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660 ) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score. • For scored auto and scored business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events. • Risk-rated business banking and auto loans are similar to wholesale loans in that the primary credit quality indicators are the risk rating that is assigned to the loan and whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information about borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations. For further information about risk-rated wholesale loan credit quality indicators, refer to page 236 of this Note.

(b) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, residential mortgage loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $4.1 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. (c) These balances, which are 90 days or more past due, were excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, these balances included $999 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed reimbursement rate. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2018 and 2017. (d) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (e) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. (f) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2018. (g) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $6.9 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee. Notes to consolidated financial statements 226 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Approximately 37% of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table provides the Firm’s delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Total loans Total 30+ day delinquency rate December 31, (in millions except ratios) 2018 2017 2018 2017 HELOCs:(a) Within the revolving period(b) $ 5,608 $ 6,363 0.25% 0.50% Beyond the revolving period 11,286 13,532 2.80 3.56 HELOANs 1,030 1,371 2.82 3.50 Total $ 17,924 $ 21,266 2.00% 2.64% (a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period. (b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans The table below provides information about the Firm’s residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 13.

The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2018, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 13% of residential mortgages and approximately 9% of home equity that were 30 days or more past due. (b) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $4.1 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure. (c) Predominantly all residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, are in the U.S. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. (e) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, nonaccrual loans included $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. For additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status, refer to the Loan accounting framework on pages 219-221 of this Note.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm.

Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications. (b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Also includes forbearances that meet the definition of a TDR for the year ended December 31, 2018. Forbearances suspend or reduce monthly payments for a specific period of time to address a temporary hardship. Notes to consolidated financial statements 228 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and does not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last 12 months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels. At December 31, 2018, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years for residential mortgage and 8 years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). Active and suspended foreclosure At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $653 million and $787 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(c) For risk-rated business banking and auto loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the risk rating of the loan, including whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. Notes to consolidated financial statements 230 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Other consumer impaired loans and loan modifications The following table provides information about the Firm’s other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.

This typically occurs when the impaired loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance. (b) Predominantly all other consumer impaired loans are in the U.S. (c) Other consumer average impaired loans were $275 million, $427 million and $635 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The related interest income on impaired loans, including those on a cash basis, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. (d) Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors, including charge-offs, interest payments received and applied to the principal balance, net deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans. Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, other consumer loans modified in TDRs were $79 million and $102 million, respectively. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were not material. TDRs on nonaccrual status were $57 million and $72 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 231 Purchased credit-impaired loans PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value at acquisition. PCI loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter may be aggregated into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. All of the Firm’s residential real estate PCI loans were acquired in the same fiscal quarter and aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics. On a quarterly basis, the Firm estimates the total cash flows (both principal and interest) expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool. These estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect then-current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows (i.e., increased credit losses) trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related forgone interest cash flows, discounted at the pool’s effective interest rate. Impairments are recognized through the provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are generally recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income. The Firm continues to modify certain PCI loans. The impact of these modifications is incorporated into the Firm’s quarterly assessment of whether a probable and significant change in expected cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans. In evaluating the effect of modifications on expected cash flows, the Firm incorporates the effect of any forgone interest and also considers the potential for redefault. The Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are used to compute expected credit losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified PCI loans. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the underlying loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not reported on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying pools of loans. Since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for the Firm’s PCI consumer loan pools are reasonably estimable, interest is being accreted and the loan pools are being reported as performing loans. No interest would be accreted and the PCI loan pools would be reported as nonaccrual loans if the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on the loan pools were determined not to be reasonably estimable. The liquidation of PCI loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payment in full from the borrower, or foreclosure, results in removal of the loans from the underlying PCI pool. When the amount of the liquidation proceeds (e.g., cash, real estate), if any, is less than the unpaid principal balance of the loan, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool’s nonaccretable difference for principal losses (i.e., the lifetime credit loss estimate established as a purchase accounting adjustment at the acquisition date). When the nonaccretable difference for a particular loan pool has been fully depleted, any excess of the unpaid principal balance of the loan over the liquidation proceeds is written off against the PCI pool’s allowance for loan losses. Write-offs of PCI loans also include other adjustments, primarily related to principal forgiveness modifications. Because the Firm’s PCI loans are accounted for at a pool level, the Firm does not recognize charge-offs of PCI loans when they reach specified stages of delinquency (i.e., unlike non-PCI consumer loans, these loans are not charged off based on FFIEC standards). The PCI portfolio affects the Firm’s results of operations primarily through: (i) contribution to net interest margin; (ii) expense related to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii) any provision for loan losses. The Firm’s residential real estate PCI loans were funded based on the interest rate characteristics of the loans. For example, variable-rate loans were funded with variable-rate liabilities and fixed-rate loans were funded with fixed-rate liabilities with a similar maturity profile. A net spread will be earned on the declining balance of the portfolio, which is estimated as of December 31, 2018, to have a remaining weighted-average life of 7 years.

(b) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. (c) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.

Substantially all HELOCs are beyond the revolving period. (b) Includes loans modified into fixed rate amortizing loans. The table below presents the accretable yield activity for the Firm’s PCI consumer loans for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and represents the Firm’s estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.

Active and suspended foreclosure At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $964 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. Notes to consolidated financial statements 234 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Credit card loan portfolio The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score calculation. The table below provides information about the Firm’s credit card loans.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 235 Credit card impaired loans and loan modifications The table below provides information about the Firm’s impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs. December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Impaired credit card loans with an allowance(a)(b)(c) $ 1,319 $ 1,215 Allowance for loan losses related to impaired credit card loans 440 383 (a) The carrying value and the unpaid principal balance are the same for credit card impaired loans. (b) There were no impaired loans without an allowance. (c) Predominantly all impaired credit card loans are in the U.S. The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Average impaired credit card loans $ 1,260 $ 1,214 $ 1,325 Interest income on impaired credit card loans 65 59 63 Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit. New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were $866 million, $756 million and $636 million, respectively. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans. Financial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except weighted-average data) 2018 2017 2016 Weighted-average interest rate of loans – before TDR 17.98% 16.58% 15.56% Weighted-average interest rate of loans – after TDR 5.16 4.88 4.76 Loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(a)(b) $ 116 $ 93 $ 74 (a) Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted. (b) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. A substantial portion of these loans are expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be 33.38%, 31.54% and 28.87% as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 236 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Wholesale loan portfolio Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings generally represent ratings profiles similar to those defined by S&P and Moody’s. Investment-grade ratings range from “AAA/Aaa” to “BBB-/Baa3.” Noninvestment-grade ratings are classified as noncriticized (“BB+/Ba1 and B-/B3”) and criticized (“CCC+”/“Caa1 and below”), and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher probability of default than noncriticized loans. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 239 Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolio, which consists of the two consumer portfolio segments (primarily scored) and the wholesale portfolio segment (risk-rated). The allowance for loan losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans, as described below. Management also estimates an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending- related commitments using methodologies similar to those used to estimate the allowance on the underlying loans. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for credit losses are described in the following paragraphs. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in future periods. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of December 31, 2018, JPMorgan Chase deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. Formula-based component The formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation to provide for incurred credit losses in all consumer loans and performing risk-rated loans. All loans restructured in TDRs as well as any impaired risk-rated loans have an allowance assessed as part of the asset- specific component, while PCI loans have an allowance assessed as part of the PCI component. Refer to Note 12 for more information on TDRs, Impaired loans and PCI loans. Formula-based component - Consumer loans and certain lending-related commitments The formula-based allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio segments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and loss severities) to the recorded investment balances or loan- equivalent amounts of pools of loan exposures with similar risk characteristics over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. In addition, management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for each loan portfolio category, using delinquency trends and other risk characteristics to estimate the total incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Management uses additional statistical methods and considers actual portfolio performance, including actual losses recognized on defaulted loans and collateral valuation trends, to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical loss estimate. The economic impact of potential modifications of residential real estate loans is not included in the statistical calculation because of the uncertainty regarding the type and results of such modifications. The statistical calculation is then adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. However, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the statistical calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the statistical calculation, are subject to management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses for the consumer credit portfolio. Overall, the allowance for credit losses for consumer portfolios is sensitive to changes in the economic environment (e.g., unemployment rates), delinquency rates, the realizable value of collateral (e.g., housing prices), FICO scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors. While all of these factors are important determinants of overall allowance levels, changes in the various factors may not occur at the same time or at the same rate, or changes may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in another. In addition, changes in these factors would not necessarily be consistent across all geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predict the extent to which changes in these factors would ultimately affect the frequency of losses, the severity of losses or both. Notes to consolidated financial statements 240 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Formula-based component - Wholesale loans and lending- related commitments The Firm’s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating. The formula-based component of the allowance for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the recorded investment balances or loan-equivalent over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by the funded versus unfunded status of the instrument and may change over time. The Firm assesses the credit quality of a borrower or counterparty and assigns a risk rating. Risk ratings are assigned at origination or acquisition, and if necessary, adjusted for changes in credit quality over the life of the exposure. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan or lending-related commitment, among the factors considered are the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Determining risk ratings involves significant judgment; emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could affect the risk rating assigned by the Firm. A PD estimate is determined based on the Firm’s history of defaults over more than one credit cycle. LGD estimate is a judgment-based estimate assigned to each loan or lending-related commitment. The estimate represents the amount of economic loss if the obligor were to default. The type of obligor, quality of collateral, and the seniority of the Firm’s lending exposure in the obligor’s capital structure affect LGD. The Firm applies judgment in estimating PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent used in calculating the allowance for credit losses. Estimates of PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent used are subject to periodic refinement based on any changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Changes to the time period used for PD and LGD estimates could also affect the allowance for credit losses. The use of different inputs, estimates or methodologies could change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by the Firm. In addition to the statistical credit loss estimates applied to the wholesale portfolio, management applies its judgment to adjust the statistical estimates for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments, taking into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss factors. Historical experience of both LGD and PD are considered when estimating these adjustments. Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated where relevant. These estimates are based on management’s view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic conditions, quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio. Asset-specific component The asset-specific component of the allowance relates to loans considered to be impaired, which includes loans that have been modified in TDRs as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger risk-rated loans (primarily loans in the wholesale portfolio segment) are evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both risk- rated and scored) are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are reported as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. In certain cases, the asset-specific allowance is determined using an observable market price, and the allowance is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan’s fair value. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. For any of these impaired loans, the amount of the asset-specific allowance required to be recorded, if any, is dependent upon the recorded investment in the loan (including prior charge-offs), and either the expected cash flows or fair value of collateral. Refer to Note 12 for more information about charge-offs and collateral-dependent loans. The asset-specific component of the allowance for impaired loans that have been modified in TDRs (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions) incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows, which considers the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 241 Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors, including the level of future home prices. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. PCI loans In connection with the acquisition of certain PCI loans, which are accounted for as described in Note 12, the allowance for loan losses for the PCI portfolio is based on quarterly estimates of the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated remaining lives of the loans. These cash flow projections are based on estimates regarding default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. These estimates are dependent on assumptions regarding the level of future home prices, and the duration of current overall economic conditions, among other factors. These estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

Page 198 The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Line of Business Transaction Type Activity 2018 Form 10-K page references CCB Credit card securitization trusts Securitization of originated credit card receivables 244-245 Mortgage securitization trusts Servicing and securitization of both originated and purchased residential mortgages 245-247 CIB Mortgage and other securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgages, and other consumer loans 245-247 Multi-seller conduits Assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner and structures transactions to meet investor needs 247 Municipal bond vehicles Financing of municipal bond investments 247-248 The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows: • Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities. • Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third- party transaction. • Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 249 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties. Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities Credit card securitizations CCB’s Card business securitizes originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm- sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $15.1 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 37% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Firm did JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 245 not retain any senior securities and retained $3.0 billion and $4.5 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. Refer to Securitization activity on page 250 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm’s cash flows associated with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 250-251 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales to U.S. government agencies.

(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions. (e) As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 60% and 61%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests, which are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.3 billion of investment-grade for both periods, and $16 million and $48 million of noninvestment-grade at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitizations trusts consisted of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion of investment-grade and $623 million and $412 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 246 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Residential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. Refer to the table on page 248 of this Note for more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations. The Firm does not consolidate a residential mortgage securitization (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust. Refer to the table on page 248 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations. Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Refer to the table on page 248 of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. Re-securitizations The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both agency (Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”)) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs, which may be backed by either residential or commercial mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts. The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Transfers of securities to VIEs Firm-sponsored private-label $ — $ — $ 647 Agency 15,532 12,617 11,241 Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. In more limited circumstances, the Firm creates a nonagency re-securitization trust independently and not in conjunction with specific clients. In these circumstances, the Firm is deemed to have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust because of the decisions made during the establishment and design of the trust; therefore, the Firm consolidates the re-securitization VIE if the Firm holds an interest that could potentially be significant. Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re- securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 247 The following table presents information on nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs. Nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Firm-sponsored private-label Assets held in VIEs with continuing involvement(a) $ 118 $ 783 Interest in VIEs 10 29 Agency Interest in VIEs 3,058 2,250 (a) Represents the principal amount and includes the notional amount of interest-only securities. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm- sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal- specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal- specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal- specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. Refer to page 248 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities. In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $20.1 billion and $20.4 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm- administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $8.0 billion and $8.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off- balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 27. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party; refer to page 249 on this Note for further information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non- customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, Notes to consolidated financial statements 248 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2018 and 2017. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates Non-Customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. (c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. (d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $13.7 billion and $21.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For additional information on interest-bearing long-term beneficial interests, refer to Note 19. (e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 249 VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s- length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $16.5 billion and $13.4 billion, of which $4.0 billion and $3.2 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 24 for further information on affordable housing tax credits. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 27. Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to Customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain Customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate Customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to Customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $4.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $7.7 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, refer to Note 27. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue. Notes to consolidated financial statements 250 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Securitization activity The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization. 2018 2017 2016 Year ended December 31, (in millions) Residential mortgage(f) Commercial and other(g) Residential mortgage(f) Commercial and other(g) Residential mortgage(f) Commercial and other(g) Principal securitized $ 6,431 $ 10,159 $ 5,532 $ 10,252 $ 1,817 $ 8,964 All cash flows during the period:(a) Proceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments(b)(c) $ 6,449 $ 10,218 $ 5,661 $ 10,340 $ 1,831 $ 9,094 Servicing fees collected(d) 319 2 338 3 477 3 Purchases of previously transferred financial assets (or the underlying collateral)(e) — — 1 — 37 — Cash flows received on interests 411 301 463 918 482 1,441 (a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.

(d) The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (e) Includes cash paid by the Firm to reacquire assets from nonconsolidated entities – for example, loan repurchases due to representation and warranties and servicer “clean-up” calls. (f) Includes prime mortgages only. Excludes certain loan securitization transactions entered into with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (g) Includes commercial mortgage and other consumer loans. Key assumptions used to value retained interests originated during the year are shown in the table below.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 27 for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales and securitization- related indemnifications. Refer to Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 251 The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.

(b) Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans. (c) Gains/(losses) on loan sales include the value of MSRs. (d) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale. Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 27, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 12. The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 252 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 15 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights Goodwill Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed by the Firm’s Operating Committee. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments. December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Consumer & Community Banking $ 30,984 $ 31,013 $ 30,797 Corporate & Investment Bank 6,770 6,776 6,772 Commercial Banking 2,860 2,860 2,861 Asset & Wealth Management 6,857 6,858 6,858 Total goodwill $ 47,471 $ 47,507 $ 47,288 The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.

(b) For 2016, represents AWM goodwill, which was disposed of as part of a sale. (c) Includes foreign currency remeasurement and other adjustments. Goodwill impairment testing The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. In the first step, the current fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then a second step is performed. In the second step, the implied current fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (as determined in step one) to the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. The resulting implied current fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied current fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. If the carrying value of goodwill is less than its implied current fair value, then no goodwill impairment is recognized. The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets capital as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the Firm’s lines of business and takes into consideration capital level of similarly-rated peers and applicable regulatory requirements. Proposed line of business equity levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated capital is further reviewed on a periodic basis and updated as needed. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 253 The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts which are reviewed with senior management of the Firm. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firms’ overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the general reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. Management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units. Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience. Notes to consolidated financial statements 254 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (i.e., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2018 2017 2016 Fair value at beginning of period $ 6,030 $ 6,096 $ 6,608 MSR activity: Originations of MSRs 931 1,103 679 Purchase of MSRs 315 — — Disposition of MSRs(a) (636) (140) (109) Net additions 610 963 570 Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (740) (797) (919) Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions: Changes due to market interest rates and other(b) 300 (202) (72) Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions: Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service) 15 (102) (35) Discount rates 24 (19) 7 Prepayment model changes and other(c) (109) 91 (63) Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions (70) (30) (91) Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions 230 (232) (163) Fair value at December 31, $ 6,130 $ 6,030 $ 6,096 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31, $ 230 $ (232) $ (163) Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 1,778 1,886 2,124 Third-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions) 521.0 555.0 593.3 Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31, (in billions)(d) 3.0 4.0 4.7 (a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. (b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. (c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. (d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 255 The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. December 31, (in millions, except rates) 2018 2017 Weighted-average prepayment speed assumption (“CPR”) 8.78% 9.35% Impact on fair value of 10% adverse change $ (205) $ (221) Impact on fair value of 20% adverse change (397) (427) Weighted-average option adjusted spread 8.70% 9.04% Impact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change $ (235) $ (250) Impact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change (452) (481) CPR: Constant prepayment rate. Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. Notes to consolidated financial statements 256 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 16 – Premises and equipment Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimated useful life of the leased asset. JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 257 Note 19 – Long-term debt JPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in various currencies, predominantly U.S. dollars, with both fixed and variable interest rates. Included in senior and subordinated debt below are various equity-linked or other indexed instruments, which the Firm has elected to measure at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated statements of income, except for unrealized gains/(losses) due to DVA which are recorded in OCI. The following table is a summary of long-term debt carrying values (including unamortized premiums and discounts, issuance costs, valuation adjustments and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by remaining contractual maturity as of December 31, 2018.

The use of these derivative instruments modifies the Firm’s exposure to the contractual interest rates disclosed in the table above. Including the effects of the hedge accounting derivatives, the range of modified rates in effect at December 31, 2018, for total long-term debt was (0.06)% to 8.88%, versus the contractual range of 0.17% to 8.75% presented in the table above. The interest rate ranges shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value. (b) Included long-term debt of $47.7 billion and $63.5 billion secured by assets totaling $207.0 billion and $208.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. (c) Included $54.9 billion and $47.5 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (d) Included $11.2 billion and $10.3 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $37.4 billion and $33.5 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable. (e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $28 million and $45 million accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (f) At December 31, 2018, long-term debt in the aggregate of $138.2 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments. (g) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2018 is $32.4 billion in 2019, $46.7 billion in 2020, $40.0 billion in 2021, $16.3 billion in 2022 and $26.4 billion in 2023. Notes to consolidated financial statements 258 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.28% and 2.87% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 3.64% and 2.56% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including both long-term debt and structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $10.9 billion and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price. Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures On September 10, 2018 the Firm’s last remaining issuer of outstanding trust preferred securities (“issuer trust”) was liquidated, resulting in $475 million of trust preferred securities and $15 million of trust common securities originally issued by the issuer trust being cancelled. The junior subordinated debentures previously held by the trust issuer were distributed pro rata to the holders of the trust preferred and trust common securities. The carrying value of the junior subordinated debt was $659 million as of December 31, 2018. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 259 Note 20 – Preferred stock At December 31, 2018 and 2017, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm, JPMorgan Chase’s preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets.

Each series of preferred stock has a liquidation value and redemption price per share of $10,000, plus accrued but unpaid dividends. On January 24, 2019, the Firm issued $1.85 billion of 6.00% non-cumulative preferred stock, Series EE, and on January 30, 2019, the Firm announced that it will redeem all $925 million of its outstanding 6.70% non-cumulative preferred stock, Series T, on March 1, 2019.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 260 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 21 – Common stock At December 31, 2018 and 2017, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0 billion shares of common stock with a par value of $1 per share. Common shares issued (newly issued or reissuance from treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Total issued – balance at January 1 4,104.9 4,104.9 4,104.9 Treasury – balance at January 1 (679.6) (543.7) (441.4) Repurchase (181.5) (166.6) (140.4) Reissuance: Employee benefits and compensation plans 21.7 24.5 26.0 Warrant exercise 9.4 5.4 11.1 Employee stock purchase plans 0.9 0.8 1.0 Total reissuance 32.0 30.7 38.1 Total treasury – balance at December 31 (829.1) (679.6) (543.7) Outstanding at December 31 3,275.8 3,425.3 3,561.2 There were no warrants to purchase shares of common stock (“Warrants”) outstanding at December 31, 2018, as any Warrants that were not exercised on or before October 29, 2018, have expired. At December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, the Firm had 15.0 million and 24.9 million Warrants outstanding. On June 28, 2018, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s release of its 2018 CCAR results, the Firm’s Board of Directors authorized a $20.7 billion common equity repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, $10.4 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program. This authorization includes shares repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm’s share- based compensation plans. The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. There were no Warrants repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Total number of shares of common stock repurchased 181.5 166.6 140.4 Aggregate purchase price of common stock repurchases $19,983 $15,410 $ 9,082 The Firm from time to time enters into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading “blackout periods.” All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities, refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities, on page 30. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 85 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 261 Note 22 – Earnings per share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method. Dilutive EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock; these unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Accordingly, these RSUs are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS, and are not included as incremental shares in computing dilutive EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information. For each of the periods presented diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Year ended December 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 Basic earnings per share Net income $ 32,474 $ 24,441 $ 24,733 Less: Preferred stock dividends 1,551 1,663 1,647 Net income applicable to common equity 30,923 22,778 23,086 Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 214 211 252 Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 30,709 $ 22,567 $ 22,834 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,396.4 3,551.6 3,658.8 Net income per share $ 9.04 $ 6.35 $ 6.24 Diluted earnings per share Net income applicable to common stockholders $ 30,709 $ 22,567 $ 22,834 Total weighted-average basic shares outstanding 3,396.4 3,551.6 3,658.8 Add: Employee stock options, SARs, warrants and unvested PSUs 17.6 25.2 31.2 Total weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 3,414.0 3,576.8 3,690.0 Net income per share $ 9.00 $ 6.31 $ 6.19 Notes to consolidated financial statements 262 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 23 – Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), fair value changes of excluded components on fair value hedges, cash flow hedging activities, and net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

This guidance requires the portion of the total change in fair value caused by changes in the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA) to be presented separately in OCI; previously these amounts were recognized in net income. (b) Represents the adjustment to AOCI as a result of the new accounting standards adopted in the first quarter of 2018. For additional information, refer to Note 1.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $168 million to other expense related to the liquidation of certain legal entities, $17 million related to net investment hedge losses and $151 million related to cumulative translation adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $25 million to other expense related to the liquidation of a legal entity, $50 million related to net investment hedge gains and $75 million related to cumulative translation adjustments. (c) Represents changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads, which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income.

(e) The pre-tax amount is reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of income. Notes to consolidated financial statements 264 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 24 – Income taxes JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported. Effective tax rate and expense A reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is presented in the following table. Effective tax rate Year ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Statutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0% 35.0% 35.0% Increase/(decrease) in tax rate resulting from: U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit 4.0 2.2 2.4 Tax-exempt income (1.5) (3.3) (3.1) Non-U.S. subsidiary earnings 0.6 (3.1) (a) (1.7) (a) Business tax credits (3.5) (4.2) (3.9) Impact of the TCJA (0.7) 5.4 — Other, net 0.4 (0.1) (0.3) Effective tax rate 20.3% 31.9% 28.4% (a) Predominantly includes earnings of U.K. subsidiaries that were deemed to be reinvested indefinitely through December 31, 2017. Impact of the TCJA 2018 The Firm’s effective tax rate decreased in 2018 due to the TCJA, including the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as well as a $302 million net tax benefit recorded in 2018 resulting from changes in the estimates related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. The change in estimate was recorded under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) and the accounting under SAB 118 is complete. 2017 The Firm’s effective tax rate increased in 2017 driven by a $1.9 billion income tax expense representing the estimated impact of the enactment of the TCJA. The $1.9 billion tax expense was predominantly driven by a deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings and adjustments to the value of certain tax-oriented investments partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of the Firm’s net deferred tax liability. The deemed repatriation of the Firm’s unremitted non-U.S. earnings is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits of each controlled foreign corporation. The calculation resulted in an estimated income tax expense of $3.7 billion. Furthermore, accounting for income taxes requires the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The Firm remeasured its deferred tax asset and liability balances in the fourth quarter of 2017 to the new statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% as well as any federal benefit associated with state and local deferred income taxes. The remeasurement resulted in an estimated income tax benefit of $2.1 billion. Adjustments were also recorded in 2017 to income tax expense for certain tax-oriented investments. These adjustments were driven by changes to affordable housing proportional amortization resulting from the reduction of the federal income tax rate under the TCJA. SAB 118 did not apply to these adjustments. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 265 The components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income were as follows for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Income tax expense/(benefit) Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Current income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal $ 2,854 $ 5,718 $ 2,488 Non-U.S. 2,077 2,400 1,760 U.S. state and local 1,638 1,029 904 Total current income tax expense/ (benefit) 6,569 9,147 5,152 Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) U.S. federal 1,359 2,174 4,364 Non-U.S. (93) (144) (73) U.S. state and local 455 282 360 Total deferred income tax expense/(benefit) 1,721 2,312 4,651 Total income tax expense $ 8,290 $ 11,459 $ 9,803 Total income tax expense includes $54 million, $252 million and $55 million of tax benefits recorded in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, as a result of tax audit resolutions. Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders’ equity. The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stockholders’ equity resulted in an increase of $172 million in 2018, a decrease of $915 million in 2017, and an increase of $925 million in 2016. Results from Non-U.S. earnings The following table presents the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income before income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 U.S. $ 33,052 $ 27,103 $ 26,651 Non-U.S.(a) 7,712 8,797 7,885 Income before income tax expense $ 40,764 $ 35,900 $ 34,536 (a) For purposes of this table, non-U.S. income is defined as income generated from operations located outside the U.S. Prior to December 31, 2017, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings had been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. The Firm is no longer maintaining the indefinite reinvestment assertion on the undistributed earnings of those non-U.S. subsidiaries in light of the enactment of the TCJA. The U.S. federal and state and local income taxes associated with the undistributed and previously untaxed earnings of those non-U.S. subsidiaries was included in the deemed repatriation charge recorded as of December 31, 2017. Affordable housing tax credits The Firm recognized $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $7.9 billion and $7.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Notes to consolidated financial statements 266 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Deferred taxes Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Deferred tax assets Allowance for loan losses $ 3,433 $ 3,395 Employee benefits 1,129 688 Accrued expenses and other 2,701 3,528 Non-U.S. operations 629 327 Tax attribute carryforwards 163 219 Gross deferred tax assets 8,055 8,157 Valuation allowance (89) (46) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 7,966 $ 8,111 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation and amortization $ 2,533 $ 2,299 Mortgage servicing rights, net of hedges 2,586 2,757 Leasing transactions 4,719 3,483 Non-U.S. operations — 200 Other, net 3,713 3,502 Gross deferred tax liabilities 13,551 12,241 Net deferred tax (liabilities)/assets $ (5,585) $ (4,130) JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $163 million at December 31, 2018, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and state and local capital loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2018, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were approximately $423 million, non- U.S. NOL carryforwards were approximately $120 million and state and local capital loss carryforwards were $1.3 billion. If not utilized, the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire between 2022 and 2036 and the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire between 2020 and 2022. Certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2028 and 2034 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2018, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards. Unrecognized tax benefits At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $4.9 billion, $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, of which $3.8 billion, $3.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits by as much as $0.9 billion. Upon settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result from payment or income statement recognition. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Year ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Balance at January 1, $ 4,747 $ 3,450 $ 3,497 Increases based on tax positions related to the current period 980 1,355 262 Increases based on tax positions related to prior periods 649 626 583 Decreases based on tax positions related to prior periods (1,249) (350) (785) Decreases related to cash settlements with taxing authorities (266) (334) (56) Decreases related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations — — (51) Balance at December 31, $ 4,861 $ 4,747 $ 3,450 After-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $192 million, $102 million and $86 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, in addition to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $887 million and $639 million, respectively, for income tax- related interest and penalties. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 267 Tax examination status JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of significant income tax examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018. December 31, 2018 Periods under examination Status JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2006 – 2010 Field examination of amended returns JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2011 – 2013 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – U.S. 2014 - 2016 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York State 2012 - 2014 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – New York City 2012 - 2014 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – California 2011 – 2012 Field Examination JPMorgan Chase – U.K. 2006 – 2016 Field examination of certain select entities Notes to consolidated financial statements 268 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 25 – Restricted cash, other restricted assets and intercompany funds transfers Restricted cash and other restricted assets Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits. The Federal Reserve requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average required amount of reserve balances is deposited by the Firm’s bank subsidiaries. In addition, the Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks. The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealers (principally J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in the U.S and J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the U.K.) are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets. Upon the adoption of the restricted cash guidance in the first quarter of 2018, restricted and unrestricted cash are reported together on the Consolidated balance sheets and Consolidated statements of cash flows. The following table presents the components of the Firm’s restricted cash: December 31, (in billions) 2018 2017 Cash reserves – Federal Reserve Banks $ 22.1 $ 25.7 Segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers 14.6 16.8 Cash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes 4.1 3.3 Total restricted cash(a) $ 40.8 $ 45.8 (a) Comprises $39.6 billion and $44.8 billion in deposits with banks, and $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Also, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Firm had the following other restricted assets: • Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $20.6 billion and $18.0 billion, respectively. • Securities with a fair value of $9.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity. Intercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk- based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2019, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $10 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2019 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 269 Note 26 – Regulatory capital The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. Capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries. Basel III set forth two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”) and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Certain of the requirements of Basel III were subject to phase-in periods that began on January 1, 2014 and continued through the end of 2018 (“transitional period”). The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below: Under the risk-based and leverage-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table presents the minimum and well- capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2018. Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios BHC(a)(e)(f) IDI(b)(e)(f) BHC(c) IDI(d) Capital ratios CET1 9.0% 6.375% —% 6.5% Tier 1 10.5 7.875 6.0 8.0 Total 12.5 9.875 10.0 10.0 Tier 1 leverage 4.0 4.00 5.0 5.0 SLR 5.0 6.00 — 6.0 Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the Transitional minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 2.5% capital conservation buffer, and 2.625% resulting from the phase in of the Firm’s 3.5% GSIB surcharge. (b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 1.875% resulting from the phase in of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge. (c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. (d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act. (e) For the period ended December 31, 2017 the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 7.5%, 9.0%, 11.0% and 4.0% and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries were 5.75%, 7.25%, 9.25% and 4.0% respectively. (f) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as, supplementary leverage buffers of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 271 Note 27 – Off–balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations. (d) Predominantly all wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S. (e) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $195.6 billion and $188.7 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash and securities issued by governments that are members of G7 and U.S. government agencies. (f) At December 31, 2018, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses. At December 31, 2017 includes commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing houses. (g) Certain guarantees and commitments associated with the Firm’s membership in clearing houses previously disclosed in “other guarantees and commitments” are now disclosed in “Exchange and clearing house guarantees and commitments”. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (h) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, primarily includes letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis, and unfunded commitments related to institutional lending. Additionally, includes unfunded commitments predominantly related to certain tax-oriented equity investments. (i) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative- related products, the carrying value represents the fair value. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 273 Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit. The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank, the Firm in part is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured clearance advance facilities that the Firm extended to its clients (i.e. cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the Firm’s intra-day credit risk to the facility amount and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of December 31, 2017, the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2018 the Firm no longer offers such arrangements to its clients. Guarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For certain types of guarantees, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. For indemnifications provided in sales agreements, a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). Any contingent liability that exists as a result of issuing the guarantee or indemnification is recognized when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable. The contingent portion of the liability is not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of the liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 272. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 274 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Securities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less. Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions. The notional value of derivatives guarantees generally represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount. The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees. The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. (in millions) December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Notional amounts Derivative guarantees $ 55,271 $ 57,174 Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 28,637 29,104 Maximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure 2,963 3,053 Fair value Derivative payables 367 304 Derivative receivables — — In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, refer to Note 5. Unsettled securities financing agreements In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. For a further discussion of securities financing agreements, refer to Note 11. Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expenses. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 275 Private label securitizations The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, refer to Note 29. Loans sold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $30 million and $38 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other off-balance sheet arrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third- party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote. Card charge-backs Under the rules of Visa USA, Inc., and MasterCard International, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is primarily liable for the amount of each processed card sales transaction that is the subject of a dispute between a cardmember and a merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardmember’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardmember’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardmember and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardmember. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or by obtaining other collateral. However, in the unlikely event that: (1) a merchant ceases operations and is unable to deliver products, services or a refund; (2) Merchant Services does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant to provide cardmember refunds; and (3) Merchant Services does not have sufficient financial resources to provide cardmember refunds, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., would recognize the loss. Merchant Services incurred aggregate losses of $30 million, $28 million, and $85 million on $1,366.1 billion, $1,191.7 billion, and $1,063.4 billion of aggregate volume processed for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Incurred losses from merchant charge-backs are charged to other expense, with the offset recorded in a valuation allowance against accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the valuation allowance was $23 million and $7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which the Firm believes, based on historical experience and the collateral held by Merchant Services of $144 million and $141 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is representative of the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs. Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to Notes to consolidated financial statements 276 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. For information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements, refer to Note 5. Exchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 272, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored Member Repo Program In 2018 the Firm commenced the sponsored member repo program, wherein the Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 272. For additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements, refer to Note 11. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 272 of this Note. For additional information, refer to Note 19. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 277 Note 28 – Commitments, pledged assets and collateral Lease commitments At December 31, 2018, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for banking purposes. Certain leases contain renewal options or escalation clauses providing for increased rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, or they require the Firm to perform restoration work on leased premises.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 278 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 29 – Litigation Contingencies As of December 31, 2018, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. American Depositary Receipts Pre-Release Inquiry. In December 2018, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its inquiry into activity relating to pre-released American Depositary Receipts. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX- related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter. The Firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers named as defendants in a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.-based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the “U.S. class action”). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the “exchanged-based actions”), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the “consumer action”), participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the “ERISA actions”), and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the “indirect purchaser action”). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions. The Court granted final approval of that settlement agreement in August 2018. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018 (the “opt-out action”). JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 279 The District Court has dismissed one of the ERISA actions, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that dismissal in July 2018. The second ERISA action was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice in November 2018. The indirect purchaser action, the consumer action and the opt-out action remain pending in the District Court. General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion syndicated Term Loan facility (“Term Loan”) for General Motors Corporation (“GM”). In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (“Creditors Committee”) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s dismissal of the Creditors Committee’s claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court thereafter continued with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims in the Bankruptcy Court against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. seeking indemnification and asserting various claims. In January 2019, the parties reached an agreement in principle to fully resolve the litigation, including the cross- claims filed against the Firm. The agreement is subject to definitive documentation and court approval, and is not expected to have any material impact on the Firm. The Bankruptcy Court has stayed all deadlines in the action to allow the parties to finalize the settlement agreement for submission to the Bankruptcy Court. Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws. The parties settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed the settlement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court’s certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. In March 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined petitions seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement, and the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking preliminary approval of the modified settlement. This settlement provides for the defendants to contribute an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion currently held in escrow from the original settlement. In January 2019, the amended agreement was preliminarily approved by the District Court, and formal notice of the class settlement will proceed in accordance with the District Court’s order. $600 million of the additional amount will be funded from the litigation escrow account established under the Visa defendants’ Retrospective Responsibility Plan, and $300 million will be paid by Mastercard and certain banks in accordance with an agreement among themselves regarding their respective shares. In June 2018, Visa deposited an additional $600 million into its litigation escrow account, which in turn led to a corresponding change in the conversion rate of Visa Class B to Class A shares. Of the Mastercard-related portion, the Firm’s share is approximately $36 million. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (“EC”), the Swiss Competition Commission (“ComCo”) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (“BBA”) in connection with the setting of the BBA’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates was submitted to the European Banking Federation (“EBF”) in connection with the setting of the EBF’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations to the extent that they are ongoing. ComCo’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision Notes to consolidated financial statements 280 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks filed in various United States District Courts, including two putative class actions relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation. The Firm has agreed to settle putative class actions related to exchange-traded Eurodollar futures contracts, Swiss franc LIBOR, EURIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, the Singapore Swap Offer Rate and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate. Those settlements are all subject to further documentation and court approval. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted antitrust claims, claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims to proceed. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. In February 2018, as to those actions which the Firm has not agreed to settle, the District Court (i) granted class certification with respect to certain antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, (ii) denied class certification with respect to state common law claims brought by the holders of those bonds and swaps and (iii) denied class certification with respect to the putative class action related to LIBOR- based loans held by plaintiff lending institutions. Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the “County”) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3.0 billion in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County subsequently filed for bankruptcy and in November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed a Plan of Adjustment pursuant to which the above-described actions against the Firm were released and dismissed with prejudice. Certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment, and that appeal was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The appellants have filed a petition seeking review by the Supreme Court of the United States. Precious Metals Investigations and Litigation. Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the precious metals markets and related conduct. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with these investigations. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain current and former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. The Firm is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver futures in violation of the Sherman Act. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. The Firm has been successful in legal challenges made to the Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, with respect to the criminal proceedings. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and remanded the case to the Court of Appeal to consider JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s application for the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. Any further actions in the criminal proceedings are stayed pending the outcome of that application. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K 281 The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Firm’s legal expense was $72 million, and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, it was a benefit of $(35) million and $(317) million, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period. Notes to consolidated financial statements 282 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Note 30 – International operations The following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 31. The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S. As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions) Revenue(b)(c) Expense(c)(d) Income before income tax expense Net income Total assets 2018 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 16,181 $ 9,953 $ 6,228 $ 4,444 $ 423,835 (e) Asia/Pacific 7,119 4,866 2,253 1,593 171,242 Latin America/Caribbean 2,435 1,413 1,022 718 46,560 Total international 25,735 16,232 9,503 6,755 641,637 North America(a) 83,294 52,033 31,261 25,719 1,980,895 Total $ 109,029 $ 68,265 $ 40,764 $ 32,474 $ 2,622,532 2017 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 15,120 $ 9,347 $ 5,773 $ 4,007 $ 407,145 (e) Asia/Pacific 6,028 4,500 1,528 852 163,718 Latin America/Caribbean 1,994 1,523 471 299 44,569 Total international 23,142 15,370 7,772 5,158 615,432 North America(a) 77,563 49,435 28,128 19,283 1,918,168 Total $ 100,705 $ 64,805 $ 35,900 $ 24,441 $ 2,533,600 2016 Europe/Middle East/Africa $ 14,418 $ 9,126 $ 5,292 $ 3,783 $ 394,134 (e) Asia/Pacific 6,313 4,414 1,899 1,212 156,946 Latin America/Caribbean 1,959 1,632 327 208 42,971 Total international 22,690 15,172 7,518 5,203 594,051 North America(a) 73,879 46,861 27,018 19,530 1,896,921 Total $ 96,569 $ 62,033 $ 34,536 $ 24,733 $ 2,490,972 (a) Substantially reflects the U.S. (b) Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.

Notes to consolidated financial statements 284 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Segment results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. On at least an annual basis, the assumptions and methodologies used in capital allocation are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to lines of business may change. Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards. Certain of the new accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised.

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual average rates (refer to pages 288–292 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The average annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental. 2018 versus 2017 2017 versus 2016 (Unaudited) Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Year ended December 31, (On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) Volume Rate Net change Volume Rate Net change Interest-earning assets Deposits with banks: U.S. $ (1,141) $ 2,751 $ 1,610 $ 409 $ 1,977 $ 2,386 Non-U.S. 59 — 59 18 (45) (27) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements: U.S. 267 800 1,067 (337) 531 194 Non-U.S. 173 252 425 81 (213) (132) Securities borrowed: U.S. 73 633 706 11 264 275 Non-U.S. 26 33 59 (4) 24 20 Trading assets – debt instruments: U.S. 459 423 882 396 (35) 361 Non-U.S. 341 (174) 167 308 (328) (20) Investment securities: U.S. (770) 223 (547) 216 303 519 Non-U.S. (189) 73 (116) (303) (113) (416) Loans: U.S. 1,710 4,246 5,956 2,043 2,286 4,329 Non-U.S. 212 332 544 (110) 211 101 All other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S. 510 1,063 1,573 141 844 985 Change in interest income 1,730 10,655 12,385 2,869 5,706 8,575 Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing deposits: U.S. 244 2,095 2,339 209 985 1,194 Non-U.S. 42 735 777 41 266 307 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements: U.S. 46 1,167 1,213 (83) 659 576 Non-U.S. 5 237 242 54 (108) (54) Trading liabilities – debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing liabilities: (a) U.S. 276 1,842 2,118 45 1,140 1,185 Non-U.S. 180 24 204 (3) 64 61 Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly U.S. (266) 256 (10) (122) 121 (1) Long-term debt: U.S. (618) 1,827 1,209 (176) 1,388 1,212 Non-U.S. 6 10 16 2 (25) (23) Intercompany funding: U.S. (704) (17) (721) 151 (186) (35) Non-U.S. 704 17 721 (151) 186 35 Change in interest expense (85) 8,193 8,108 (33) 4,490 4,457 Change in net interest income $ 1,815 $ 2,462 $ 4,277 $ 2,902 $ 1,216 $ 4,118 Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several new accounting standards.

CLO: Collateralized loan obligations CLTV: Combined loan-to-value Collateral-dependent: A loan is considered to be collateral- dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower’s operations, income or other resources. Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment services to corporate and public sector clients worldwide through the commercial card products. Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions.

The duration of a credit cycle can vary from a couple of years to several years. Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee. Criticized: Criticized loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables that are classified as special mention, substandard and doubtful categories for regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a Glossary of Terms and Acronyms 294 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&P and Moody’s.

LTIP: Long-term incentive plan LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. Origination date LTV ratio The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date. Current estimated LTV ratio An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates. Combined LTV ratio The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products. Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors. Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Measurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. MBS: Mortgage-backed securities MD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis Merchant Services: is a business that primarily processes transactions for merchants. MMDA: Money Market Deposit Accounts Moody’s: Moody’s Investor Services Mortgage origination channels: Glossary of Terms and Acronyms 296 JPMorgan Chase & Co./2018 Form 10-K Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties. Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm. Mortgage product types: Alt-A Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. Option ARMs The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable- rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. Prime Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels.

PCA: Prompt corrective action PCI: “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represents certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with the guidance of the FASB. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics(e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.

ROA: Return on assets ROE: Return on equity ROTCE: Return on tangible common equity RSU(s): Restricted stock units RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk- weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.
