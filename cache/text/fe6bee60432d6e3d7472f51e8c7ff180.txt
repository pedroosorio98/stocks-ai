Business Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&#147;Berkshire,&#148; &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Registrant&#148;) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates a large number of other businesses engaged in a variety of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire&#146;s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by Berkshire&#146;s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Berkshire&#146;s corporate office senior management participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire&#146;s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate &#147;tone at the top&#148; messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employ approximately 367,700 people worldwide. Insurance and Reinsurance Businesses Berkshire&#146;s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance entities. Berkshire&#146;s insurance businesses provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks and also reinsure life, accident and health risks worldwide. In direct insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the reinsurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers have assumed in their own insuring activities. Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by the direct insurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or &#147;retention.&#148; Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers and reinsurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. Insurers based in the United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company&#146;s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as &#147;excess and surplus&#148; lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party&#146;s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. &nbsp; 1 Table of Contents The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#147;NAIC&#148;). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers and reinsurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer&#146;s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. Berkshire&#146;s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels. This strength differentiates Berkshire&#146;s insurance companies from their competitors. Collectively, the aggregate statutory surplus of Berkshire&#146;s U.S. based insurers was approximately $136&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016. Berkshire&#146;s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (&#147;Program&#148;) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December&nbsp;31, 2020 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (the &#147;2015 TRIA Reauthorization&#148;). Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying &#147;acts of terrorism.&#148; In 2017, coverage under TRIA occurs when the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during a calendar year exceeds $140&nbsp;million. Under the 2015 TRIA Reauthorization, the level of insured losses for certified events occurring during a calendar year required to trigger coverage under TRIA will increase annually by $20&nbsp;million per year until the level of insured losses required to trigger coverage reaches $200&nbsp;million in 2020. To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 83% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group&#146;s deductible. Under the 2015 TRIA Reauthorization, the federal government&#146;s reimbursement obligation will be reduced annually by 1%&nbsp;per year until the level of reimbursement is reduced to 80% in 2020. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2017 for Berkshire&#146;s consolidated insurance and reinsurance businesses is expected to approximate $1.1&nbsp;billion. There is also an aggregate limit of $100&nbsp;billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. Regulation of the insurance industry outside of the United States is subject to the laws and regulations of each country in which an insurer has operations or writes premiums. Some jurisdictions impose comprehensive regulatory requirements on insurance businesses, such as in the United Kingdom, where insurers are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and in Germany where insurers are subject to regulation by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Other jurisdictions may impose fewer requirements. In certain foreign countries, reinsurers are also required to be licensed by governmental authorities. These licenses may be subject to modification, suspension or revocation dependent on such factors as amount and types of insurance liabilities and minimum capital and solvency tests. The violation of regulatory requirements may result in fines, censures and/or criminal sanctions in various jurisdictions. Berkshire&#146;s insurance underwriting operations comprise the following sub-groups: (1)&nbsp;GEICO and its subsidiaries, (2)&nbsp;General Re and its subsidiaries, (3)&nbsp;Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and (4)&nbsp;Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and structured settlement and periodic payment annuity reinsurance products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over very long periods of time (creating &#147;float,&#148; see Investments section below), Berkshire expects to achieve a net underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include investment income earned from investments. Berkshire&#146;s insurance subsidiaries employ approximately 44,000 people. Additional information related to each of Berkshire&#146;s four underwriting groups follows. GEICO &#151;GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland and its insurance subsidiaries consist of: Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. These companies primarily offer private &nbsp; 2 Table of Contents passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, GEICO insures motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, boat, life and identity management insurance to individuals to provide insurance and financial services for buyers who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. GEICO markets its policies primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone. GEICO competes for private passenger auto insurance customers with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces. The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. Some insurance companies may exacerbate price competition by selling their products for a period of time at less than adequate rates. GEICO will not knowingly follow that strategy. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer as well as with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate (including Esurance), Progressive and USAA. As a result of an aggressive advertising campaign and competitive rates, voluntary policies-in-force have increased about 38% over the past five years. GEICO was the second largest private passenger auto insurer in the United States in terms of premium volume in 2016. According to most recently published A.M. Best data, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2015 of approximately 54%, with GEICO&#146;s market share being approximately 11.4%. Since the publication of that data, management believes that GEICO&#146;s current market share has grown to approximately 12%. Seasonal variations in GEICO&#146;s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. Private passenger auto insurance is stringently regulated by state insurance departments. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO&#146;s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO is a material asset and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations. General Re &#151;General Re Corporation (&#147;General Re&#148;) is the holding company of General Reinsurance Corporation (&#147;GRC&#148;) and its subsidiaries and affiliates. GRC&#146;s subsidiaries include General Reinsurance AG, (&#147;GRAG&#148;), a major international reinsurer based in Germany. General Re subsidiaries currently conduct business activities globally in 45 cities and provide insurance and reinsurance coverages throughout the world. General Re provides property/casualty insurance and reinsurance, life/health reinsurance and other reinsurance intermediary and risk management services, underwriting management and investment management services. General Re is one of the largest reinsurers in the world based on premium volume and shareholder capital. Property/Casualty Insurance and Reinsurance General Re&#146;s property/casualty reinsurance business in North America is conducted through GRC, which is domiciled in Delaware and licensed in the District of Columbia and all states but Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. Property/casualty operations in North America are headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and are also conducted through 13 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. Reinsurance activities are marketed directly to clients without involving a broker or intermediary. In 2016, approximately 41% of net written premiums in North America related to casualty reinsurance coverages and 41% related to property reinsurance coverages. General Re&#146;s property/casualty business in North America also includes specialty insurers domiciled in Delaware. General Star is a specialty and surplus lines provider, underwriting a broad array of property, casualty and professional liability business through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators. Genesis is an alternative risk insurance provider, offering solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. In 2016, these specialty insurers represented approximately 18% of General Re&#146;s North American property/casualty net written premiums. General Re&#146;s international property/casualty reinsurance business operations are conducted through internationally-based subsidiaries on a direct basis (without intermediaries) via General Reinsurance AG as well as several other General Re subsidiaries and branches in 18 countries. Coverages are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines, including property, aviation and casualty. In 2016, international-based property/casualty operations principally wrote reinsurance on a direct basis in the form of treaties, with lesser amounts written on a facultative basis. International property/casualty business is also written through brokers, primarily via Faraday, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd&#146;s and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. &nbsp; 3 Table of Contents Life/Health Reinsurance General Re&#146;s North American life/health business segments include life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care. The international life/health business is segmented by geographic region and transacts business worldwide. The principal business segments include life, disability, critical illness, health and long-term care. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. In 2016, approximately 34% of life/health net premiums were written in the United States, 22% in Western Europe and the remaining 44% throughout the rest of the world. Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group &#151;Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (&#147;BHRG&#148;) operations are based in Stamford, Connecticut. Business activities are conducted through numerous subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (&#147;NICO&#148;) and Columbia Insurance Company (&#147;Columbia&#148;). BHRG provides principally excess and quota-share reinsurance to other property and casualty insurers and reinsurers. BHRG also offers life reinsurance and annuity contracts through Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (&#147;BHLN&#148;). The type and volume of insurance and reinsurance business written by BHRG is dependent on current market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of BHRG&#146;s underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. BHRG underwrites traditional non-catastrophe property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and individual primary insurance policies on an excess-of-loss basis for primarily large or otherwise unusual discrete risks, referred to as &#147;individual risk.&#148; BHRG periodically participates in underwriting placements with major brokers in the London Market through a wholly-owned subsidiary based in Great Britain. BHRG&#146;s business is written through intermediary brokers or directly with the insured or reinsured. Effective July&nbsp;1, 2015, NICO entered into a 10-year, 20% quota-share reinsurance agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (&#147;IAG&#148;). IAG is a large insurance group that currently writes multiple lines of business in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia Pacific countries. BHRG periodically assumes risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts afford protection to ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from events that have already occurred and that are insured under policies issued in prior years. Coverage under such contracts is provided on an excess basis or for losses payable immediately after the inception of the contract. Coverage provided is normally subject to large aggregate limits of indemnification. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. In BHRG&#146;s retroactive reinsurance business, the concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices and contract terms, since the payment of losses under the insurance contracts are often expected to occur over long time periods. Losses payable under these policies are normally expected to exceed premiums and therefore, produce underwriting losses. This business is accepted, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds (&#147;float&#148;) generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. In 2014, NICO entered into a reinsurance contract with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (&#147;LMIC&#148;). Under the agreement, NICO reinsures substantially all of LMIC&#146;s unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expense liabilities related to (a)&nbsp;asbestos and environmental claims from policies incepting prior to 2005, and (b)&nbsp;workers&#146; compensation claims occurrences arising prior to January&nbsp;1, 2014, subject to an aggregate retention of approximately $12.5&nbsp;billion and subject to an aggregate limit of $6.5&nbsp;billion. In January 2017, NICO entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with various subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, &#147;AIG&#148;). Under the agreement, NICO agreed to indemnify AIG for 80% of up to $25&nbsp;billion, excess of $25&nbsp;billion retained by AIG, of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses with respect to certain commercial insurance loss events occurring in years prior to 2016 for a premium of about $10&nbsp;billion. BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, it receives upfront premiums and makes a stream of annuity payments in the future and payment streams often extend for decades. Similar to retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of money concepts are an important factor in establishing such premiums and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. BHLN also writes reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance. BHLN and its affiliates have also periodically reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income, and similar benefit coverages on closed-blocks of variable annuity reinsurance contracts. &nbsp; 4 Table of Contents Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group &#151;The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (&#147;BH Primary&#148;) is a collection of independently managed primary insurance operations that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below. NICO and certain affiliates (&#147;NICO Primary&#148;) underwrite motor vehicle and general liability insurance to commercial enterprises on both an admitted and excess and surplus basis. This business is written nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers and is based in Omaha, Nebraska. The &#147;Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies&#148; (&#147;BHHC&#148;) is a group of insurers offering standalone workers&#146; compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages. BHHC has developed a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers&#146; compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state operated workers&#146; compensation funds. The volume of workers&#146; compensation business written in recent years has grown significantly. BHHC serves a diverse client base. BHHC&#146;s business is generated primarily through independent agents and brokers. MedPro Group (&#147;MedPro&#148;) is a national leader in offering customized healthcare liability insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. MedPro has provided insurance coverage to protect healthcare providers against losses since 1899. Its insurance policies are distributed primarily through a nationwide network of appointed agents and brokers. MedPro recently began offering coverage options to healthcare providers in the United Kingdom, France and Singapore, as well as reinsurance options related to student health insurance programs. U.S. Investment Corporation (&#147;USIC&#148;) and its subsidiaries are specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines of insurance on an admitted and excess and surplus basis. Policies are marketed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USIC companies underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. Applied Underwriters, Inc. (&#147;Applied&#148;) is a leading provider of payroll and insurance services to small and mid-sized employers. Applied, through its subsidiaries principally markets a product that bundles workers&#146; compensation and other employment related insurance coverages and business services into a seamless package that is designed to reduce the risks and remove the burden of administrative and regulatory requirements faced by small to mid-sized employers. Applied also markets a workers&#146; compensation product with a profit sharing component targeted to medium-sized employers. WestGUARD Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies) provides commercial property and casualty insurance coverage to small and mid-sized businesses and is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Central States Indemnity Company of Omaha, based in Omaha, Nebraska, primarily writes Medicare Supplement insurance and credit insurance. Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (&#147;BH Specialty&#148;) was formed in April 2013. BH Specialty provides primary and excess commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional lines, surety and travel insurance and other insurance. BH Specialty writes business on both an excess and surplus lines basis and an admitted basis in the U.S., and on a locally admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several cities in the U. S. and international offices in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom and Macau. BH Specialty currently intends to further expand its operations. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents. Property and casualty loss liabilities Berkshire&#146;s property and casualty insurance companies establish liabilities for estimated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to claims occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Such estimates include provisions for reported claims or case estimates, provisions for incurred-but-not-reported claims and legal and administrative costs to settle claims. The estimates of unpaid losses and amounts recoverable under reinsurance are established and continually reviewed by using a variety of actuarial, statistical and analytical techniques. Reference is made to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 and &#147;Critical Accounting Policies,&#148; included in Item&nbsp;7 of this Report. Investments &#151;Invested assets of insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (&#147;float&#148;). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and &nbsp; 5 Table of Contents loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $70&nbsp;billion at the end of 2011 to approximately $91&nbsp;billion at the end of 2016, primarily through internal growth. BHRG and General Re accounted for approximately 69% of the consolidated float as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Over the past five years, Berkshire&#146;s cost of float was negative, as insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains. Investments of insurance subsidiaries include a very large portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire&#146;s corporate headquarters. Generally, there are no targeted investment allocation rates established by management with respect to investment activities. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity investments than is customary in the insurance industry. Railroad Business&#151;Burlington Northern Santa Fe Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (&#147;BNSF&#148;) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF had approximately 42,000 employees at the end of 2016. In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Over half of freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations, while the balance is subject to common carrier published prices or quotations offered by BNSF. BNSF&#146;s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. BNSF&#146;s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016, approximately 35% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 25% from industrial products, 22% from agricultural products and 18% from coal. Regulatory Matters BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all of its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (&#147;STB&#148;) of the United States Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;), the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#147;OSHA&#148;), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF&#146;s business. The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. BNSF Railway is required to transport these commodities to the extent of its common carrier obligation. Environmental Matters BNSF&#146;s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. This regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. Many of BNSF&#146;s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF is now subject to, and will from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#147;CERCLA&#148;), also known as &nbsp; 6 Table of Contents the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liabilities for the cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, BNSF may be responsible under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by BNSF, its current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. Competition The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines in certain markets, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF&#146;s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class&nbsp;I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF. Based on weekly reporting by the Association of American Railroads, BNSF&#146;s share of the western United States rail traffic in 2016 was approximately 50.1%. Utilities and Energy Businesses&#151;Berkshire Hathaway Energy Berkshire currently owns approximately 90% of the outstanding common stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (or &#147;BHE&#148;).

As vertically integrated utilities, BHE&#146;s domestic utilities own approximately 27,600 net megawatts of generation capacity in operation and under construction. There are seasonal variations in these businesses that are principally related to the use of &nbsp; 7 Table of Contents electricity for air conditioning and natural gas for heating. Typically, regulated electric revenues are higher in the summer months, while regulated natural gas revenues are higher in the winter months. The Great Britain utilities consist of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, which own a substantial electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England in an area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. The distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated tariffs for the use of their distribution systems. BHE acquired AltaLink L.P. (&#147;AltaLink&#148;) on December&nbsp;1, 2014. AltaLink is a regulated electric transmission-only utility company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. AltaLink connects generation plants to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory. AltaLink receives all of its regulated transmission tariffs from the Alberta Electric System Operator (&#147;AESO&#148;) based on tariffs approved by the Alberta Utilities Commission (&#147;AUC&#148;). The natural gas pipelines consist of Northern Natural Gas Company (&#147;Northern Natural&#148;) and Kern River Gas Transmission Company (&#147;Kern River&#148;). Northern Natural, based in Nebraska, owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States, as measured by pipeline miles, reaching from west Texas to Michigan&#146;s Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural&#146;s pipeline system consists of approximately 14,700 miles of natural gas pipelines. Northern Natural&#146;s extensive pipeline system, which is interconnected with many interstate and intrastate pipelines in the national grid system, has access to supplies from multiple major supply basins and provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. Northern Natural also operates three underground natural gas storage facilities and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units. Northern Natural&#146;s pipeline system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand typically occurring during the months of November through March. Kern River, based in Utah, owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that consists of approximately 1,700 miles and extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. BHE Renewables is based in Iowa and owns interests in independent power projects having approximately 4,000 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service or under construction in California, Illinois, Nebraska, Texas, New York, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Hawaii and the Philippines. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from solar, wind, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Regulatory Matters PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#147;FERC&#148;) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.2&nbsp;million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. With certain limited exceptions, BHE&#146;s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility&#146;s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services. Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April&nbsp;1, 2015 through March&nbsp;31, 2023. &nbsp; 8 Table of Contents AltaLink is regulated by the AUC, pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink&#146;s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the AESO for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is the independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta&#146;s integrated electrical system (&#147;AIES&#148;) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a)&nbsp;rates, charges, terms and conditions of service and (b)&nbsp;the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administrated by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency within the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. Environmental Matters BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation&#146;s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE&#146;s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force November&nbsp;4, 2016. Supporting the United States&#146; commitment under the Paris Agreement is the Clean Power Plan, finalized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) in August 2015. The Clean Power Plan established the Best System of Emission Reduction for fossil-fueled power plants to include: (a)&nbsp;heat rate improvements; (b)&nbsp;increased utilization of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities; and (c)&nbsp;increased deployment of new and incremental non-carbon generation placed in service after 2012. Applying the Best System of Emission Reduction, the EPA established uniform subcategory specific emission performance rates of 771 pounds per megawatt hour for natural gas combined cycle units and 1,305 pounds per megawatt hour for coal-fueled generating units and utilized these emission rates to establish the applicable state-by-state emission rates. The final Clean Power Plan compliance obligations begin in 2022, and extend through 2030. When fully &nbsp; 9 Table of Contents implemented the rule would achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. The final Clean Power Plan provides states the option to implement rate-based plans that limit the pounds per megawatt hour their effected generating units can emit or mass-based plans that limit the total tons of emissions from affected sources as well as to allow their affected units to engage in emission trading in either a mass- or rate-based plan. States were required under the final rule to submit initial plans to the EPA by September&nbsp;6, 2016. However, on February&nbsp;9, 2016, the United States Supreme Court ordered that the EPA&#146;s emission guidelines for existing sources be stayed pending the disposition of the challenges to the rule in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and any action on a writ of certiorari before the United States Supreme Court. The case has been fully briefed and oral argument was held before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on September&nbsp;27, 2016; the court has not yet issued its decision. The full impacts of the final rule or the federal plan on BHE and its energy subsidiaries cannot be determined until the outcome of the pending litigation and subsequent appeals, the outcome of any issues should the case be remanded for further action by the EPA, the development and implementation of state plans, and finalization of the federal plan. BHE continues to take actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, BHE has invested $19&nbsp;billion in solar, wind, geothermal and biomass generation. Non-Energy Businesses BHE also owns HomeServices of America, Inc. (&#147;HomeServices&#148;), the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. In addition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices offers other integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking, title and closing services, property and casualty insurance, home warranties, relocation services and other home-related services. It operates under 38&nbsp;brand names with over 29,000&nbsp;agents in nearly 540&nbsp;brokerage offices in 28&nbsp;states. In October 2012, HomeServices acquired a 66.7% interest in one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States, which offers and sells independently owned and operated residential real estate brokerage franchises. HomeServices&#146; franchise network currently includes over 375 franchisees in over 1,500 brokerage offices in 47 states with over 46,000 agents under three brand names. In exchange for certain fees, HomeServices provides the right to use the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, Prudential or Real Living brand names and other related service marks, as well as providing orientation programs, training and consultation services, advertising programs and other services. HomeServices&#146; principal sources of revenue are dependent on residential real estate sales, which are generally higher in the second and third quarters of each year. This business is highly competitive and subject to the general real estate market conditions.

These products are produced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliances and recreation markets. The majority of sales to customers are individual purchase orders generated from long-term agreements. Most orders are subject to termination by the customer upon payment of the cost of work in process, plus a related profit factor. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors using either the same types of manufacturing processes or other forms of manufacturing. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. A number of raw materials in its products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their work forces, and/or unstable governments in exporting nations and inflation. Marmon Holdings Berkshire currently owns 99.75% of Marmon Holdings, Inc.

BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Over 85% of BHA&#146;s revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers and driving revenue. BHA&#146;s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and the ownership structure of franchised automotive dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA&#146;s ability to make further acquisitions of such manufacturers&#146; stores. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be acquired by BHA. Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer&#146;s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to the manufacturer&#146;s trademarks. The agreements contain various operational requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. The states generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is very difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with &#147;good cause&#148; under the applicable state franchise law. BHA owns approximately 6.0&nbsp;million square feet of buildings and approximately 945 acres of land that are utilized in the BHA dealership and related operations. BHA also develops, underwrites and administers the various vehicle protection plans, life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through the dealerships on products sold by BHA&#146;s dealerships as well as third party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials, and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership&#146;s finance and insurance personnel. Home furnishings retailing The home furnishings businesses are Nebraska Furniture Mart (&#147;NFM&#148;), R.C. Willey Home Furnishings (&#147;R.C.

In addition, NFM and R.C. Willey sell a full line of major household appliances, electronics, computers and other home furnishings. These businesses also offer customer financing to complement their retail operations. An important feature of each of these businesses is their ability to control costs and to produce high business volume by offering significant value to their customers. NFM operates its business from three very large retail complexes with almost 2.8&nbsp;million square feet of retail space and sizable warehouse and administrative facilities in Omaha, Nebraska, Kansas City, Kansas and The Colony, Texas. NFM is the largest furniture retailer in each of these markets. The Colony, Texas store opened in 2015 and includes retail space of approximately 560,000 square feet. NFM also owns Homemakers Furniture located in Des Moines, Iowa, which has approximately 215,000 square feet of retail space. R.C. Willey, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the dominant home furnishings retailer in the Intermountain West region of the United States. R.C. Willey currently operates 11 retail stores and three distribution centers. These facilities include approximately 1.3&nbsp;million square feet of retail space with six stores located in Utah, one store in Idaho, three stores in Nevada and one store in California. Star&#146;s retail facilities include about 700,000 square feet of retail space in 11 locations in Texas with eight in Houston. Star maintains a dominant position in each of its markets. Jordan&#146;s operates a furniture retail business from six locations with approximately 755,000 square feet of retail space in stores located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and a &nbsp; 20 Table of Contents newly-opened store in New Haven, Connecticut. The retail stores are supported by an 800,000 square foot distribution center in Taunton, Massachusetts. Jordan&#146;s is the largest furniture retailer, as measured by sales, in the Massachusetts and New Hampshire areas.

Louis has over 70 stores in Germany and Austria and also sells through catalogs and via the Internet throughout most of Europe. In 2016, Louis opened its first store in Switzerland. Berkshire&#146;s retailing businesses employ approximately 30,000 people. Finance and Financial Products Berkshire&#146;s finance and financial products activities include an integrated manufactured housing and finance business, leasing of transportation equipment, and furniture leasing. Berkshire&#146;s finance and financial products businesses employ approximately 24,000 people in the aggregate. Information concerning these activities follows. Clayton Homes Clayton Homes, Inc. (&#147;Clayton&#148;), headquartered near Knoxville, Tennessee, is a vertically integrated home building company. Clayton operates 38 manufacturing plants in 12 states. Clayton&#146;s homes are marketed in 48 states through a network of 1,923 retailers, including 341 company-owned home centers and 100 subdivisions. Financing is offered through its finance subsidiaries to purchasers of Clayton&#146;s manufactured homes as well as those purchasing homes from selected independent retailers. &nbsp; 21 Table of Contents Clayton competes at the manufacturing, retail and finance levels based on price, service, delivery capabilities and product performance and considers the ability to make financing available to retail purchasers a major factor affecting the market acceptance of its product. Retail sales are supported by Clayton&#146;s offering of various financing and insurance programs. Financing programs support company-owned home centers and select independent retailers. Proprietary loan underwriting guidelines have been developed and include ability to repay calculations, including debt to income limits, consideration of residual income and credit score requirements, which are considered in evaluating loan applicants. Approximately 72% of the originations are home-only loans and the remaining 28% have land as additional collateral. The average down payment is approximately 15%, which may be from cash, trade or land equity. Certain loan types require an independent third-party valuation; additionally, if land is involved in the transaction it generally is independently appraised in order to establish the value of the land only or the home and the land as a package. Originations are all at fixed rates and for fixed terms. Loans outstanding include non-government originations, bulk purchases of contracts and notes from banks and other lenders. Clayton also provides inventory financing to certain independent retailers and community operators and services housing contracts and notes that were not purchased or originated. The bulk contract purchases and servicing arrangements may relate to the portfolios of other lenders or finance companies, governmental agencies, or other entities that purchase and hold housing contracts and notes. Clayton also acts as agent on physical damage insurance policies, homebuyer protection plan policies and other programs. Transportation Equipment Leasing UTLX Company (&#147;UTLX&#148;), headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, operates railcar, crane, intermodal tank container, manufacturing and service businesses under several brand names. Union Tank Car is a leading designer, builder and full-service lessor of tank cars and other specialized railcars. Union Tank Car and its Canadian affiliate Procor own a fleet of over 134,000 railcars which they lease to chemical, petrochemical, energy and agricultural/food customers across North America, supported by railcar repair facilities and mobile units. Union Tank Car also manufactures tank cars in two U.S. plants. Sterling Crane in Canada and the U.S. and Freo Group in Australia are major mobile crane service providers with a total fleet of approximately 1,000 cranes primarily serving energy, mining and petrochemical markets. EXSIF Worldwide is a leading international lessor of intermodal tank containers with a fleet of approximately 47,000 units primarily serving chemical producers and logistics operators. UTLX has a large number of customers diversified both geographically and across industries. UTLX, while subject to cyclicality and significant competition in all of its markets, successfully competes by offering a broad range of high quality products and services targeted at its niche markets from geographically strategic locations. Railcars and intermodal tank containers are usually leased for multiple-year terms and most of the leases are renewed upon expiration. As a result of selective ongoing capital investment and high maintenance standards, utilization rates (the number of units on lease to total units available) of UTLX&#146;s railcar, crane and intermodal tank container equipment are generally relatively high. While tank cars operate in a highly regulated environment in North America, regulatory changes are not expected to materially impact UTLX&#146;s operational capability, competitive position, or financial strength. XTRA Corporation (&#147;XTRA&#148;), headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a leading transportation equipment lessor operating under the XTRA Lease &reg; brand name. XTRA manages a diverse fleet of approximately 78,000 units located at 51 facilities throughout the United States. The fleet includes over-the-road and storage trailers, chassis, temperature controlled vans and flatbed trailers. XTRA is one of the largest lessors (in terms of units available) of over-the-road trailers in North America. Transportation equipment customers lease equipment to cover cyclical, seasonal and geographic needs and as a substitute for purchasing equipment. Therefore, as a provider of marginal capacity of transportation equipment, XTRA&#146;s utilization rates and operating results tend to be cyclical. In addition, transportation providers often use leasing to maximize their asset utilization and reduce capital expenditures. By maintaining a large fleet, XTRA is able to provide customers with a broad selection of equipment and quick response times. Other financial activities CORT Business Services Corporation is the leading national provider of rental relocation services including rental furniture, accessories and related services in the &#147;rent-to-rent&#148; market of the furniture rental industry. BH Finance LLC invests in fixed-income and equity instruments. Historically, BH Finance LLC also entered into derivative contracts involving foreign currency, equity price and credit default risk. However, such derivative contracts are currently comprised of equity index contracts that were written prior to 2009. BH Finance&#146;s activities are managed from Berkshire&#146;s corporate headquarters. Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur due to the nature of these activities as well as the markets in general. Additional information with respect to Berkshire&#146;s businesses The amounts of revenue, earnings before taxes and identifiable assets attributable to the aforementioned business segments are included in Note 23 to Berkshire&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item&nbsp;8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Risk Factors Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, age 86, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 93. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr.&nbsp;Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire&#146;s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire subsidiary managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr.&nbsp;Buffett. Berkshire&#146;s Board has agreed on a replacement for Mr.&nbsp;Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr.&nbsp;Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board&#146;s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Changes in demographics, training requirements and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact one or more of our significant operating subsidiaries ability to meet demands of customers to supply goods and services. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our operations. Although we have adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The past growth rate in Berkshire&#146;s book value per share is not an indication of future results. In the years since present management acquired control of Berkshire, our book value per share has grown at a highly satisfactory rate. Because of the large size of our capital base (Berkshire shareholders&#146; equity was approximately $283&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016), our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at a rate close to its past rate. Investments are unusually concentrated and fair values are subject to loss in value. We concentrate a high percentage of the investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities and diversify our investment portfolios far less than is conventional in the insurance industry. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders&#146; equity and our consolidated book value per share. Under certain circumstances, as required under existing GAAP, significant declines in the &nbsp; 23 Table of Contents fair values of these investments may require the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses. In addition, beginning in 2018 due to a pending change in GAAP, all changes in the fair values of these investments (whether realized or unrealized) will be recognized as gains or losses in our consolidated statement of earnings. Accordingly, periodic changes in reported earnings will likely be subject to significant variability. Since a large percentage of our investments are held in our insurance subsidiaries, a decrease in the fair values of our investments could produce a large decline in statutory surplus. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a material decline could have a materially adverse affect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus affecting our future underwriting profitability. Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. Each of our operating businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the industries in which they operate. To the extent that the economy deteriorates for a prolonged period of time, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses, our railroad business and our manufactured housing business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures. These businesses depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. Terrorist acts against the United States could hurt our operating businesses. A successful (as defined by the aggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack against the United States could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. This is a risk that we share with all U.S. based businesses. Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. In recent years, partially in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives have accelerated in the United States and abroad. Such initiatives address for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, environmental and global-warming matters and health care reform. These initiatives impact not only our regulated insurance, energy and railroad transportation businesses, but also our manufacturing, services, retailing and financing businesses. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant but not controlling economic interest. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cyber security risks We rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders, and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and exposes us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are &nbsp; 24 Table of Contents unable to acquire or implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Cyber attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, or our customers or suppliers may result in business interruptions, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security and repair or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, sustained or significant cyber attacks, or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. Derivative contracts may require significant future cash settlement payments and result in significant losses. We have assumed the risk of potentially significant losses under equity index put option contracts. Although we received considerable premiums as compensation for accepting these risks, there is no assurance that the premiums we received will exceed our aggregate settlement payments. Risks of losses under our equity index put option contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major stock indexes. When these contracts expire beginning in 2018, we could be required to make significant payments if equity index prices are significantly below the strike prices specified in the contracts. Equity index put option contracts are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the periodic changes in fair values are reported in earnings. The valuations of these contracts and the impact on our periodic earnings can be particularly significant reflecting the inherent volatility of equity markets. Adverse changes in equity may result in material losses in periodic earnings. Risks unique to our regulated businesses Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single event. We may also write coverages for losses arising from acts of terrorism. We attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses might aggregate above $10&nbsp;billion. Currently, we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10&nbsp;billion. However, despite our efforts, losses may aggregate in unanticipated ways. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings (or net losses) in a future period. The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses. The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Except for certain product lines, our objective is to generate underwriting profits over the long-term. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($77&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016) so even small percentage increases to the aggregate liability estimate can result in materially lower future periodic reported earnings. Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance companies may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. &nbsp; 25 Table of Contents Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of governmental laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF&#146;s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Federal legislation enacted in 2008 and amended in 2015 mandates the implementation of positive train control technology by December&nbsp;31, 2018, on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where toxic-by-inhalation (&#147;TIH&#148;) hazardous materials are transported. Further, federal regulations promulgated in 2015 mandate the implementation of electronically controlled pneumatic braking systems on certain crude oil trains by 2021 and all high-hazard flammable trains, as defined by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and Federal Railroad Administration, by 2023. These types of technology require further testing and deploying them across BNSF&#146;s railroad system and other railroads may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities. Low natural gas prices or oil prices could impact future energy-related commodities demand. To the extent that changes in government environmental policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport TIH chemicals and other hazardous materials. An accidental release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Increased economic regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF&#146;s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses, have broad application and limit their management&#146;s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters, including acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; transacting between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, cyber security, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers&#146; needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for very long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The risk of operational or financial failure of capital projects is not necessarily recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements are funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of these businesses. &nbsp; Item&nbsp;&nbsp;1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. &nbsp; Item&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Description of Properties The properties used by Berkshire&#146;s business segments are summarized in this section. Berkshire&#146;s railroad and utilities and energy businesses, in particular, utilize considerable physical assets in their businesses. &nbsp; 26 Table of Contents Railroad Business&#151;Burlington Northern Santa Fe Through BNSF Railway, BNSF operates one of the largest railroad networks in North America. BNSF Railway operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track (excluding multiple main tracks, yard tracks and sidings) in 28 states, and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF owns over 23,000 route miles, including easements, and operates over 9,000 route miles of trackage rights that permit BNSF to operate its trains with its crews over other railroads&#146; tracks. The total BNSF Railway system, including single and multiple main tracks, yard tracks and sidings, consists of over 50,000 operated miles of track, all of which are owned by or held under easement by BNSF except for over 10,000 miles operated under trackage rights. BNSF operates various facilities and equipment to support its transportation system, including its infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars. It also owns or leases other equipment to support rail operations such as vehicles. Support facilities for rail operations include yards and terminals throughout its rail network, system locomotive shops to perform locomotive servicing and maintenance, a centralized network operations center for train dispatching and network operations monitoring and management in Fort Worth, Texas, regional dispatching centers, computers, telecommunications equipment, signal systems and other support systems. Transfer facilities are maintained for rail-to-rail as well as intermodal transfer of containers, trailers and other freight traffic and include approximately 25 intermodal hubs located across the system. BNSF owns or holds under non-cancelable leases exceeding one year approximately 8,000 locomotives and 72,000 freight cars, in addition to maintenance of way and other equipment. In the ordinary course of business, BNSF makes significant capital investments to expand and improve its railroad network. BNSF incurs significant costs in repairing and maintaining its properties. In 2016, BNSF recorded approximately $2&nbsp;billion in repairs and maintenance expense. Utilities and Energy Businesses&#151;Berkshire Hathaway Energy BHE&#146;s energy properties consist of the physical assets necessary to support its electricity and natural gas businesses. Properties of BHE&#146;s electricity businesses include electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as coal mining assets that support certain of BHE&#146;s electric generating facilities. Properties of BHE&#146;s natural gas businesses include natural gas distribution facilities, interstate pipelines, storage facilities, compressor stations and meter stations. The transmission and distribution assets are primarily within each of BHE&#146;s utility service territories.

Legal Proceedings Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. &nbsp; Item&nbsp;4.

Record owners included nominees holding at least 430,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock and 1,300,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock on behalf of beneficial-but-not-of-record owners. Dividends Berkshire has not declared a cash dividend since 1967. Common Stock Repurchase Program Berkshire&#146;s Board of Directors (&#147;Berkshire&#146;s Board&#148;) has approved a common stock repurchase program under which Berkshire may repurchase its Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Berkshire&#146;s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire&#146;s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20&nbsp;billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class&nbsp;A or Class&nbsp;B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share repurchases under the program in 2016. &nbsp; 30 Table of Contents Item&nbsp;6.

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire&#146;s corporate governance practices, including, but not limited to, communicating the appropriate &#147;tone at the top&#148; messages to employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. The business segment data (Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $1.4&nbsp;billion in 2016, an increase of $208&nbsp;million from 2015, primarily due to increased earnings from Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group and General Re, partly offset by lower net underwriting gains from primary insurance. Our railroad business generated lower net earnings in 2016, primarily due to a 5.0% decline in unit volume. Earnings of our utilities and energy businesses increased in 2016, attributable to increased pre-tax earnings and a lower effective income tax rate. The increase in after-tax earnings in 2016 as compared to 2015 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses was primarily due to earnings from PCC, partly offset by comparatively lower overall earnings from the other businesses within this group. Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $1.2&nbsp;billion in 2015, a decline of $530&nbsp;million from 2014, which reflected rising claim costs at GEICO and lower earnings from our reinsurers, partially offset by increased earnings from our other primary insurance operations. Our railroad business generated a 9.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting improved service levels and lower fuel costs. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy businesses in 2015 increased 13.3% over 2014, attributable to the acquisition of AltaLink in December 2014 and higher earnings from several of our other energy businesses. After-tax earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2015 increased 4.8% over 2014. The positive impacts of business acquisitions and higher earnings from our building products businesses were partly offset by lower earnings from certain of our industrial products and service businesses. After-tax investment and derivative gains were approximately $6.5&nbsp;billion in 2016, $6.7&nbsp;billion in 2015 and $3.3&nbsp;billion in 2014. After-tax investment gains in 2016 included approximately $2.7 billion from the disposition or conversion of our Wrigley, Kraft Heinz and Dow preferred stock investments and non-cash gains of approximately $1.9&nbsp;billion related to the exchange of P&amp;G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. After-tax investment and derivative gains in 2015 included non-cash holding gains of approximately $4.4&nbsp;billion in connection with our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock. In 2014, after-tax gains included approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion related to the exchanges of Phillips 66 common stock and Graham Holdings Company common stock for a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Derivative contracts contributed after-tax gains of $488&nbsp;million in 2016, $633&nbsp;million in 2015 and $329&nbsp;million in 2014. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported results or evaluating our economic performance. Investment and derivative gains and losses have caused and will likely continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. &nbsp; 32 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; Insurance&#151;Underwriting We engage in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property/casualty, life and health risks. In primary insurance activities, we assume defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. In reinsurance activities, we assume defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (&#147;BHRG&#148;) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Our management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations &#150; underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers; investing decisions, with limited exceptions, are the responsibility of Berkshire&#146;s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains/losses. The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to BHRG and General Re. Our periodic underwriting results may be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years. Actual claim settlements and revised loss estimates will develop over time, which will likely differ from the liabilities recorded as of year-end 2016 of approximately $76.9&nbsp;billion. Accordingly, the unpaid loss estimates recorded as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 will develop upward or downward in future periods, producing a corresponding decrease or increase to pre-tax earnings. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S.&nbsp;Dollar denominated reinsurance liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rates can be volatile and the resulting impact on our underwriting earnings can be relatively significant. Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Underwriting gain attributable to: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GEICO &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 462 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 460 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,159 &nbsp; General Re &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 190 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 132 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 277 &nbsp; Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 822 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 421 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 606 &nbsp; Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 657 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 824 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 626 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pre-tax underwriting gain &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,131 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,837 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,668 &nbsp; Income taxes and noncontrolling interests &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 761 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 675 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 976 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net underwriting gain &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,370 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,162 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,692 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GEICO GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

These increases reflected voluntary auto policy-in-force growth of 7% and increased average premiums per auto policy resulting from rate increases, changes in coverage and state and risk mix. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2016 increased 10.9% compared to the prior year. The growth in voluntary auto new business accelerated over the last half of 2016 and, for the year, voluntary auto policies-in-force increased 974,000. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2016 increased $2.4&nbsp;billion (12.9%) to $21.0&nbsp;billion. In 2016, our loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to earned premiums) increased 0.5 percentage points, reflecting increased storm losses and claims severity, partly offset by the aforementioned premium rate increases. Claims frequencies (claim counts per exposure unit) in 2016 for property damage, collision, bodily injury and personal injury protection (PIP) coverages were relatively unchanged from 2015. Average claims severities were higher in 2016 for bodily injury, physical damage and collision coverages (four to six percent range). In addition, storm-related losses (primarily from hail and flooding) in 2016 were approximately $423&nbsp;million compared to $162&nbsp;million in 2015. Underwriting expenses in 2016 were $4.0&nbsp;billion, an increase of $366&nbsp;million (10.1%) over 2015. Our expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) in 2016 decreased 0.3 percentage points&nbsp;compared to 2015. The largest components of underwriting expenses are employee-related expenses (salaries and benefits) and advertising costs. The increase in underwriting expenses reflected the increase in policies-in-force. Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased 11.5% and 10.8% over 2014. The increases in premiums reflected growth in voluntary auto policies-in-force (5.4%)&nbsp;and rate increases. Voluntary auto new business sales in 2015 exceeded 2014 by about 1%. In 2015, our voluntary auto policies-in-force grew by 707,000 policies. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2015 increased $2.7&nbsp;billion (17.1%)&nbsp;over 2014. Our loss ratio was 82.1% in 2015 compared to 77.7% in 2014. Claims frequencies in 2015 increased in all major coverages over 2014, including property damage and collision coverages (three to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (four to six percent range) and PIP (one to two percent range). Average claims severities were also higher in 2015 for property damage and collision coverages (four to five percent range), bodily injury coverage (six to seven percent range) and PIP coverage (two to four percent range). We attributed these increases to miles driven, repair costs (parts and labor) and medical costs, as well as to weather conditions. Underwriting expenses in 2015 increased 5.8% to $3.6&nbsp;billion. During 2015, advertising and employee-related costs grew at a slower rate than premiums. As a result, our expense ratio in 2015 declined 0.7 percentage points compared to 2014. General Re General Re conducts a reinsurance business offering property and casualty coverages to clients worldwide through General Reinsurance Corporation, Germany-based General Reinsurance AG, Faraday Holdings in London and other wholly-owned affiliates.

Insurance industry capacity remains high and price competition in most property/casualty reinsurance markets persists. We continue to decline business when we believe prices are inadequate. However, we remain prepared to write substantially more business when appropriate prices can be attained. Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $117&nbsp;million in 2016 and $150&nbsp;million in 2015. Results included pre-tax underwriting gains from property business of $211&nbsp;million in 2016, a decline of $78 million compared to 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years&#146; property business. There were no significant catastrophe or large property losses in each of the past three years. Our casualty/workers&#146; compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $94&nbsp;million in 2016 and $139&nbsp;million in 2015. Underwriting results in each year included net losses on current year business and charges for recurring discount accretion on workers&#146; compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts, partially offset by gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years&#146; business. Discount accretion and deferred charge amortization produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $89&nbsp;million in 2016 and $94&nbsp;million in 2015. Casualty losses tend to be long-tailed and the favorable loss experience is not a guarantee that the current ultimate liability estimates will develop favorably in the future. In 2015, property/casualty premiums written declined $532&nbsp;million (16%), while premiums earned decreased $298&nbsp;million (10%) compared to 2014. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums written and earned in 2015 declined 9% and 2% compared to 2014. Our premium volume declined in both the direct and broker markets worldwide. Our property/casualty business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $150&nbsp;million in 2015 and $204&nbsp;million in 2014. In 2015, our property business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $289&nbsp;million compared to $445&nbsp;million in 2014. The comparative decrease in underwriting gains reflected an increase in the current accident year loss ratio, primarily attributable to a relative increase in reported losses. Our casualty/workers&#146; compensation business produced pre-tax underwriting losses of $139&nbsp;million in 2015 and $241&nbsp;million in 2014. Underwriting results in each year included net losses on current year business, partly offset by gains from reductions of estimated losses on prior years&#146; business. The reductions of prior years&#146; losses were net of recurring charges for discount accretion on workers&#146; compensation liabilities and deferred charge amortization on retroactive reinsurance contracts of $94&nbsp;million in 2015 and $97&nbsp;million in 2014. Life/health Life/health premiums earned in 2016 decreased 3% compared to 2015. Adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015, as growth in the United Kingdom and Asia markets was offset by a decline in Canada. Our life/health business produced pre-tax underwriting gains of $73&nbsp;million in 2016 compared to losses of $18&nbsp;million in 2015. In 2016, underwriting results reflected increased underwriting gains from our international life business, lower claim severity in North America, and lower losses from changes in actuarial assumptions related to long-term care business. Life/health premiums written and earned in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014. However, adjusting for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, premiums earned in 2015 increased $266&nbsp;million (8%)&nbsp;as compared to 2014. In 2015, life business increased across a number of non-U.S. markets, particularly in Canada and Asia. Our life/health business produced aggregate pre-tax underwriting losses in 2015 of $18&nbsp;million compared to gains of $73&nbsp;million in 2014. Our North American long-term care business generated increased underwriting losses of $77&nbsp;million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to increased reserves from estimated premium deficiencies. We also experienced higher frequency and severity of losses in North American individual life business in 2015, partially offset by increased underwriting gains from international life business. &nbsp; 35 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Insurance&#151;Underwriting &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group BHRG underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverages on property and casualty risks for insurers and reinsurers worldwide, including property catastrophe insurance and reinsurance.

(&#147;IAG&#148;), which became effective on July&nbsp;1, 2015, partly offset by declines from property catastrophe and other quota-share business. The IAG quota-share contract represented 37% of our property/casualty earned premiums in 2016. Our premium volume is generally constrained for most property/casualty reinsurance coverages as rates, in our view, are generally inadequate. Consistent with General Re, we have the capacity and desire to write more business when appropriate pricing can be attained. Our property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains of $767&nbsp;million in 2016 and $944&nbsp;million in 2015. The decline in pre-tax underwriting gains in 2016 was primarily due to a comparative decline in gains from reductions of estimated prior years&#146; loss reserves. We experienced no significant catastrophe loss events during the last three years. Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased $605&nbsp;million (15%)&nbsp;and $352&nbsp;million (9%), respectively, compared to 2014. These increases were primarily attributable to the IAG quota-share contract, partially offset by lower property catastrophe, property quota-share and London facilities volume. The property/casualty business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2015 of $944&nbsp;million compared to $1.4&nbsp;billion in 2014. Underwriting results in 2015 included comparatively lower gains from property catastrophe reinsurance and comparatively lower gains from reductions of estimated prior years&#146; loss reserves. Retroactive reinsurance We periodically write retroactive reinsurance contracts, which provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to past loss events. Retroactive reinsurance premiums earned in 2016 primarily derived from three new contracts, including $670&nbsp;million from a contract with Hartford Fire Insurance Company covering the adverse development of certain asbestos and pollution claims losses, subject to an aggregate limit of $1.5&nbsp;billion. Premiums earned in 2014 included $3&nbsp;billion from a contract with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (&#147;LMIC&#148;), which covers claim liabilities from specified asbestos and environmental exposures under policies incepting before 2005, and workers&#146; compensation occurrences arising before 2014. Pre-tax underwriting results from certain retroactive reinsurance contracts include gains/losses associated with the re-measurement of foreign currency denominated liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. Such gains were $392&nbsp;million in 2016, $150&nbsp;million in 2015 and $273&nbsp;million in 2014 and primarily related to strengthening of the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar versus the Great Britain Pound (&#147;GBP&#148;) and the Euro. Before such gains, retroactive reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $441&nbsp;million in 2016, $619&nbsp;million in 2015 and $905&nbsp;million in 2014, attributable to deferred charge amortization and changes in the timing and amount of ultimate losses. The underwriting results of retroactive reinsurance include the periodic amortization of deferred charge assets established in connection with these contracts. At the inception of a contract, we recognize deferred charge assets for the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate losses payable over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charges over the estimated claims payment period based on estimates of the timing and amount of future loss payments. Amortization charges and deferred charge adjustments resulting from changes to the estimated timing and amount of future loss payments are included in earnings. &nbsp; 36 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Insurance&#151;Underwriting &nbsp;(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group&nbsp;(Continued) Retroactive reinsurance&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Changes in estimated ultimate liabilities for contracts written in prior years were relatively insignificant in 2016, whereas during each of the prior two years, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities approximately $550&nbsp;million in 2015 and $825&nbsp;million in 2014 for contracts written in prior years. We also reevaluated the timing of future payments of remaining liabilities, which produced changes to unamortized deferred charges. These increases in estimated ultimate liabilities, net of related deferred charge adjustments, produced incremental pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $90&nbsp;million in 2015 and $450&nbsp;million in 2014. As discussed in Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a retroactive reinsurance agreement with affiliates of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, &#147;AIG&#148;) in January 2017. Our premiums with respect to this contract are about $10 billion and our net aggregate limit is $20&nbsp;billion. Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were approximately $24.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $23.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015. Unamortized deferred charges related to such reinsurance contracts were approximately $8.0&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $7.6&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015. We currently estimate pre-tax losses in 2017 from deferred charge amortization of approximately $950&nbsp;million, including approximately $375 million related to the new AIG agreement. Life and annuity A summary BHRG&#146;s life and annuity underwriting results follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Premiums earned &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-tax&nbsp;underwriting&nbsp;gain&nbsp;(loss) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Periodic payment annuity &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,082 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,286 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,105 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (128 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ (202 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ (197 )&nbsp; Life reinsurance &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,502 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,481 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,555 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (45 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (23 )&nbsp; Variable annuity &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 17 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 19 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 21 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 231 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 193 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 47 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,601 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,786 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,681 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 104 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ (54 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ (173 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Premiums earned in 2016 from periodic payment annuity contracts decreased $204&nbsp;million (15.9%) compared to 2015. The decrease reflected the effect of a large reinsurance contract in 2015 that generated premiums of $425&nbsp;million, which more than offset a comparative increase in direct business. There were no periodic payment annuity reinsurance contracts in 2016. Generally, we receive premiums under periodic payment annuity contracts in full at inception and we make annuity payments over time, often extending for decades. At inception, we discount annuity liabilities for time value and recognize no gains or losses in earnings. Pre-tax underwriting losses are recognized over the annuity payment period from the recurring accretion of discounted annuity liabilities. Periodic payment annuity contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $128&nbsp;million in 2016, $202&nbsp;million in 2015 and $197&nbsp;million in 2014. Liabilities under certain contracts of a U.S. subsidiary are denominated in foreign currencies, most significantly the GBP. Changes in the exchange rates produce changes in the values of related liabilities, which are reflected in underwriting results. Exchange rate changes resulted in pre-tax gains of $313&nbsp;million in 2016, $103&nbsp;million in 2015 and $102&nbsp;million in 2014. Before foreign currency exchange rate changes, pre-tax underwriting losses from annuity contracts were $441&nbsp;million in 2016, $305&nbsp;million in 2015 and $299&nbsp;million in 2014. The increase in underwriting losses in 2016 reflected increased liabilities from new business and the impact of lower interest rates, which increased expected future loss payments under reinsurance contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were approximately $9.8&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $8.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate of these contracts was approximately 4.1% as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. &nbsp; 37 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Insurance&#151;Underwriting &nbsp;(Continued) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group&nbsp;(Continued) Life and annuity&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Life reinsurance premiums increased 1.4% in 2016 compared to 2015, which declined 4.8%&nbsp;compared to 2014. The life reinsurance business produced near break-even results in 2016 and a pre-tax loss of $45&nbsp;million in 2015. Underwriting losses in 2015 included losses of $53&nbsp;million incurred in connection with certain terminated business. Our variable annuity business primarily consists of reinsurance contracts that provide guarantees on closed blocks of variable annuity business written by other insurers. Our pre-tax underwriting gains in each period of the past three years reflected changes in liabilities for guaranteed benefits, which were affected by changes in securities markets and interest rates, as well as from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins included in our liability estimates. Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (&#147;BH Primary&#148;) consists of a wide variety of independently managed insurance underwriting businesses that primarily provide a variety of commercial insurance solutions, including healthcare malpractice, workers&#146; compensation, automobile, general liability, property and various specialty coverages for small, medium and large clients. The largest of these insurers include the MedPro Group, National Indemnity Company (&#147;NICO Primary&#148;), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (&#147;BHHC&#148;), Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (&#147;BH Specialty&#148;) and Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (&#147;GUARD&#148;).

The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, MedPro Group, BHHC and GUARD. Premiums written and earned in 2015 increased 20.4% and 23.2%, respectively, over the prior year. The increases were primarily attributable to volume increases from BH Specialty, NICO Primary, BHHC and GUARD. BH Primary&#146;s combined loss ratios were 61.8% in 2016, 56.9% in 2015 and 59.6% in 2014. The comparative increase in the loss ratio in 2016 reflected comparative declines in favorable loss development of prior years&#146; loss events and higher loss ratios on current year business. While our claims development has been favorable in recent years, our primary insurers write considerable amounts of healthcare malpractice, general liability and workers&#146; compensation business, which can have extended claim-tails. It should not be assumed that the current claim experience or underwriting results will continue into the future.

We continue to hold significant cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills earning very low yields, although such yields in 2016 were higher than in 2015. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to such balances. In December 2016, Dow exercised its option to convert our $3 billion Dow preferred stock investment into common stock. Prior to its conversion, we received dividends of $255 million per annum. Interest earned declined $121&nbsp;million (12%) in 2015 versus 2014. The reduction reflected the maturities and dispositions of fixed maturity securities with higher interest rates. Dividend income increased $314&nbsp;million (9%) in 2015 versus 2014. Dividend income in 2015 included income from our investment in Restaurant Brands International, Inc. 9% Preferred Stock ($3&nbsp;billion stated value), which was acquired in December 2014. Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital, including reinvested earnings, and from net liabilities under insurance contracts or &#147;float.&#148; The major components of float are unpaid losses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities to policyholders less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $91&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016, $88&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and $84&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2014. The cost of float was negative over the last three years as our insurance business generated pre-tax underwriting gains in each year.

BNSF operates approximately 32,500 route miles of track in 28 states and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF&#146;s major business groups are classified by type of product shipped and include consumer products, coal, industrial products and agricultural products.

Pre-tax earnings were $5.7&nbsp;billion in 2016, a decrease of $1.1&nbsp;billion (16.0%)&nbsp;compared to 2015. Our total volume was approximately 9.8&nbsp;million cars/units in 2016 compared to approximately 10.3&nbsp;million in 2015. In 2016, we experienced declining demand, especially in our coal and crude oil categories. Coal had the largest decline, driven by structural changes in that business as well as competition from low natural gas prices. While natural gas prices and the amount of electricity burn will affect the demand for coal in 2017, our long-term demand outlook for U.S. and global coal consumption is lower. Freight revenues reflected comparative declines in 2016 in average revenue per car/unit (5.2%) and volumes (5.0%). The decrease in average revenue per car/unit was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and to business mix changes. The fuel price impact on fuel surcharges generally lags its impact on fuel costs. Freight revenues from consumer products were $6.5&nbsp;billion in 2016, a decline of 0.9% from 2015. The revenue decline reflected lower average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. Consumer products volumes increased primarily due to higher domestic intermodal volumes and the addition of a new automotive customer. Lower international intermodal volumes attributable to soft economic activity and excess retail inventories partially offset these increases. Freight revenues from industrial products were $4.8&nbsp;billion in 2016, a decline of 14.2% compared with 2015. The decrease reflects lower volumes, primarily for petroleum products, reflecting pipeline displacement of U.S. crude rail traffic and lower U.S. oil production. In addition, there was lower demand for steel and taconite, partially offset by increased plastics products volume. We expect low oil production and pipeline displacement will continue to negatively impact the demand for crude oil shipments in 2017. Freight revenues from agricultural products remained relatively flat at $4.2&nbsp;billion. Agricultural product volume increased by 6.3% in 2016, primarily due to higher corn, soybean and wheat exports, offsetting a decrease in average revenue per car/unit. Freight revenues from coal decreased 26.9% to $3.4&nbsp;billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting a 21.1% decline in volumes and lower average rate per car/unit. Demand for coal has declined due to reduced energy consumption, coal unit retirements, high coal stockpiles and low natural gas prices. &nbsp; 40 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Railroad (&#147;Burlington Northern Santa Fe&#148;) &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Operating expenses were $13.1&nbsp;billion in 2016, a decrease of $1.1&nbsp;billion (7.9%)&nbsp;compared to 2015, and our ratio of operating expenses to revenues increased 1.4 percentage points to 66.3%. Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $274&nbsp;million (5.4%) compared to 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower employment levels resulting from lower freight volumes and productivity improvements, partially offset by inflation. Fuel expenses declined $722&nbsp;million (27.2%)&nbsp;compared to 2015, due to lower average fuel prices and lower volumes. Purchased services declined $128&nbsp;million (5.0%) due to lower volumes and cost reductions. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $127&nbsp;million (6.3%)&nbsp;compared to 2015 due to increased assets in service reflecting our ongoing capital additions and improvement programs. Equipment rents, materials and other expense declined $123&nbsp;million (6.1%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower freight volumes and productivity improvements. Interest expense was $992&nbsp;million in 2016, an increase of $64&nbsp;million (6.9%) compared to 2015. Interest expense in 2015 was $928&nbsp;million, an increase of $95&nbsp;million (11%)&nbsp;compared to 2014. BNSF funds its capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and new debt issuances. The comparative increases in each period resulted from higher average outstanding debt. Consolidated revenues were approximately $22.0&nbsp;billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.3&nbsp;billion (5%) compared to 2014. Pre-tax earnings were $6.8&nbsp;billion in 2015, an increase of $606&nbsp;million (10%)&nbsp;over 2014. Results in 2015 benefitted from significantly improved operating performance compared to substandard service during 2014. The operational improvements in 2015 reflected the capacity added in 2014 and 2015 through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects, other operational initiatives and more favorable winter weather conditions. Our total volume was approximately 10.3&nbsp;million cars/units in 2015. During the second half of 2015 and particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced declining demand, especially in coal and certain industrial products categories. The decrease in consolidated revenues in 2015 reflected a 6% decline in average revenue per car/unit and a 0.1% decrease in volume. The decrease in average revenue per car/unit was attributable to a 55% decline in fuel surcharges ($1.6 billion) versus 2014, primarily due to lower fuel prices. The impact of lower fuel surcharge revenues affected revenues of all product lines. Freight revenues from industrial products decreased 11% in 2015 compared to 2014 to $5.6&nbsp;billion. The decrease reflected lower volumes for petroleum products, frac sand and steel products and lower average revenue per car/unit. Freight revenues from agricultural products increased 2% in 2015 to approximately $4.2&nbsp;billion as compared to revenues in 2014. The increase in 2015 was attributable to higher domestic grain shipments and milo exports. Freight revenues from coal decreased 7% to $4.6&nbsp;billion in 2015 compared to 2014. The revenue decline was primarily due to lower average rates per car. Coal volume increased 1% primarily due to higher demand in the early part of the year as customers restocked coal inventories. Freight revenues from consumer products were $6.6&nbsp;billion in 2015, a decline of 6% from 2014. The revenue decline reflected lower average rates per car/unit, partially offset by volume increases of 1%. In the first quarter of 2015, we experienced a decline in international intermodal volume attributable to diversions of freight from U.S. West Coast ports to other import gateways as a result of the port productivity slow-down from port labor disruptions. Over the remainder of 2015, we experienced increased volume, as port productivity improvements allowed the backlog to clear, as well as from higher demand. Operating expenses were $14.3&nbsp;billion in 2015, a decrease of $2&nbsp;billion (12%)&nbsp;compared to 2014. The ratio of operating expenses to revenues declined 4.9 percentage points to 64.9% as compared to 2014. Compensation and benefits expenses were relatively flat versus 2014. In response to weakening customer demand in the latter half of 2015, employment levels were reduced. Fuel expenses declined $1.8&nbsp;billion (41%)&nbsp;compared to 2014, reflecting significantly lower average fuel prices, improved efficiency and lower gross ton miles volume. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $122&nbsp;million (6%)&nbsp;compared to 2014 as a result of lower capitalized software amortization expenses, partially offset by increased depreciation expense attributable to increased levels of railroad assets in service.

(&#147;AltaLink&#148;), a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada and a diversified portfolio of independent power projects. In addition, BHE also operates the second-largest residential real estate brokerage firm and one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States. &nbsp; 41 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Utilities and Energy (&#147;Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company&#148;) &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; The rates our regulated businesses charge customers for energy and services are based, in large part, on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval. To the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in the approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected. Revenues and earnings of BHE are summarized below (in&nbsp;millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenues &nbsp; &nbsp; Earnings &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; PacifiCorp &nbsp; $ 5,245 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 5,279 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 5,315 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,105 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,026 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,010 &nbsp; MidAmerican Energy Company &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,668 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,554 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,900 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 392 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 292 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 270 &nbsp; NV Energy &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,925 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,382 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,279 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 559 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 586 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 549 &nbsp; Northern Powergrid &nbsp; &nbsp; 997 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,141 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,284 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 367 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 460 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 527 &nbsp; Natural gas pipelines &nbsp; &nbsp; 986 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,018 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,093 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 413 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 401 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 379 &nbsp; Other energy businesses &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,223 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,321 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,582 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 377 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 394 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 264 &nbsp; Real estate brokerage &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,815 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,536 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,161 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 225 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 191 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 139 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 17,859 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 18,231 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 17,614 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Earnings before corporate interest and income taxes (&#147;EBIT&#148;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,438 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,350 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,138 &nbsp; Corporate interest &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 465 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 499 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 427 &nbsp; Income taxes and noncontrolling interests &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 686 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 719 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 829 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 2,287 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 2,132 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,882 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and Wyoming. PacifiCorp&#146;s revenues were $5.25&nbsp;billion in 2016, slightly lower than 2015. Revenues reflected increased retail revenues and lower wholesale and other operating revenues. The increase in retail revenues was primarily due to higher retail rates as volumes were relatively unchanged. The declines in wholesale revenues were attributable to lower volumes and average prices. EBIT in 2016 increased $79&nbsp;million (7.7%) from 2015, primarily due to increased gross margins (operating revenues less cost of sales), reflecting lower fuel prices and changes in fuel mix. Revenues declined $36&nbsp;million (1%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Wholesale and other revenues declined $129&nbsp;million, principally due to lower wholesale prices and volumes and lower renewable energy credit revenue, while retail revenues increased compared to 2014, reflecting higher average rates partially offset by slightly lower volumes. EBIT increased $16&nbsp;million (2%) in 2015 compared to 2014. Gross margins increased $109&nbsp;million versus 2014, as energy costs declined more than revenues. The increase in gross margins substantially offset an increase in depreciation and amortization expense ($35 million) due to increased plant-in-service, lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($18 million) and the impact of the recognition in 2014 of expected insurance recoveries on fire losses. MidAmerican Energy Company MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. Revenues increased $114&nbsp;million (4.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015. Revenues in 2016 included increased electric revenues ($148 million), which were somewhat offset by lower natural gas revenues ($24 million). The increase in electric revenues resulted primarily from a 3.8% increase in customer volumes and higher rates. Wholesale and other revenues increased primarily due to increased average wholesale prices and higher transmission revenue. The decline in natural gas revenues was primarily due to lower average per-unit costs of gas sold ($42 million), which is offset in cost of sales, partly offset by higher wholesale volumes. EBIT increased $100&nbsp;million (34.2%) in 2016 from 2015. The increase in EBIT was primarily due to increased gross margins from electric revenues and lower operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization from additional assets placed in service, and higher interest expense. MEC&#146;s revenues declined $346&nbsp;million (12%) in 2015 from 2014. Regulated natural gas revenues declined $335&nbsp;million, which was primarily attributable to lower average per-unit cost of gas sold, which is substantially offset in lower cost of sales. Regulated electric revenues increased slightly, due primarily to higher retail rates in Iowa and higher volumes, partially offset by lower average wholesale prices. The increases in regulated electric rates in Iowa are attributable to higher retail rates and changes in rate structure approved in August 2014, which results in a greater differential between higher rates from June to September and lower rates in the remaining months. &nbsp; 42 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Utilities and Energy (&#147;Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company&#148;) &nbsp;(Continued) MidAmerican Energy Company&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; EBIT increased $22&nbsp;million (8%) in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting an increase in gross margins ($107 million), partially offset by increases in depreciation expense from new wind generation and other plant-in-service ($56 million), interest expense ($17 million) and lower allowances for equity funds used during construction ($19 million). The increase in gross margins derived primarily from the regulated electric business, which benefitted from the aforementioned changes in Iowa rates and rate structure and lower fuel and purchased power costs. In addition, EBIT included a gain of $13&nbsp;million in 2015 from the sale of a generating facility lease. NV Energy NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. Revenues were approximately $2.9&nbsp;billion in 2016, a decrease of $457&nbsp;million (13.5%) versus 2015. The decline was primarily attributable to lower electric retail rates resulting from lower energy costs. Electric retail volumes in 2016 were flat compared to 2015. EBIT fell $27&nbsp;million (4.6%) compared to 2015. The decline in revenues was substantially offset by a decline in energy costs. Operating expenses increased $39&nbsp;million (4%) and interest expense decreased $17&nbsp;million (6.6%). The increase in operating expenses reflected higher depreciation and amortization and reductions in certain accrued liabilities in 2015. Revenues and EBIT were $3.4&nbsp;billion and $586&nbsp;million in 2015, representing increases of $103&nbsp;million (3%)&nbsp;and $37&nbsp;million (7%) over 2014. The increase in revenues was due primarily to higher retail electric revenues reflecting increased customers and higher volumes. The increase in EBIT was attributable to an increase in gross margins ($82 million) and lower interest expense ($22 million), partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization ($31 million) and higher other operating expenses, including increased energy efficiency costs. Northern Powergrid Revenues declined $144&nbsp;million (12.6%) to $997&nbsp;million in 2016, primarily due to the impact of a stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar ($127 million) and lower distribution revenues. EBIT declined $93&nbsp;million (20.2%) to $367&nbsp;million. The decline was due to lower distribution revenues and the stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, as well as increases in depreciation expense from increased assets in service and higher asset impairment charges. Revenues declined $143&nbsp;million (11%) in 2015 versus 2014, reflecting the adverse impact of the stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar ($90 million) and comparatively lower distribution revenues. The decline in distribution revenues reflected lower rates due mainly to the new price control period effective April&nbsp;1, 2015. EBIT declined $67&nbsp;million (13%)&nbsp;compared to 2014, reflecting the adverse effects of the stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar and lower distribution revenues partially offset by lower interest expense ($13 million). Natural Gas Pipelines Revenues declined $32&nbsp;million (3.1%) in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of lower gas sales from balancing activities and lower transportation revenues from lower volumes and rates, in part due to comparatively milder temperatures in the first quarter of 2016. EBIT increased $12&nbsp;million (3.0%) versus 2015, reflecting lower interest expense, resulting from lower average debt balances and lower operating expenses, partly offset by the lower transportation revenues. Revenues declined $75&nbsp;million (7%) in 2015 versus 2014, which was primarily due to lower gas sales as a result of reduced system and operational balancing activities, partially offset by higher transportation revenues. EBIT increased $22&nbsp;million (6%)&nbsp;as compared to 2014, as decreased costs of gas sold and lower operating expenses more than offset the decline in revenues. Other energy businesses Revenues declined $98&nbsp;million (4.2%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The decline in comparative revenues was principally attributable to lower revenues from AltaLink and from our unregulated retail services business. AltaLink&#146;s year-to-date revenue decline reflected the impact of a regulatory decision in the second quarter of 2016 that resulted in one-time net reductions in revenue, which more than offset increased revenues from additional assets placed in service. The regulatory decision changed the timing of when construction-in-progress expenditures included in the rate base are billable to customers and earned in revenues, but had no impact on net earnings, as one-time reductions in expenses offset the one-time revenue reduction. EBIT declined $17&nbsp;million (4.3%) compared to 2015, primarily due to lower earnings from our renewable energy businesses, primarily due to higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in service. &nbsp; 43 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Utilities and Energy (&#147;Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company&#148;) &nbsp;(Continued) Other energy businesses&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Revenues of other energy businesses increased $739&nbsp;million (46.7%) in 2015 over revenues in 2014, while EBIT increased $130&nbsp;million (49%)&nbsp;versus 2014. Revenues and EBIT in 2015 reflect the acquisition of AltaLink on December&nbsp;1, 2014. AltaLink&#146;s revenues and EBIT in 2015 were $621&nbsp;million and $170&nbsp;million, respectively. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in solar capacity placed in service. Excluding the acquisition of AltaLink, the impact of higher revenues in 2015 was more than offset by higher operating, depreciation and interest expenses. Real estate brokerage Revenues increased 11.0% to $2.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased closed brokerage transactions (primarily resulting from business acquisitions) and a 2% increase in average home sales prices, as well as higher mortgage revenues. EBIT increased $34&nbsp;million (17.8%) in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the increases in mortgage revenues. Real estate brokerage revenues and EBIT increased 17% and 37%, respectively, in 2015 compared to 2014. The revenue increase reflected comparative increases in closed transactions and average home prices and the impact of business acquisitions. The increase in EBIT was primarily due to the increased revenues, net of commission expense, as well as a lower operating expense to revenue ratio as compared to 2014. Corporate interest and income taxes Corporate interest includes interest on unsecured debt issued by BHE and borrowings from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries in connection with BHE&#146;s acquisitions of NV Energy and AltaLink. The decline in corporate interest in 2016 was primarily due to lower average borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries. In 2015, corporate interest expense increased over the prior year due to new borrowings in connection with the AltaLink acquisition. BHE&#146;s consolidated effective income tax rates were approximately 14% in 2016, 16% in 2015, and 23% in 2014. BHE&#146;s effective income tax rates regularly reflect significant production tax credits from wind-powered electricity generation placed in service. In addition, pre-tax earnings of Northern Powergrid and AltaLink are taxed at lower statutory rates in the United Kingdom and Canada compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate. BHE&#146;s effective rates in 2016 and 2015 also included reductions in deferred income tax liabilities resulting from enacted statutory income tax rate decreases in the United Kingdom and deferred state income tax benefits. Manufacturing, Service and Retailing A summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, retailing and service businesses follows (in&nbsp;millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Revenues &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Earnings&nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Manufacturing &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 46,506 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 36,136 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 36,773 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,211 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,893 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,811 &nbsp; Service and retailing &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 73,553 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 71,689 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 60,916 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,251 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,222 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,981 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 120,059 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 107,825 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 97,689 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-tax earnings &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,462 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,115 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,792 &nbsp; Income taxes and noncontrolling interests &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,831 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,432 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,324 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 5,631 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,683 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,468 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which were primarily from the amortization of identified intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions. The after-tax acquisition accounting expenses excluded from earnings above were $771&nbsp;million in 2016, $476&nbsp;million in 2015 and $496&nbsp;million in 2014. These expenses are included in &#147;other&#148; in the summary of earnings on page 32 and in the &#147;other&#148; earnings section on page 51. &nbsp; 44 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Manufacturing, Service and Retailing &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Manufacturing Our manufacturing group includes a variety of businesses that produce industrial, building and consumer products. Industrial products businesses include specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (&#147;Lubrizol&#148;)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (&#147;IMC&#148;)), equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International), and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Marmon and Scott Fetzer). Beginning on January&nbsp;29, 2016, our industrial products group also includes Precision Castparts Corp. (&#147;PCC&#148;), a leading manufacturer of complex metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets. Our building products businesses include flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore), and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek). Our consumer products businesses include leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports), and beginning February&nbsp;29, 2016, the Duracell Company (&#147;Duracell&#148;), a leading manufacturer of high performance alkaline batteries. This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline). A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our manufacturing operations follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Revenues &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-tax earnings &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Industrial products &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 24,702 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 16,760 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 17,622 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,209 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,994 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 3,159 &nbsp; Building products &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10,772 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10,316 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10,124 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,178 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,167 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 896 &nbsp; Consumer products &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11,032 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 9,060 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 9,027 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 824 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 732 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 756 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 46,506 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 36,136 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 36,773 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,211 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,893 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,811 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aggregate revenues in 2016 were approximately $46.5&nbsp;billion, an increase of approximately $10.4&nbsp;billion (28.7%) over 2015. Pre-tax earnings were approximately $6.2&nbsp;billion in 2016, an increase of $1.3&nbsp;billion (26.9%) compared to 2015. Excluding PCC and Duracell, manufacturing revenues were flat and pre-tax earnings declined compared to 2015. Industrial products Industrial products revenues increased approximately $7.9&nbsp;billion (47.4%) in 2016 versus 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of PCC, partially offset by revenue declines of $859&nbsp;million (5.1%) across our other businesses. Sales volumes of our other businesses declined compared to 2015, reflecting sluggish demand for many product categories, particularly for products sold to businesses in the oil and gas and heavy equipment industries. In addition, lower average costs of oil-based raw materials and metals and increased competitive pressures continued to lower average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings increased $1.2&nbsp;billion (40.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting the inclusion of PCC, partially offset by comparative earnings declines from our other businesses. Lubrizol&#146;s earnings in 2016 included pre-tax losses of $365&nbsp;million in 2016 related to the disposition in the fourth quarter of an underperforming business. Earnings from several of Marmon&#146;s manufacturing businesses and Lubrizol&#146;s continuing operations declined, while earnings from IMC increased slightly. Generally, our industrial products manufacturers experienced a combination of weaker customer demand, sales price and mix changes, and increased restructuring costs, which were partly offset by benefits from cost containment initiatives and lower average material prices. Revenues declined $862&nbsp;million (5%) in 2015 versus 2014. The foreign currency translation impact of a stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar produced approximately $782&nbsp;million of the comparative revenue decline. In addition, commodity cost deflation in petroleum and metals used in certain of our products resulted in lower average selling prices, in particular for specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, copper wire and plumbing products. Certain of our businesses experienced slowing customer demand over the last half of 2015 as the decline in oil prices and competitive pressures resulted in significantly lower sales volumes to customers in or related to the oil and gas industry. These negative factors were partly offset by revenues from bolt-on acquisitions of Lubrizol. Pre-tax earnings declined $165&nbsp;million (5%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The comparative declines in earnings reflected the adverse impact of the stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, partially offset by earnings from bolt-on acquisitions, lower average commodity-based material costs, and actions taken in response to the slowing sales volumes previously referenced. Such actions address cost structures and exiting lower margin business. &nbsp; 45 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Manufacturing, Service and Retailing &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Building products Building products revenues increased $456&nbsp;million (4.4%) in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting volume-driven revenue increases by MiTek, Johns Manville, Acme and Shaw, as well as revenues from bolt-on acquisitions by Shaw and MiTek. The revenue increase reflected increased unit sales across several product categories, partly offset by lower average sales prices and changes in product mix. Pre-tax earnings increased $11&nbsp;million (0.9%) in 2016 compared to 2015.&nbsp;The favorable effects of increased sales volume and lower manufacturing costs in 2016 (attributable to deflation in certain commodity unit costs) were offset by increased charges for asset impairments, pension settlements and environmental claims. Revenues increased $192&nbsp;million (2%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The revenue increase reflected sales volume increases at Shaw, Johns Manville and MiTek, as well as the impact of bolt-on business acquisitions, partially offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar ($165 million). Pre-tax earnings increased $271&nbsp;million (30%)&nbsp;compared to 2014. The overall increase in earnings was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in revenues and lower average raw material and energy costs, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and increased restructuring charges. Shaw, Johns Manville and Benjamin Moore generated most of the comparative increase in earnings. Consumer products Consumer products revenues were approximately $11.0&nbsp;billion in 2016, an increase of approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion (21.8%) compared to 2015. The increase reflected the inclusion of Duracell and a 12% increase in Forest River&#146;s revenues, which was primarily attributable to increased unit sales. Apparel revenues in 2016 declined $81&nbsp;million (1.9%) compared to 2015, reflecting lower footwear sales and the impact of a divestiture by Fruit of the Loom in 2015. Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $92&nbsp;million (12.6%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The earnings increase reflected increased earnings from Forest River and apparel and footwear businesses, partly offset by pre-tax losses of Duracell. From its acquisition date, Duracell incurred approximately $109&nbsp;million in transition, business integration and restructuring costs. Forest River generated a pre-tax earnings increase of 28%, primarily due to increased sales volumes and higher gross margins. Earnings of our apparel businesses increased 22% in 2016, primarily attributable to lower restructuring costs and a loss in 2015 from the disposition of a Fruit of the Loom operation, partly offset by lower earnings from our footwear businesses. Revenues of our consumer products manufacturers were approximately $9.1&nbsp;billion in 2015, relatively unchanged from 2014. Forest River&#146;s revenues increased 6% compared to 2014, due to a 4% increase in unit sales and increased average prices. Apparel revenues in 2015 declined 4% compared to 2014. The decline in apparel revenues was attributable to lower volume and the negative impact of foreign currency translation resulting from a stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar. Pre-tax earnings declined $24&nbsp;million (3%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The decline was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2015 from the disposition of an unprofitable Fruit of the Loom operation and lower earnings from our footwear businesses, partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River. Service and retailing Our service and retailing businesses are comprised of a large group of independently managed businesses engaged in a variety of activities. A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of these operations follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Revenues &nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-tax&nbsp;earnings &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 Service &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 10,386 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 10,201 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 9,854 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,161 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,156 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,202 Retailing &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15,092 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13,265 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,422 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 659 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 564 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 344 McLane Company &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 48,075 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 48,223 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 46,640 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 431 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 502 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 435 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 73,553 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 71,689 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 60,916 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 2,251 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 2,222 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,981 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Service Our service businesses offer fractional ownership programs for general aviation aircraft (NetJets) and high technology training to operators of aircraft (FlightSafety). We also distribute electronic components (TTI) and franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen). Services also include the electronic distribution of corporate news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), publication of newspapers and other publications (Buffalo News and the BH Media Group) and operation of a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). We also offer third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage). &nbsp; 46 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Manufacturing, Service and Retailing &nbsp;(Continued) Service&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Service revenues increased 1.8% to approximately $10.4&nbsp;billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to revenue increases from TTI and Charter Brokerage partly offset by a revenue decrease from NetJets. TTI&#146;s revenues increased 7.2%, primarily due to sales volume increases in Asia, Europe and through the Internet, while the increase from Charter Brokerage primarily derived from a commodity trading business launched in 2015. NetJets&#146; revenues decreased 2.0% reflecting lower aircraft sales. Pre-tax earnings were $1.2&nbsp;billion in 2016, relatively unchanged versus 2015, reflecting increased earnings from NetJets and lower earnings from our newspaper operations. NetJets&#146; earnings increased 19%, primarily due to lower subcontracting expense and a decline in losses from aircraft impairments and dispositions, partly offset by increases in depreciation and restructuring charges and reduced aircraft sale margins. TTI&#146;s earnings were relatively unchanged, as changes in geographic sales mix and price competition produced lower gross margin rates, substantially offsetting the aforementioned revenue increase. Revenues increased $347&nbsp;million (3.5%) in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase included a 5% increase in NetJets&#146; revenues and the impact of the acquisitions of Charter Brokerage and WPLG during 2014, partly offset by reduced revenues from our newspaper operations. The increase in NetJets&#146; revenues was attributable to a 50% increase in aircraft sales, partially offset by lower flight operations revenue. Pre-tax earnings declined $46&nbsp;million in 2015 compared to 2014. Earnings benefitted from the WPLG and Charter Brokerage acquisitions, which were more than offset by lower earnings from NetJets. Earnings declined at NetJets as the impact of increased aircraft sales margins was more than offset by increased personnel, aircraft subcontracting and maintenance expenses. A portion of the increase in personnel costs pertained to lump-sum payments made in connection with a collective bargaining agreement reached with our pilots in the fourth quarter of 2015. Retailing Our retailing businesses include four distinct home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan&#146;s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Our retailers also include Berkshire Hathaway Automotive (&#147;BHA&#148;), which we acquired in the first quarter of 2015. BHA currently includes 83 auto dealerships. BHA sells new and pre-owned automobiles, offering repair and other related services and products, and also includes two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a distributor of automotive fluid maintenance products. Our other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See&#146;s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (&#147;Louis&#148;), a Germany-based retailer of motorcycle accessories acquired in the second quarter of 2015. Retailing revenues increased $1.8&nbsp;billion (13.8%) in 2016 to $15.1&nbsp;billion as compared to 2015. The increase in revenues reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions during 2015, which accounted for approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion of the comparative increase. Home furnishings revenues increased $227&nbsp;million (7.8%), primarily due to new stores opened in 2015 by Nebraska Furniture Mart and Jordan&#146;s, as well as modest organic growth. Pre-tax earnings increased $95&nbsp;million (16.8%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions and increased earnings from most of our other retailers, which benefitted from a combination of revenue increases and cost savings initiatives. Revenues increased approximately $8.8&nbsp;billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase reflected the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions, which together contributed revenues of approximately $8.3&nbsp;billion. Revenues of our home furnishings retailers increased $572&nbsp;million (24%)&nbsp;over 2014, driven by Nebraska Furniture Mart, which opened a new store in March 2015 and from increases at R.C. Willey and Jordan&#146;s. Pre-tax earnings increased $220&nbsp;million (64%)&nbsp;compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the BHA and Louis acquisitions. McLane Company McLane operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (&#147;grocery&#148;) and to restaurants (&#147;foodservice&#148;). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (&#147;beverage&#148;). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales volumes and very low profit margins and have several significant customers, including Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and Yum! Brands. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on McLane&#146;s periodic revenues and earnings. &nbsp; 47 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Manufacturing, Service and Retailing &nbsp;(Continued) McLane Company&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Revenues were $48.1&nbsp;billion in 2016, a decline of $148&nbsp;million (0.3%) relative to 2015. In 2016, we experienced a comparative decline in grocery revenues, partly offset by an increase in foodservice revenues. Earnings were $431&nbsp;million in 2016, a decrease of $71&nbsp;million (14%) compared to 2015. The reduced earnings was primarily due to a reduction in McLane&#146;s operating margin (ratio of earnings to revenues). The decline was primarily due to increased employee related costs. Competition in our grocery and foodservice businesses has been and will likely continue to be intense and our ability to control operating costs is a key factor in maintaining profitability. Additionally, earnings in 2015 included a gain of $19&nbsp;million from the disposition of a subsidiary. Revenues increased $1.6&nbsp;billion (3%) in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting revenue increases in the foodservice unit (6%), beverage unit (8%)&nbsp;and grocery unit (2%). Pre-tax earnings increased $67&nbsp;million (15%) in 2015 versus 2014. Pre-tax earnings in 2015 included the aforementioned gain from the sale of a subsidiary and otherwise benefitted from lower fuel and trucking costs. Finance and Financial Products Our finance and financial products businesses include manufactured housing and finance (Clayton Homes), transportation equipment manufacturing and leasing businesses (UTLX and XTRA, and together, &#147;transportation equipment leasing&#148;), as well as other leasing and financing activities. A summary of revenues and earnings from our finance and financial products businesses follows (in&nbsp;millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Revenues &nbsp;&nbsp; Earnings &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 Manufactured housing and finance &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 4,230 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,576 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,310 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 744 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 706 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 558 Transportation equipment leasing &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,650 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,540 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,427 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 959 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 909 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 827 Other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 795 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 848 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 789 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 427 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 471 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 454 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 7,675 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 6,964 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 6,526 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pre-tax earnings &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,130 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,086 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,839 Income taxes and noncontrolling interests &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 703 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 708 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 596 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,427 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,378 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,243 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Manufactured housing and finance Clayton Homes&#146; revenues increased $654&nbsp;million (18%) in 2016 compared to 2015, attributable to a 30% increase in revenues from home sales, primarily due to a 25% increase in units sold and product mix changes. Interest and other financial service income increased 1.8% from 2015. Pre-tax earnings increased $38&nbsp;million (5.4%) compared to 2015. Earnings benefitted from increased home sales and improved manufacturing and retailing operating margins, partly offset by lower earnings from lending and financial services, which were negatively impacted by increased insurance losses. A significant portion of Clayton&#146;s earnings are generated from lending activities, which in recent years benefitted from relatively low delinquency rates and loan losses and from declining borrowing costs attributable to lower average interest rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, Clayton Homes&#146; installment loan portfolio was approximately $13.3&nbsp;billion and approximately 94% of the loan balances were current in terms of payment status. Revenues and pre-tax earnings increased $266&nbsp;million (8%)&nbsp;and $148&nbsp;million (27%) in 2015, respectively, as compared to 2014. The revenue increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in home unit sales. The increase in earnings was primarily due to lower interest expense, improved manufacturing results, relatively low delinquency rates and lower loss rates on loan foreclosures. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower average balances. Transportation equipment leasing Transportation equipment leasing revenues increased $110&nbsp;million (4.3%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase derived primarily from the acquisition of General Electric Company&#146;s (&#147;GE&#148;) tank car fleet and its railcar repair services business in 2015 and increased rates and tank car additions. These increases were partly offset by lower utilization rates, unfavorable foreign currency effects, lower crane lease demand in North America and reduced volume related to oil and gas markets. &nbsp; 48 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Finance and Financial Products &nbsp;(Continued) Transportation equipment leasing&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Pre-tax earnings increased $50&nbsp;million (5.5%) in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth and lower depreciation rates on certain tank car assets, partially offset by higher repair costs and interest expense on new borrowings from a Berkshire financing subsidiary. Significant portions of transportation leasing expenses, such as depreciation, do not vary proportionately to revenue changes and therefore changes in revenues can disproportionately impact earnings. Revenues increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase reflected increased railcar lease rates, a larger fleet of railcars, higher volumes in our Australian crane business, increased over-the-road trailers on lease and gains on dispositions of trailers. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange attributable to a stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar and lower volumes in our North American crane leasing business due to declines in oil drilling activity. As previously mentioned, we acquired GE&#146;s tank car fleet on September&nbsp;30, 2015, which included approximately 25,000 tank cars. We also acquired several railcar repair and maintenance facilities at the end of 2015. Pre-tax earnings increased $82&nbsp;million (10%) in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the revenue growth discussed above, which more than offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and higher railcar repair and warranty costs and depreciation attributable to a larger fleet size. Other Other finance activities include CORT furniture leasing, our share of the earnings of a commercial mortgage servicing business (&#147;Berkadia&#148;) in which we own a 50% interest, and interest and dividends from a portfolio of investments. Other earnings decreased $44&nbsp;million in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting lower earnings from investment securities, partly offset by increased earnings from CORT and Berkadia. Other earnings also includes income from interest rate spreads charged on borrowings by a Berkshire financing subsidiary that are used to finance Clayton Homes&#146; installment loans and beginning in 2016, UTLX&#146;s fleet of rail/tank cars held for lease. Offsetting expenses ($74&nbsp;million in 2016, $62&nbsp;million in 2015 and $68&nbsp;million in 2014) were included in Clayton Homes&#146; and UTLX&#146;s results. Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses A summary of investment and derivative gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Investment gains/losses &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 7,635 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 9,399 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 4,272 &nbsp; Other-than-temporary impairments &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (82 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (26 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (697 )&nbsp; Derivative gains/losses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 751 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 974 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 506 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,304 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10,347 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,081 &nbsp; Income taxes and noncontrolling interests &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,807 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,622 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 760 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net gains/losses &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,497 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 6,725 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,321 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Investment gains/losses Investment gains/losses arise primarily from the sale, redemption or exchange of investments. The timing of gains or losses can have a material effect on periodic earnings. Investment gains and losses included in earnings usually have minimal impact on the periodic changes in our consolidated shareholders&#146; equity since most of our investments are recorded at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in shareholders&#146; equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We believe the amount of investment gains/losses included in earnings in any given period typically has little analytical or predictive value. Our decisions to sell securities are not motivated by the impact that the resulting gains or losses will have on our reported earnings. Although we do not consider investment gains and losses as necessarily meaningful or useful in evaluating our periodic results, we are providing information to explain the nature of such gains and losses when reflected in our earnings. &nbsp; 49 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Investment and Derivative Gains/Losses &nbsp;(Continued) Investment gains/losses&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Pre-tax investment gains were $7.6&nbsp;billion in 2016 and included gains of $2.4&nbsp;billion from the sale to Mars Inc. of our Wrigley preferred stock investment, $610&nbsp;million from the Kraft Heinz Preferred Stock redemption, $1.2 billion from the Dow Preferred Stock conversion into common stock, and $1.1&nbsp;billion from the exchange of shares of P&amp;G common stock for 100% of the common stock of Duracell. Income tax expense allocated to investment gains included a benefit from the reduction of certain deferred income tax liabilities in connection with the exchange of P&amp;G common stock for Duracell. Pre-tax investment gains included non-cash holding gains related to our investment in Kraft Heinz of $6.8&nbsp;billion in 2015. In connection with its acquisition of Kraft Foods on July&nbsp;2, 2015, Kraft Heinz issued new shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of Kraft Foods common stock, thus reducing Berkshire&#146;s ownership interest in Kraft Heinz by approximately 50%. Under the equity method of accounting, such transactions are treated by the investor as if it sold a portion of its interests. Pre-tax investment gains were $4.3&nbsp;billion in 2014, which included gains of approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion realized in connection with the exchanges of common stock of Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings Company for 100% of the common stock of a specified subsidiary of each of those companies. Each exchange transaction in 2016 and 2014 was structured as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no income taxes are payable on the excess of the fair value of the businesses received over the tax-basis of the common stock exchanged. Other-than-temporary impairments (&#147;OTTI&#148;) OTTI charges in 2016 and 2015 were not significant and in 2014 were $697&nbsp;million, predominantly relating to our investment in equity securities of Tesco PLC. Although we have periodically recorded OTTI charges in earnings in past years, we continue to hold some of those securities. If the market values of those investments increase following the date we recorded OTTI charges, the increases are included in shareholders&#146; equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and not in earnings. When recorded, OTTI charges have no impact whatsoever on the asset values otherwise recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets or on our consolidated shareholders&#146; equity. In addition, the recognition of such losses in earnings rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income does not necessarily indicate that sales are planned and sales ultimately may not occur for a number of years. Furthermore, the recognition of OTTI charges does not necessarily indicate that the loss in value of the security is permanent or that the market price of the security will not subsequently increase to and ultimately exceed our original cost. Derivative gains/losses Derivative gains/losses primarily represented the changes in fair value of our credit default and equity index put option contract liabilities. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and can be significant, reflecting the volatility of underlying credit and equity markets and the changes in the inputs used to measure such liabilities. Changes in the values of our equity index put option contract liabilities produced pre-tax gains of $662&nbsp;million in 2016, which were primarily due to increases in the index values, favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes and shorter remaining contract durations, partly offset by lower interest rates. Our equity index put option contracts produced pre-tax gains of approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion in 2015, which were primarily attributable to a stronger U.S.&nbsp;Dollar and shorter remaining durations. These contracts produced pre-tax gains of $108&nbsp;million in 2014. Such gains reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and generally higher index values, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate assumptions. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of our equity put option contracts was approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion and our recorded liability was approximately $2.9&nbsp;billion. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our equity index put option contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates (beginning in 2018), and will be based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. In July 2016, our remaining credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty and we paid the counterparty $195&nbsp;million. This contract produced pre-tax earnings of $89&nbsp;million in 2016, pre-tax losses of $34&nbsp;million in 2015 and pre-tax earnings of $397&nbsp;million in 2014. We have no further exposure to losses under credit default contracts. &nbsp; 50 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Other A summary of after-tax other earnings (losses) which include corporate income (including income from our investments in Kraft Heinz), expenses and income taxes not allocated to operating businesses is summarized below (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2016&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Kraft Heinz earnings &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 706 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 841 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 653 &nbsp; Acquisition accounting expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (846 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (515 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (531 )&nbsp; Corporate interest expense &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (97 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (191 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (153 )&nbsp; Other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (106 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (105 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (114 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net earnings (losses) attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (343 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 30 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ (145 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reduced earnings in 2016 from our investments in Kraft Heinz were due to lower dividends from our Preferred Stock investment, which was redeemed in June 2016, somewhat offset by increased equity method earnings from our common stock investment. Other earnings also include charges from the application of the acquisition method in connection with Berkshire&#146;s business acquisitions. Such charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions, which we view as corporate expenses. Corporate interest expense includes after-tax foreign exchange gains of $159&nbsp;million in 2016 and losses of $45&nbsp;million in 2015 with respect to Euro denominated debt issued by Berkshire in March 2015 (&#128;3.0&nbsp;billion par) and March 2016 (&#128;2.75&nbsp;billion par). Excluding foreign currency effects, after-tax corporate interest expense was $256&nbsp;million in 2016 and $146&nbsp;million in 2015. The increase in 2016 was attributable to increased average outstanding debt. Financial Condition Our balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base. Our consolidated shareholders&#146; equity at December&nbsp;31, 2016 was $283.0&nbsp;billion, an increase of $27.5&nbsp;billion since December&nbsp;31, 2015. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in 2016 were $24.1&nbsp;billion. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $70.9&nbsp;billion, and investments (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) of $158.3&nbsp;billion. In January 2016, we used cash of approximately $32.1&nbsp;billion to fund the acquisition of PCC, which we funded through a combination of cash on hand and $10&nbsp;billion borrowed under a 364-day revolving credit agreement. We repaid these borrowings following our issuance in March 2016, of &#128;2.75&nbsp;billion and $5.5&nbsp;billion of senior unsecured notes. In August 2016, we issued $750&nbsp;million of senior unsecured notes to replace $750&nbsp;million of maturing notes. In January 2017, Berkshire issued new senior notes aggregating &#128;1.1&nbsp;billion and repaid $1.1&nbsp;billion of maturing senior notes. There are no other parent company term debt maturities in 2017. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (conducted by BNSF and BHE) maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. In 2016, capital expenditures included $5.1&nbsp;billion by BHE and $3.8&nbsp;billion by BNSF. Aggregate capital expenditures of these businesses are forecasted to be $8.6&nbsp;billion in 2017. We expect future capital expenditures will be funded by cash flows from operations and debt issuances. BNSF&#146;s outstanding debt was approximately $22.0&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, an increase of $307&nbsp;million from December&nbsp;31, 2015. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries, excluding its borrowings from Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, were approximately $37.0&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, an increase of approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2015. BNSF and BHE debt maturities in 2017 will be $3.6&nbsp;billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries and is not committed to provide capital to support BNSF or BHE or any of their subsidiaries. Finance and financial products assets were approximately $41.7&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2.7&nbsp;billion since December&nbsp;31, 2015. Finance assets consist primarily of loans and finance receivables, various types of property held for lease, and cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury Bills and other investments. In September 2016, a Berkshire finance subsidiary received approximately $4.6&nbsp;billion from the sale of its Wrigley preferred stock investment. &nbsp; 51 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Financial Condition &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Finance and financial products liabilities were approximately $19.7&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion compared to December&nbsp;31, 2015. The increase was attributable to $3.5&nbsp;billion of debt issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (&#147;BHFC&#148;) in March, partly offset by lower derivative contract liabilities. The debt proceeds were used to fund loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and to fund a portion of existing assets held for lease by our UTLX railcar leasing business. In January 2017, BHFC issued new senior notes aggregating $1.3&nbsp;billion due in 2019 and 2020 and repaid $1.05&nbsp;billion of maturing notes. Over the remainder of 2017, an additional $1.75&nbsp;billion of BHFC senior notes will mature. While we currently intend to have BHFC issue additional notes in 2017 to replace the maturing debt, the amount to be issued will be based on prevailing market conditions. Berkshire&#146;s Board of Directors has authorized Berkshire to repurchase its Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B common shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares at management&#146;s discretion and there is no obligation to repurchase any shares. We expect the program to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase shares if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire&#146;s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20&nbsp;billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases under the program in 2016. Contractual Obligations We are party to contracts associated with ongoing business and financing activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as notes payable, which require future payments on contractually specified dates and in fixed and determinable amounts. Other obligations pertain to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as minimum rentals under operating leases and certain purchase obligations, and are not currently reflected in the financial statements, but will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. The timing and/or amount of the payments under certain contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from estimates reflected in the table that follows. Most significantly, the timing and amount of future payments arising under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of claim settlement activities or events. In addition, obligations arising under life, annuity and health insurance benefits are contingent on future premiums, allowances, mortality, morbidity, expenses and policy lapse rates, as applicable. These amounts are included in the following table based on the liability estimates reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Although certain insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and life, annuity and health benefits are recoverable under reinsurance contracts, those receivables recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are not reflected in the table. A summary of contractual obligations as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated payments due by period &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2018-2019 &nbsp;&nbsp; 2020-2021 &nbsp;&nbsp; After 2021 Notes payable and other borrowings, including interest &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 152,519 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 14,038 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 26,047 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 14,396 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 98,038 Operating leases &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8,285 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,337 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,168 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,610 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,170 Purchase obligations (1) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 38,189 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11,072 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7,560 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4,937 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14,620 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (2) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 78,351 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,591 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17,684 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9,791 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 33,285 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits (3) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30,705 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,299 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 323 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 490 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28,593 Other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13,173 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,221 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 909 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,639 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8,404 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 321,222 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 47,558 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 54,691 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 32,863 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 186,110 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) &nbsp; Primarily obligations of BHE, BNSF and NetJets. &nbsp; (2) &nbsp; Before reserve discounts of $1.4 billion. &nbsp; (3) &nbsp; Amounts represent estimated undiscounted benefits, net of estimated future premiums, as applicable. &nbsp; 52 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying, and possibly significant, degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in the financial statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Property and casualty losses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date. Except for certain workers&#146; compensation reinsurance claims, we record all liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (referred to in this section as &#147;gross unpaid losses&#148;) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets without discounting for time value. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing liabilities and all techniques require significant judgments and assumptions. We believe the processes and techniques utilized best suit the underlying claims and available data. As of any balance sheet date, recorded liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the &#147;claim-tail.&#148; Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim-tails. Our liabilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 were $76.9&nbsp;billion, of which 85% related to GEICO, General Re and BHRG. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques of GEICO, General Re and BHRG follows. GEICO GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, GEICO&#146;s gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were $15.5&nbsp;billion and unpaid losses net of reinsurance recoverable were $14.4&nbsp;billion. GEICO&#146;s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (&#147;frequency&#148;) and average loss per claim (&#147;severity&#148;). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. Liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (&#147;BI&#148;), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, case development liabilities averaged approximately 25% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. For significant coverages, we test the adequacy of the aggregate liabilities for unpaid losses using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models, and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimates recorded at the end of 2015 developed downward by $61&nbsp;million when reevaluated through December&nbsp;31, 2016, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings in 2016. We modified the assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2016 as appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity results. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or less than anticipated. &nbsp; 53 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Property and casualty losses &nbsp;(Continued) GEICO&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; With respect to liabilities for BI claims, our most significant claim category, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2016. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $240&nbsp;million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the same economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. General Re and BHRG Liabilities for unpaid property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses of General Re and BHRG derive primarily from reinsurance contracts. In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk), per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contracts may not differ significantly from the information received under a primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claims or manage the claims themselves. However, loss information is often less detailed with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts. Additionally, loss information we receive through periodic reports is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide IBNR estimates to reinsurers. Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. Periodic premium and claims reports are required from ceding companies. In the U.S., such reports are generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the accounting period. Outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually, often 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. In some instances, reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks thereby creating multiple contractual intermediaries between us and the primary insured potentially compounding the claim reporting delays. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reasons. The premium and loss data we receive is through at least one intermediary (the primary insurer), so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. When received, we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company&#146;s books and records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration, litigation or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. General Re Information concerning General Re&#146;s gross and net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 follows (in millions). &nbsp; Type &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Line&nbsp;of&nbsp;business &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reported case liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,536 &nbsp; &nbsp; Liability and workers&#146; compensation &nbsp;(1) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 11,408 &nbsp; IBNR liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,884 &nbsp; &nbsp; Property &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,012 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 13,420 &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 13,420 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (693 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 12,727 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) &nbsp; Net of discounts of approximately $1.4 billion. &nbsp; 54 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Property and casualty losses &nbsp;(Continued) General Re&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; For General Re, the critical processes involved in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include the establishment of case liability estimates, the determination of expected loss ratios, which drive IBNR liability estimates, and the comparison of reported loss trends to the expected loss reporting patterns. Recorded liabilities are subject to &#147;tail risk&#148; where reported losses are beyond the expected loss emergence period. Our process for estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses begins with case loss estimates made by the ceding company. Upon notification of a reinsurance claim from a ceding company, we independently evaluate the case losses reported and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion, which were concentrated in the workers&#146; compensation line. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. In estimating IBNR liabilities, we consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. In this process, we classify all loss and premium data into segments (&#147;cells&#148;) based primarily on product type (e.g., treaty, facultative and program), line of business (e.g., auto liability, property and workers&#146; compensation) and geographic jurisdiction. For each cell, we aggregate premiums and losses by accident year, policy year or underwriting year and analyze the data over time. There are several hundred cells. We use loss triangles to determine the expected development of reported claims for most coverages, which, together with the expected loss ratios, are used to calculate IBNR liability estimates. We select expected loss ratios by cell and by year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratios and forecasted losses obtained from pricing statistics. Indicated ultimate loss ratios are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern, reported losses and earned premiums. Factors affecting our loss development triangles include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends, and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected loss emergence patterns. Once the IBNR liabilities are determined, we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year, based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. We allocate the expected losses into interim estimates, which we compare to actual reported losses. This comparison provides a test of the adequacy of prior year-end IBNR liabilities and forms the basis for possibly changing IBNR liability assumptions during the course of the year. During 2016, we reduced net losses for prior years&#146; occurrences by $280&nbsp;million in the aggregate. This reduction produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Reported claims for prior years&#146; property loss events were less than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liabilities by $157&nbsp;million. However, property losses incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss events. In 2016, reported nominal losses for prior years&#146; workers&#146; compensation were less than expected, which after reevaluating expected remaining IBNR estimates, resulted in a reduction of nominal liabilities by $165&nbsp;million. However, we discount workers&#146; compensation liabilities and after adjusting for changes in discounts, workers&#146; compensation losses for prior years&#146; occurrences had a minimal impact on pre-tax earnings. An increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in discounted workers&#146; compensation IBNR liabilities of approximately $889&nbsp;million, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. Other casualty and general liability reported losses (excluding mass tort losses) were less than expected in 2016, resulting in a $205&nbsp;million increase in pre-tax earnings. However, casualty losses tend to be long-tailed and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in a given period will continue in the future. For our significant casualty and general liability cells, we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and a five percent increase in expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900&nbsp;million. While we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates, more likely outcomes are less than $900 million given the diversification in worldwide business. &nbsp; 55 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Property and casualty losses &nbsp;(Continued) General Re&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Overall industry-wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability, such as for mass tort, asbestos and hazardous waste (collectively, &#147;mass tort&#148;) liability estimates. General Re&#146;s net liability for such losses at December&nbsp;31, 2016, was approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion, which included an increase in estimated ultimate losses of $98&nbsp;million during 2016, which produced a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings. Mass tort loss estimations are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment, and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. In addition to the previously described methodologies, we consider &#147;survival ratios&#148;, which is the average net claim payments in recent years in relation to net unpaid losses, as a rough guide to reserve adequacy. General Re&#146;s survival ratio was approximately 15 years as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. BHRG A summary of BHRG&#146;s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Property &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Casualty &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Total &nbsp; Reported case liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,556 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,399 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 3,955 &nbsp; IBNR liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,904 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,831 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,735 &nbsp; Retroactive reinsurance liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24,675 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24,675 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,460 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 31,905 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 36,365 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Deferred charges and reinsurance recoverable &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (8,509 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 27,856 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We use a variety of actuarial methodologies to establish unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Certain methodologies, such as paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, are utilized, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. A large percentage of BHRG&#146;s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive from retroactive reinsurance contracts, which relate to loss events occurring before the contract inception date. Gross liabilities with respect to such contracts were approximately $24.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016, and were predominately for casualty and liability coverages. We expect the claim-tail related to certain of these contracts to be very long. We establish aggregate liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses, and we re-estimate expected ultimate losses when significant events are reported or revealed. Certain of our contracts include significant exposures to asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. We estimate that our liabilities for such claims were approximately $13.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016. We do not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims data from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. Periodically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. Changes in ultimate estimated liabilities for prior years&#146; retroactive reinsurance contracts were relatively insignificant in 2016, as were changes in the estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid losses. In 2016, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion with respect to these contracts. &nbsp; 56 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Property and casualty losses &nbsp;(Continued) BHRG&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; We currently believe that maximum losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $40&nbsp;billion due to the aggregate contract limits that are applicable to most of these contracts. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than 15% of our year-end estimate. We also record deferred charges with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums. Unamortized deferred charges were approximately $8.0&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016, which will be amortized and charged to pre-tax earnings in the future based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charges and the amount of periodic amortization. Based on the contracts in effect as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, and the new AIG contract we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2017 will approximate $950&nbsp;million. Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities related to property and casualty contracts, other than retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $11.7&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and consisted primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. These coverages included catastrophe and aviation contracts that tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses, although such liabilities have diminished in recent years due to declines in business written. Reserving techniques for catastrophe and individual risk contracts generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. We generally establish liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustments expenses for these contracts based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies and IBNR reserves that are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on a portfolio basis, supplemented by management&#146;s estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known. In 2016, we decreased estimated ultimate losses for prior years&#146; occurrences by approximately $585&nbsp;million, which primarily derived from lower than expected losses reported by ceding companies. The decrease produced a corresponding increase in pre-tax earnings. Derivative contract liabilities We measure derivative contract liabilities at fair value. Our most significant derivative contract exposures relate to equity index put option contracts written between 2004 and 2008. We believe that the fair values produced for long-duration options are inherently subjective. Actual values in an exchange may differ significantly from the values produced by any mathematical model, as transaction values may also reflect perceptions of individual buyers and sellers as well as other changes in market conditions. We determine the fair value of equity index put option contracts using a Black-Scholes based option valuation model. Inputs to the model include the current index value, strike price, interest rate, dividend rate and contract expiration date. The weighted average interest and dividend rates used as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 were 1.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The interest rates were approximately 57 basis points (on a weighted average basis) over benchmark interest rates at the end of 2016 and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk. We believe that the most significant economic risks under these contracts relate to changes in the index value component and, to a lesser degree, the foreign currency component. The Black-Scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimates that measure potential price changes over time. Our contracts have an average remaining maturity of about four years. The weighted average volatility used as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 was approximately 20.2%. We determine the weighted average volatilities based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract&#146;s notional value. The volatility input for each contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility. The potential impact from changes in our volatility assumptions are as follows. (Dollars in millions). &nbsp; Fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $2,890 &nbsp; Hypothetical change in volatility &nbsp;&nbsp; Hypothetical&nbsp;fair&nbsp;value Increase 2 percentage points &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,098 Increase 4 percentage points &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,319 Decrease 2 percentage points &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,695 Decrease 4 percentage points &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2,516 &nbsp; 57 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Other Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December&nbsp;31, 2016 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $79.5&nbsp;billion. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our review includes determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There are several methods of estimating a reporting unit&#146;s fair value, including market quotations, underlying asset and liability fair value determinations and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, operating cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. Due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flows and earnings, actual results may vary significantly from the forecasts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then, as required by GAAP, we estimate the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Market Risk Disclosures Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. Equity Price Risk Historically, equity securities have represented a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management and at sensible prices, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee. Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, approximately 60% of the total fair value of equity securities and other investments was concentrated in five issuers. We often hold our equity investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has and will occur. We are not necessarily disturbed by market price declines provided the underlying business, economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. Market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date, fair values of these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors such as interest rates, expected dividend rates and the remaining duration of the contract. &nbsp; 58 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Equity Price Risk &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; The following table summarizes our equity securities and other investments and derivative contract liabilities with significant equity price risk as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015. We also show the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical changes does not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Indeed, results could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk We regularly invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced relative to the perceived credit risk. Our management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We strive to maintain high credit ratings so as to minimize the cost of our debt. We rarely utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks. The fair values of our fixed maturity investments and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. In addition, changes in interest rate assumptions used in our equity index put option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. The fair values of fixed interest rate instruments are usually more sensitive to interest rate changes than variable rate instruments. &nbsp; 59 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) &nbsp; Interest Rate Risk (Continued) &nbsp; The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate risk. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk, and that there are no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Variations in interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available to the issuer. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.

Foreign Currency Risk Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. We generally do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency and do not use derivative contracts to hedge or manage foreign currency price changes in any meaningful way. Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing and services subsidiaries. This translation related impact may be offset by gains or losses related to net liabilities of Berkshire and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of such liabilities due to changes in exchange rates. &nbsp; 60 Table of Contents Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&nbsp; (Continued) &nbsp; Commodity Price Risk Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks at BHE. BHE&#146;s exposures to commodities include variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supply for customers. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage and transmission and transportation constraints. To mitigate a portion of the price volatility, BHE uses derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell future production generally at fixed prices. The settled cost of these contracts is generally recoverable from customers in regulated rates. Financial results would be negatively impacted if the costs of wholesale electricity, fuel or natural gas are greater than what is permitted to be recovered in rates. The table that follows summarizes commodity price risk on energy derivative contracts of BHE as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 10% increase and a 10% decrease in forward market prices by the expected volumes for these contracts as of each date. The selected hypothetical change does not reflect the best or worst case scenarios.

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, which include words such as &#147;expects,&#148; &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;intends,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;estimates&#148; or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements. Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, losses realized from derivative contracts, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, act of terrorism or cyber attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations, changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries, changes in federal income tax laws, and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business. &nbsp; &nbsp; 61 Table of Contents Item&nbsp;7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk See &#147;Market Risk Disclosures&#148; contained in Item&nbsp;7 &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 63. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. February&nbsp;24, 2017 &nbsp; 62 Table of Contents Item&nbsp;8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Omaha, Nebraska We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. We also have audited the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013) &nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013) &nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ Deloitte&nbsp;&amp;

(1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&#147;Berkshire&#148;) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service, retailing and finance. In these notes the terms &#147;us,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; or &#147;our&#148; refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 23. Significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years are discussed in Note 2. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate a variable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and we are either obligated to absorb the losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or we hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. In particular, estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reinsurance recoverable are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Cash and cash equivalents and U.S Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts, U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less when purchased and other investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. During 2016, we acquired significant amounts of U.S. Treasury Bills with maturity dates more than three months from their purchase dates. In prior years, such investments were not material and were classified as cash equivalents. We believe that in substance these U.S. Treasury Bills are like cash as they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present an insignificant risk of change in value because of changes in interest rates. In determining the appropriate accounting classification under GAAP, we considered the relevant accounting literature. We also consulted with our independent auditors who shared with us certain insights into commonly applied practice today. We have concluded that, notwithstanding our view of the substance of such instruments, these U.S. Treasury Bills technically do not meet a &#147;bright line&#148; definition of cash equivalents under GAAP. Accordingly, we are now presenting all U.S. Treasury Bills with maturity dates greater than three months from their purchase dates separately in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we have revised the 2014 and 2015 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to reflect this change. We believe that these changes have no effect whatsoever on our financial condition. &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Investments We determine the appropriate classification of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities at the acquisition date and re-evaluate the classification at each balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Trading investments are securities acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Substantially all of our investments in equity and fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when an investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be &nbsp; 69 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; (d) Investments&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments when such other investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. In the event that net losses of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee&#146;s book value. Investment gains and losses arise when investments are sold (as determined on a specific identification basis) or are other-than-temporarily impaired. If a decline in the value of an investment below cost is deemed other than temporary, the cost of the investment is written down to fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. Factors considered in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary include: the financial condition, business prospects and creditworthiness of the issuer, the relative amount of the decline, our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value recovers and the length of time that fair value has been less than cost. With respect to an investment in a fixed maturity security, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment if we (a)&nbsp;intend to sell or expect to be required to sell the security before its amortized cost is recovered or (b)&nbsp;do not expect to ultimately recover the amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security. Under scenario (a), we recognize losses in earnings and under scenario (b), we recognize the credit loss component in earnings and the difference between fair value and the amortized cost basis net of the credit loss in other comprehensive income. &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) Receivables, loans and finance receivables Receivables of the insurance and other businesses are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Allowances for uncollectible balances are provided when it is probable counterparties or customers will be unable to pay all amounts due based on the contractual terms. Receivables are generally written off against allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. Loans and finance receivables of the finance and financial products businesses are predominantly manufactured housing installment loans. These loans are stated at amortized cost based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity and are stated net of allowances for uncollectible accounts. The carrying value of acquired loans represents acquisition costs, plus or minus origination and commitment costs paid or fees received, which together with acquisition premiums or discounts, are deferred and amortized as yield adjustments over the life of the loans. Substantially all loans are secured by real or personal property or other assets of the borrower. Allowances for credit losses on loans include estimates of losses on loans currently in foreclosure and losses on loans not currently in foreclosure. Estimates of losses on loans in foreclosure are based on historical experience and collateral recovery rates. Estimates of losses on loans not currently in foreclosure consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates and prevailing economic conditions. Allowances for credit losses also incorporate the historical average time elapsed from the last payment until foreclosure. Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. Loans over 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. Interest income accruals resume once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans in the foreclosure process are considered non-performing. Once a loan is in foreclosure, interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. &nbsp; 70 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; (f) Derivatives We carry derivative contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. The changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes are recorded in earnings or by our regulated utilities businesses as regulatory assets or liabilities when recovery through regulated rates is probable. &nbsp; &nbsp; (g) Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. &nbsp; &nbsp; (h) Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods and goods acquired for resale. Manufactured inventory costs include raw materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, approximately 55% of our consolidated inventory cost was determined using the last-in-first-out (&#147;LIFO&#148;) method, 28% using the first-in-first-out (&#147;FIFO&#148;) method, and the remainder primarily using the average cost method. The difference between costs determined under LIFO and current costs was not significant as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) Property, plant and equipment and leased assets Additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations and leased assets are recorded at cost and consist of major additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all construction related material, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an equity allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Also see Note 1(q). Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend the useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Rail grinding costs related to our railroad properties are expensed as incurred. Property, plant and equipment and leased assets are depreciated to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives or mandated recovery periods as prescribed by regulatory authorities. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When our regulated utilities or railroad retires or sells a component of the assets accounted for using group depreciation methods, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries when the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets. &nbsp; 71 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; (j) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. There are several methods that may be used to estimate a reporting unit&#146;s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, then the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value as of the current testing date. The excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the current estimated fair value of net assets establishes the implied value of goodwill. The excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized based on the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be consumed or on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. &nbsp; &nbsp; (k) Revenue recognition Insurance premiums for prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance are earned over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. In most cases, premiums are recognized as revenues ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums for retroactive property/casualty reinsurance policies are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all of the underlying loss events covered by these policies occurred in the past. Premiums for life reinsurance and annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. For contracts containing experience rating provisions, premiums earned reflect estimated loss experience under contracts. Sales revenues derive from the sales of manufactured products and goods acquired for resale. Revenues from sales are recognized upon passage of title to the customer, which generally coincides with customer pickup, product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the sales arrangement. Service revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Services provided pursuant to a contract are either recognized over the contract period or upon completion of the elements specified in the contract depending on the terms of the contract. Revenues related to the sales of fractional ownership interests in aircraft are recognized ratably over the term of the related management services agreement, as the transfer of ownership interest in the aircraft is inseparable from the management services agreement. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease. A substantial portion of our leases are classified as operating leases. Operating revenues from the distribution and sale of electricity and natural gas to customers are recognized when the services are rendered or the energy is delivered. Revenues include unbilled as well as billed amounts. Rates charged are generally subject to federal and state regulation or established under contractual arrangements. When preliminary rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is recorded. Railroad transportation revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of service provided as of the balance sheet date. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as pro-rata reductions to revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipments. When using projected shipments, we rely on historic trends as well as economic and other indicators to estimate the recorded liability for customer incentives. &nbsp; &nbsp; (l) Losses and loss adjustment expenses Liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are established under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts issued by our insurance subsidiaries for loss events that have occurred as of the balance sheet date. The liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts, except that &nbsp; 72 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; (l) Losses and loss adjustment expenses&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; amounts arising from certain workers&#146; compensation reinsurance contracts are discounted. Estimated ultimate payment amounts are based upon (1)&nbsp;reports of losses from policyholders, (2)&nbsp;individual case estimates and (3)&nbsp;estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to earnings after deducting amounts recovered and estimates of recoverable amounts under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. The estimated liabilities of workers&#146; compensation claims assumed under certain reinsurance contracts are discounted based upon an annual discount rate of 4.5% for claims arising prior to January&nbsp;1, 2003 and 1% for claims arising thereafter, consistent with insurance statutory accounting principles. The change in such discounts, including the periodic discount accretion is included in earnings as a component of losses and loss adjustment expenses. &nbsp; &nbsp; (m) Deferred charges reinsurance assumed The excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liabilities for claims and claim settlement costs over the premiums earned with respect to retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts is recorded as a deferred charge at inception of the contract. Deferred charges are subsequently amortized using the interest method over the expected claim settlement periods. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in unamortized deferred charges. Changes in such estimates are applied retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change. &nbsp; &nbsp; (n) Insurance policy acquisition costs Incremental costs that are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance contracts are capitalized, subject to ultimate recoverability, and are subsequently amortized to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. All other underwriting costs are expensed as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurance policy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were $1,991&nbsp;million and $1,920&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. &nbsp; &nbsp; (p) Life and annuity insurance benefits Liabilities for insurance benefits under life contracts are computed based upon estimated future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity, and lapse or withdrawal rates and reflect estimates for future premiums and expenses under the contracts. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract&#146;s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. Periodic payment annuity liabilities are discounted based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums. Discount rates range from less than 1% to 7%. &nbsp; &nbsp; (q) Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. &nbsp; &nbsp; (r) Foreign currency The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar. Revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting &nbsp; 73 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; (r) Foreign currency&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; period. Gains or losses from translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders&#146; equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in exchange rates, are included in earnings. &nbsp; &nbsp; (s) Income taxes Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is not likely. Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a &#147;more-likely-than-not&#148; threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. &nbsp; &nbsp; (t) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2016 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#148; ASU 2014-09 applies to contracts with customers, excluding, most notably, insurance and leasing contracts. ASU 2014-09 prescribes a framework in accounting for revenues from contracts within its scope, including (a)&nbsp;identifying the contract, (b)&nbsp;identifying the performance obligations under the contract, (c)&nbsp;determining the transaction price, (d)&nbsp;allocating the transaction price to the identified performance obligations and (e)&nbsp;recognizing revenues as the identified performance obligations are satisfied. ASU 2014-09 also prescribes additional financial statement presentations and disclosures. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2014-09 as of January&nbsp;1, 2018, under the modified retrospective method where the cumulative effect is recognized at the date of initial application. Our evaluation of ASU 2014-09 is ongoing and not complete. The FASB has issued and may issue in the future, interpretative guidance, which may cause our evaluation to change. While we anticipate some changes to revenue recognition for certain customer contracts, we do not currently believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 &#147;Financial Instruments&#151;Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.&#148; ASU 2016-01 generally requires that equity investments (excluding equity method investments) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Under existing GAAP, changes in fair value of available-for-sale equity investments are recorded in other comprehensive income. Given the current magnitude of our equity investments, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will likely have a significant impact on the periodic net earnings reported in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings, although it will not significantly impact our comprehensive income or shareholders&#146; equity. ASU 2016-01 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, with the cumulative effect of the adoption made to the balance sheet as of the date of adoption. Thus, the adoption will result in a reclassification of the related accumulated unrealized appreciation currently included in accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings, with no impact on Berkshire&#146;s shareholders&#146; equity. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 &#147;Leases.&#148; ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. &nbsp; 74 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (1) Significant accounting policies and practices &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; (t) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2016&nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 &#147;Financial Instruments&#151;Credit Losses,&#148; which provides for the recognition and measurement at the reporting date of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities. Currently credit losses are recognized and measured when such losses become probable based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 &#147;Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.&#148; ASU 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to determine implied goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption, a goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of the reporting unit&#146;s carrying value over fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. &nbsp; (2) Significant business acquisitions Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. On January&nbsp;29, 2016, Berkshire acquired all outstanding common stock of Precision Castparts Corp. (&#147;PCC&#148;) for $235 per share in cash pursuant to a definitive merger agreement dated August&nbsp;8, 2015. The aggregate consideration paid was approximately $32.7&nbsp;billion, which included the value of PCC shares we already owned. We funded the acquisition with a combination of existing cash balances and proceeds from a short-term credit facility. PCC is a worldwide, diversified manufacturer of complex metal components and products. It serves the aerospace, power and general industrial markets. PCC is a market leader in manufacturing complex structural investment castings and forged components for aerospace markets, machined airframe components and highly engineered critical fasteners for aerospace applications, and in manufacturing airfoil castings for the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. PCC also is a leading producer of titanium and nickel superalloy melted and mill products for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas and pollution control industries, and manufactures extruded seamless pipe, fittings and forgings for power generation and oil and gas applications. On February&nbsp;29, 2016, we acquired the Duracell business from The Procter&nbsp;&amp; Gamble Company (&#147;P&amp;G&#148;) pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into in November 2014. Duracell is a leading manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries and is an innovator in wireless charging technologies. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a recapitalized Duracell Company in exchange for shares of P&amp;G common stock held by Berkshire subsidiaries, which had a fair value of approximately $4.2&nbsp;billion. &nbsp; 75 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (2) Significant business acquisitions &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; During the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised the previously reported acquisition date fair values of certain identified assets and liabilities of PCC and Duracell, which primarily resulted in decreases in the amounts of identified intangible assets and deferred income tax liabilities, offset by increases in the amounts of goodwill. These revisions were immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill from these acquisitions is not amortizable for income tax purposes. The fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill of PCC and Duracell at their respective acquisition dates are summarized as follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; PCC &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Duracell &nbsp; Cash and cash equivalents &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 250 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,807 &nbsp; Inventories &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,430 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 319 &nbsp; Property, plant and equipment &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,765 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 359 &nbsp; Goodwill &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 16,011 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 866 &nbsp; Other intangible assets &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 23,527 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,550 &nbsp; Other assets &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,916 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 242 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets acquired &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 47,899 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 5,143 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,442 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 410 &nbsp; Notes payable and other borrowings &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5,251 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Income taxes, principally deferred &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,548 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 494 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities assumed &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15,241 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 904 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net assets &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 32,658 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,239 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The following table sets forth certain unaudited pro forma consolidated earnings data for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2015 as if the PCC and Duracell acquisitions were consummated on the same terms at the beginning of 2015 (in millions, except per share amount). Pro forma data for 2016 was not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Revenues &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 221,897 &nbsp; Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24,575 &nbsp; Net earnings per equivalent Class&nbsp;A common share &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 14,956 &nbsp; &nbsp; In the first quarter of 2015, we acquired the Van Tuyl Group (now named Berkshire Hathaway Automotive), which included 81 automotive dealerships and two related insurance businesses, two auto auctions and a distributor of automotive fluid maintenance products. In addition to selling new and pre-owned automobiles, the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive group offers repair and other services and products, including extended warranty services and other automotive protection plans. Consideration paid for the acquisition was $4.1&nbsp;billion. On December&nbsp;1, 2014, we acquired AltaLink, L.P. (&#147;AltaLink&#148;) for a cash purchase price of C$3.1&nbsp;billion (approximately $2.7 billion). AltaLink is a regulated electric transmission-only business, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. The goodwill related to the AltaLink acquisition is not amortizable for income tax purposes, while substantially all of the goodwill related to Berkshire Hathaway Automotive is amortizable for income tax purposes. The fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill of Berkshire Hathaway Automotive and AltaLink at their respective acquisition dates are summarized as follows (in millions). &nbsp; 76 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (2) Significant business acquisitions &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Berkshire&nbsp;Hathaway Automotive &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; AltaLink &nbsp; Cash and investments &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,274 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15 &nbsp; Property, plant and equipment &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,045 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5,610 &nbsp; Goodwill &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,833 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,744 &nbsp; Other assets &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,488 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 300 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assets acquired &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,640 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 7,669 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,399 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,090 &nbsp; Notes payable and other borrowings &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,129 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,851 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities assumed &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,528 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,941 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net assets &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,112 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,728 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On January&nbsp;1, 2014, we acquired the beverage dispensing equipment manufacturing and merchandising business of British engineering company, IMI plc for approximately $1.12&nbsp;billion. On February&nbsp;25, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (&#147;PSPI&#148;), a company providing oil flow improvement products to customers worldwide, from Phillips 66 (&#147;PSX&#148;) in exchange for 17,422,615 shares of PSX common stock with an aggregate fair value of $1.35&nbsp;billion. On June&nbsp;30, 2014, we acquired WPLG, Inc. (&#147;WPLG&#148;) from Graham Holding Company (&#147;GHC&#148;) in exchange for 1,620,190 shares of GHC common stock with an aggregate fair value of $1.13&nbsp;billion. WPLG operates a Miami, Florida, ABC affiliated television station. At their respective acquisition dates, assets of PSPI and WPLG included cash of $778&nbsp;million. WPLG assets also included 2,107 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class&nbsp;A and 1,278 shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock. The aggregate fair value of the identified net assets related to these acquisitions was approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion and the residual goodwill was approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion. During the last three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, primarily &#147;bolt-on&#148; acquisitions by our existing business operations. Aggregate consideration paid for these other business acquisitions was approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion in 2016, $1.1&nbsp;billion in 2015 and $1.8&nbsp;billion in 2014. We do not believe that these acquisitions were material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. &nbsp; (3) Investments in fixed maturity securities Investments in securities with fixed maturities as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized by type below (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Amortized Cost &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Unrealized Gains &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Unrealized Losses &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair Value &nbsp; December&nbsp;31, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,519 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 16 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (8 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 4,527 &nbsp; States, municipalities and political subdivisions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,159 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 58 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,216 &nbsp; Foreign governments &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,860 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 207 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (66 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9,001 &nbsp; Corporate bonds &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,899 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 714 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (9 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7,604 &nbsp; Mortgage-backed securities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 997 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 126 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (6 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,117 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 22,434 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,121 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (90 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 23,465 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; December&nbsp;31, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 3,425 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (8 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,427 &nbsp; States, municipalities and political subdivisions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,695 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 71 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (2 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,764 &nbsp; Foreign governments &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11,327 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 226 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (85 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11,468 &nbsp; Corporate bonds &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,323 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 632 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (29 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7,926 &nbsp; Mortgage-backed securities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,279 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 168 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (5 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,442 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 25,049 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,107 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (129 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 26,027 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 77 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (3) Investments in fixed maturity securities &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Investments in fixed maturity securities are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Insurance and other &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 23,432 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 25,988 &nbsp; Finance and financial products &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 33 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 39 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 23,465 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 26,027 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Investments in foreign government securities include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well as instruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities.

Pursuant to certain put and call provisions in the shareholder agreement, up to 50% of our original investment was redeemable over a 90-day period scheduled to begin on October&nbsp;6, 2016. In September 2016, pursuant to an agreement entered into in August 2016, Mars acquired all of our Wrigley preferred stock for approximately $4.56&nbsp;billion, which included a prorated dividend that would have otherwise been payable in October 2016. In 2009, we acquired 3,000,000 shares of Series A Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Dow (&#147;Dow Preferred&#148;) for approximately $3&nbsp;billion. In December 2016, Dow exercised its option to convert the Dow Preferred into 72.6&nbsp;million shares of common stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, all shares of common stock received upon the conversion had been sold. The Dow Preferred was entitled to dividends at a rate of 8.5%&nbsp;per annum. We currently own 50,000 shares of 6% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of BAC (&#147;BAC Preferred&#148;) with a liquidation value of $100,000 per share and warrants to purchase 700,000,000 shares of common stock of BAC (&#147;BAC Warrants&#148;). The BAC Preferred is redeemable at the option of BAC beginning on May&nbsp;7, 2019 at a redemption price of $105,000 per share (or $5.25&nbsp;billion in aggregate). The BAC Warrants expire in 2021 and are exercisable for an additional aggregate cost of $5&nbsp;billion ($7.142857/share). We currently own Class&nbsp;A 9% Cumulative Compounding Perpetual Preferred Shares of RBI (&#147;RBI Preferred&#148;) having a stated value of $3&nbsp;billion. RBI, domiciled in Canada, is the ultimate parent company of Burger King and Tim Hortons. The RBI Preferred is entitled to dividends on a cumulative basis of 9%&nbsp;per annum plus an additional amount, if necessary, to produce an after-tax yield to Berkshire as if the dividends were paid by a U.S.-based company. The RBI Preferred is redeemable at the option of RBI beginning on December&nbsp;12, 2017. If not redeemed prior to December&nbsp;12, 2024, we can cause RBI to redeem the RBI Preferred. In either case, the redemption price will be 109.9% of the stated value of such shares. &nbsp; 79 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (6) Investments in The Kraft Heinz Company On June&nbsp;7, 2013, Berkshire and an affiliate of the global investment firm 3G Capital (such affiliate, &#147;3G&#148;), each made equity investments in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (&#147;Heinz Holding&#148;), which, together with debt financing obtained by Heinz Holding, was used to acquire H.&nbsp;J. Heinz Company (&#147;Heinz&#148;). Berkshire&#146;s initial investments consisted of 425&nbsp;million shares of Heinz Holding common stock; warrants, which we exercised in June 2015, to acquire approximately 46&nbsp;million additional shares of common stock at one cent per share; and cumulative compounding preferred stock (&#147;Preferred Stock&#148;) with a liquidation preference of $8&nbsp;billion. The aggregate cost of our investments was $12.25&nbsp;billion. 3G also acquired 425&nbsp;million shares of Heinz Holding common stock for $4.25&nbsp;billion. On June&nbsp;7, 2016, our Preferred Stock investment was redeemed for cash of $8.32&nbsp;billion. Prior to its redemption, the Preferred Stock was entitled to dividends at 9%&nbsp;per annum. Dividends earned on the Preferred Stock were $180&nbsp;million in 2016, $852&nbsp;million in 2015 and $720&nbsp;million in 2014 and are included in interest, dividends and other investment income. On July&nbsp;1, 2015, Berkshire acquired 262.9&nbsp;million shares of newly issued common stock of Heinz Holding for $5.26&nbsp;billion and 3G acquired 237.1&nbsp;million shares of newly issued common stock of Heinz Holding for $4.74&nbsp;billion. Immediately thereafter, Heinz Holding executed a reverse stock split at a rate of 0.443332 of a share for each share. As of that date, Berkshire owned 52.5% of Heinz Holding&#146;s outstanding common stock. On July&nbsp;2, 2015, Heinz Holding acquired Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (&#147;Kraft&#148;). Upon completion of the acquisition, Heinz Holding was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company (&#147;Kraft Heinz&#148;). Kraft Heinz is one of the world&#146;s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy products, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products. Kraft Heinz&#146;s leading brands include Kraft, Heinz, ABC, Capri Sun, Classico, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, Lunchables, Maxwell House, Ore-Ida, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Planters, Plasmon, Quero, Weight Watchers Smart Ones and Velveeta. In connection with the acquisition of Kraft, its shareholders received one share of newly issued Kraft Heinz common stock for each share of Kraft common stock and a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share. Following the issuance of these additional shares, Berkshire and 3G together owned approximately 51% of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock, with Berkshire owning approximately 26.8% and 3G owning 24.2%. We accounted for our investment in Heinz Holding common stock and continue to account for our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock on the equity method. In applying the equity method, the investor treats an investee&#146;s issuance of shares as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. As a result, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax holding gain of approximately $6.8&nbsp;billion in 2015, representing the excess of the fair value of Kraft Heinz common stock at the date of the merger over the carrying value associated with the reduction in our ownership. A summary of our investments in Kraft Heinz follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Carrying Value &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, 2015 &nbsp; Common stock &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15,345 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15,714 &nbsp; Preferred Stock &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,710 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15,345 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 23,424 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our equity method earnings (losses) on the common stock were $923&nbsp;million in 2016, $(122) million in 2015 and $(26) million in 2014. Common stock dividends received were $952&nbsp;million in 2016 and $366&nbsp;million in 2015.

The non-cash gain from the P&amp;G/Duracell exchange represented the excess of the fair value of net assets of Duracell over the cost basis of the P&amp;G stock exchanged. Gains from sales and redemptions of equity securities in 2015 included a non-cash holding gain of approximately $6.8&nbsp;billion in connection with our investment in Kraft Heinz common stock (see Note 6). Gains from sales and redemptions of equity securities during 2014 included non-cash holding gains of approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion from the exchange of Phillips 66 (&#147;PSX&#148;) common stock in connection with the acquisition of Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (currently named LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. (&#147;LSPI&#148;)) and the exchange of Graham Holding Company (&#147;GHC&#148;) common stock for WPLG, Inc. (&#147;WPLG&#148;). These holding gains represented the excess of the respective fair value of the net assets of LSPI and WPLG received over the respective cost basis of the PSX and GHC shares exchanged. We record investments in equity and fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale at fair value and record the difference between fair value and cost in other comprehensive income. OTTI losses recognized in earnings represent reductions in the cost basis of the investment, but not the fair value. Accordingly, such losses that are included in earnings are generally offset by a credit to other comprehensive income, producing no net effect on shareholders&#146; equity as of the balance sheet date. In 2014, we recorded an OTTI charge of $678&nbsp;million related to our investment in equity securities of Tesco PLC. &nbsp; (8) Inventories Inventories are comprised of the following (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Raw materials &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,789 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,852 &nbsp; Work in process and other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,506 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 778 &nbsp; Finished manufactured goods &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,033 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,369 &nbsp; Goods acquired for resale &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,399 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5,917 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15,727 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 11,916 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inventories at December&nbsp;31, 2016 included approximately $3.5&nbsp;billion related to PCC and Duracell. &nbsp; 81 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (9) Receivables Receivables of insurance and other businesses are comprised of the following (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Insurance premiums receivable &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,462 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 8,843 &nbsp; Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,338 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3,307 &nbsp; Trade and other receivables &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 13,630 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11,521 &nbsp; Allowances for uncollectible accounts &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (333 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (368 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 27,097 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 23,303 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trade and other receivables at December&nbsp;31, 2016 included approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion related to PCC and Duracell.

Estimated amortization expense over the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2017 &#150; $1,383; 2018 &#150; $1,349; 2019 &#150; $1,229; 2020 &#150; $1,131 and 2021 &#150; $1,042. Intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 were $18,705&nbsp;million and $2,964&nbsp;million, respectively. Other intangible assets at December&nbsp;31, 2016 included assets of PCC and Duracell of approximately $24.8&nbsp;billion, which included approximately $13.6&nbsp;billion in customer relationships and $2.3&nbsp;billion in trade names that were determined to have indefinite lives. &nbsp; (12) Derivative contracts Derivative contracts have been entered into primarily through our finance and financial products and our utilities and energy businesses. A summary of the liabilities and related notional values of derivative contracts of our finance and financial products businesses follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; December&nbsp;31, 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Notional Value &nbsp; &nbsp; Liabilities &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Notional Value &nbsp; Equity index put options &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,890 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 26,497 (1) &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,552 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 27,722 (1) &nbsp; Credit default (2) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 284 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,792 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 2,890 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,836 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) &nbsp; Represents the aggregate undiscounted amounts payable assuming that the value of each index is zero at each contract&#146;s expiration date. Certain of these contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Notional amounts are based on the foreign currency exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. &nbsp; (2) &nbsp; In July 2016, our remaining credit default contract was terminated by mutual agreement with the counterparty. We no longer have any exposure to losses under credit default contracts. The derivative contract liabilities of our finance and financial products businesses are recorded at fair value and the changes in the fair values of such contracts are reported in earnings as derivative gains/losses. We entered into these contracts &nbsp; 84 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (12) Derivative contracts &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; with the expectation that the premiums received would exceed the amounts ultimately paid to counterparties. A summary of the derivative gains/losses included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in each of the three years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Equity index put options &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 662 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,008 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 108 &nbsp; Credit default and other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 89 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (34 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 398 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 751 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 974 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 506 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The equity index put option contracts are European style options written between 2004 and 2008 on four major equity indexes. These contracts expire between June 2018 and January 2026. Future payments, if any, under any given contract will be required if the prevailing index value is below the contract strike price at the expiration date. We received the premiums on these contracts at the inception dates and therefore we have no counterparty credit risk. The aggregate intrinsic value (the undiscounted liability assuming the contracts are settled based on the index values and foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date) of our equity index put option contracts was approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $1.1&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015. However, these contracts may not be unilaterally terminated or fully settled before the expiration dates. Therefore, the ultimate amount of cash basis gains or losses on these contracts will not be determined for several years. The remaining weighted average life of all contracts was approximately four years at December&nbsp;31, 2016. A limited number of our equity index put option contracts contain collateral posting requirements with respect to changes in the fair value or intrinsic value of the contracts and/or a downgrade of Berkshire&#146;s credit ratings. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we did not have any collateral posting requirements. If Berkshire&#146;s credit ratings (currently AA from Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s and Aa2 from Moody&#146;s) are downgraded below either A- by Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s or A3 by Moody&#146;s, collateral of up to $1.1&nbsp;billion could be required to be posted. Our regulated utility subsidiaries are exposed to variations in the prices of fuel required to generate electricity, wholesale electricity purchased and sold and natural gas supplied for customers. Derivative instruments, including forward purchases and sales, futures, swaps and options, are used to manage a portion of these price risks. Derivative contract assets are included in other assets and were $142&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $103&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Derivative contract liabilities are included in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities and were $145&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $237&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Net derivative contract assets or liabilities of our regulated utilities that are probable of recovery through rates, are offset by regulatory liabilities or assets. Unrealized gains or losses on contracts accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income or in net earnings, as appropriate. &nbsp; (13) Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for each of the three years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 is presented in the following table (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Cash paid during the period for: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Income taxes &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,719 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,535 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,014 &nbsp; Interest: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insurance and other businesses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 555 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 346 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 360 &nbsp; Railroad, utilities and energy businesses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,788 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,717 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,487 &nbsp; Finance and financial products businesses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 389 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 403 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 465 &nbsp; Non-cash investing and financing activities: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Liabilities assumed in connection with business acquisitions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 16,555 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,812 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6,334 &nbsp; Equity securities exchanged in connection with business acquisitions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,239 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,478 &nbsp; Treasury stock acquired in connection with business acquisition &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 400 &nbsp; Conversions and other exchanges of investments &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,154 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,597 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (14) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses The liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as &#147;claim liabilities&#148;) under our short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (&#147;IBNR&#148;) claims.

We present incurred and paid losses under retroactive reinsurance contracts and discount accretion separately. Such amounts relate to prior years&#146; underlying loss events. Additionally, we discount unpaid losses from certain workers&#146; compensation reinsurance contracts. Discounted workers&#146; compensation liabilities at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $1.9&nbsp;billion and $2.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, reflecting net discounts of $1.4&nbsp;billion and $1.6&nbsp;billion. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions for prior years&#146; insured events of approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion in 2016, $2.0&nbsp;billion in 2015 and $2.3&nbsp;billion in 2014. In each year, these reductions derived from our direct insurance business (including private passenger automobile and medical malpractice and workers&#146; compensation coverages), as well as from reinsurance business. The reductions for our reinsurance business were primarily attributable to lower than expected reported losses from ceding companies with respect to property coverages. Estimated claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures, net of reinsurance recoverables, were approximately $15.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $14.0&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015, and included approximately $13.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $12.4&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015 from retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities. Such development could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. &nbsp; 86 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (14) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; A reconciliation of certain net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as &#147;ALAE&#148;) of GEICO, General Re, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (&#147;BHRG&#148;) and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (&#147;BH Primary&#148;) to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, along with a discussion regarding each group&#146;s liability estimation processes, follows. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (in&nbsp;millions) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unpaid losses and ALAE, net of reinsurance recoverable: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GEICO &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 12,981 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; General Re &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 13,973 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; BHRG &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10,172 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; BH Primary &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10,173 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 47,299 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Reinsurance recoverable: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; GEICO &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,084 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; General Re &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 611 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; BHRG &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 121 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; BH Primary &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,099 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,915 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Retroactive reinsurance, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 24,675 &nbsp; Other short-duration contracts, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,390 &nbsp; Discount on workers&#146; compensation reinsurance liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,433 )&nbsp; Unpaid unallocated loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,072 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 76,918 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GEICO For GEICO, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing an individual case reserve when we have insufficient time and information to make specific claim estimates and for a large number of minor physical damage claims that are paid shortly after being reported. We establish liability case loss estimates, which includes loss adjustment expenses, once the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Estimates for liability coverages are more uncertain primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The &#147;claim-tail&#148; is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date. As a result, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. GEICO&#146;s claims are counted when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts.

Case losses are reported under reinsurance contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We independently evaluate reported loss amounts and if deemed appropriate, we establish case liabilities based on our estimates. We primarily use Bornhuetter&#151;Ferguson methods to estimate IBNR amounts for claims liabilities. The expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios are the critical assumptions applicable to these estimates. Once the annual IBNR liabilities are determined, we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the next calendar year based on the prior year-end expected loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios. Liability estimates also include estimates of the impact of major catastrophe events as they become known, which rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is excluded, as such information is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. &nbsp; 88 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (14) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; General Re&#146;s incurred and paid loss and ALAE data by accident year, net of reinsurance, is presented in the following tables.

compensation, medical professional and other liability insurance. Other liability insurance includes commercial auto and general liability policies. We periodically evaluate ultimate unpaid loss and ALAE estimates for the workers&#146; compensation and general liability lines using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the Bornhuetter&#151;Ferguson and chain-ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated into groups such as coverages, territories or other characteristics. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities. For medical professional liabilities, we use a combination of the aforementioned methods, as well as other loss severity based methods. From these estimates, we determine our best estimate. Periodically, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent development based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants, and includes claim that ultimately result in no liability or payment. &nbsp; 90 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (14) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; BH Primary&#146;s incurred and paid loss and ALAE data by accident year, net of reinsurance, is presented in the following tables.

As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 approximately 83% of gross unpaid losses pertained to underlying loss events that occurred prior to January 2007. We do &nbsp; 91 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (14) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; not believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities has no practical analytical value. In establishing retroactive reinsurance liabilities, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We assign judgmental probability factors to these aggregate loss payment scenarios and an expectancy outcome is determined. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. Since the expected claim-tails are often very long, we reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to retroactive reinsurance contracts included $1.26&nbsp;billion in 2016 and $3.43&nbsp;billion in 2014 from new contracts written in those years. Incurred losses related to retroactive reinsurance contracts written in prior years were $440&nbsp;million in 2016, $631&nbsp;million in 2015 and $831&nbsp;million in 2014, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect of changes in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments. &nbsp; (15) Notes payable and other borrowings Notes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions).

In March 2016, Berkshire issued &#128;2.75&nbsp;billion and $5.5&nbsp;billion in senior unsecured notes. The notes consisted of &#128;1.0&nbsp;billion of 0.50% notes due in 2020, &#128;1.0&nbsp;billion of 1.30% notes due in 2024, &#128;750&nbsp;million of 2.15% notes due in 2028, $1.0&nbsp;billion of 2.20% notes due in 2021, $2.0&nbsp;billion of 2.75% notes due in 2023 and $2.5&nbsp;billion of 3.125% notes due in 2026. The proceeds from these debt issues were used in the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the aforementioned credit agreement, which was subsequently terminated. In August 2016, Berkshire issued $750&nbsp;million in senior unsecured notes consisting of $500&nbsp;million of 1.15% notes due in 2018 and $250&nbsp;million of floating rate notes due in 2018, to replace $750&nbsp;million of maturing debt.

In August 2016, BHFC issued $1.25&nbsp;billion of senior notes consisting of $1&nbsp;billion of 1.30% notes due in 2019 and $250&nbsp;million of floating rate notes due in 2019, primarily to replace $1&nbsp;billion of maturing debt. The borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our subsidiaries had unused lines of credit and commercial paper capacity aggregating approximately $7.6&nbsp;billion to support short-term borrowing programs and provide additional liquidity. Such unused lines of credit included about $4.0&nbsp;billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries. In addition to BHFC&#146;s borrowings, at December&nbsp;31, 2016, Berkshire guaranteed approximately $3.3&nbsp;billion of other subsidiary borrowings. Generally, Berkshire&#146;s guarantee of a subsidiary&#146;s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations. Principal repayments expected during each of the next five years are as follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2017 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2018 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2019 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2020 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2021 &nbsp; Insurance and other &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 3,329 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 3,022 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,362 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,650 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 1,824 &nbsp; Railroad, utilities and energy &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,610 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,283 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,935 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,123 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,741 &nbsp; Finance and financial products &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,317 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,706 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3,099 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 616 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 777 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,256 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 12,011 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 7,396 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,389 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 4,342 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (16) Income taxes The liabilities for income taxes reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Currently payable (receivable) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 500 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (643 )&nbsp; Deferred &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 76,959 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 63,199 &nbsp; Other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 485 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 570 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 77,944 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 63,126 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 93 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (16) Income taxes &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are shown below (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; December&nbsp;31, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Deferred tax liabilities: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Investments&#151;unrealized appreciation and cost basis differences &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 27,669 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 25,117 &nbsp; Deferred charges reinsurance assumed &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,876 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,798 &nbsp; Property, plant and equipment &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 39,345 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 36,770 &nbsp; Goodwill and other intangible assets &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 11,344 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,770 &nbsp; Other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5,550 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,555 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 86,784 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 72,010 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deferred tax assets: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (861 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (887 )&nbsp; Unearned premiums &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,021 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (927 )&nbsp; Accrued liabilities &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (3,821 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (3,487 )&nbsp; Other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (4,122 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (3,510 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (9,825 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (8,811 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net deferred tax liability &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 76,959 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 63,199 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings were approximately $12.4&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and are expected to remain reinvested indefinitely. Upon distribution as dividends or otherwise, such amounts would be subject to taxation in the U.S. and potentially in other countries. However, U.S. income tax liabilities would be offset, in whole or in part, by allowable tax credits deriving from income taxes previously paid to foreign jurisdictions. Further, repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital needed to support normal business operations. As a result, we currently believe that any incremental U.S. income tax liabilities arising from the repatriation of distributable earnings of foreign subsidiaries would not be material. Income tax expense reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for each of the three years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 is as follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Federal &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 7,796 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 9,253 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,447 &nbsp; State &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 556 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 578 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 560 &nbsp; Foreign &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 888 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 701 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 928 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 9,240 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,532 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 7,935 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Current &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,565 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 5,426 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 3,302 &nbsp; Deferred &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,675 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 5,106 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4,633 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 9,240 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,532 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 7,935 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 94 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (16) Income taxes &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; Income tax expense is reconciled to hypothetical amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate for each of the three years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 in the table below (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; Earnings before income taxes &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 33,667 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 34,946 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 28,105 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hypothetical income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 11,783 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 12,231 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 9,837 &nbsp; Dividends received deduction and tax exempt interest &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (789 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1,146 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (820 )&nbsp; State income taxes, less U.S. federal income tax benefit &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 361 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 374 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 364 &nbsp; Foreign tax rate differences &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (421 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (459 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (252 )&nbsp; U.S. income tax credits &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (518 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (461 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (333 )&nbsp; Non-taxable exchange of investments &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,143 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (679 )&nbsp; Other differences, net &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (33 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (7 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (182 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 9,240 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 10,532 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 7,935 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We are under examination by the taxing authorities in many of these jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with U.S. federal taxing authorities for years before 2010. The IRS continues to audit Berkshire&#146;s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2010 through 2013 tax years. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations will be settled within the next twelve months. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, net unrecognized tax benefits were $485&nbsp;million and $570&nbsp;million, respectively. Included in the balance at December&nbsp;31, 2016, were $369&nbsp;million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such recognition. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the differences in recognition periods would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we do not expect any material changes to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. &nbsp; (17) Dividend restrictions&#151;Insurance subsidiaries Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $13&nbsp;billion as ordinary dividends during 2017. Combined shareholders&#146; equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $136&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2016 and $124&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2015. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and the values of non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes. &nbsp; 95 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (18) Fair value measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are summarized below as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and December&nbsp;31, 2015 with fair values shown according to the fair value hierarchy (in millions).

(18) Fair value measurements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the fair values presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in an actual current market exchange. The use of alternative market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 &#151;Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 &#151;Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level&nbsp;1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 &#151;Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities.

These investments are subject to contractual restrictions on transferability and may contain provisions that prevent us from economically hedging our investments. In applying discounted estimated cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stocks, we made assumptions regarding the expected durations of the investments, as the issuers may have redemption rights. We also made estimates regarding the impact of subordination, as the preferred stocks have a lower priority in liquidation than debt instruments of the issuers. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we are subject to the aforementioned contractual restrictions and we have applied discounts with respect to such restrictions. Increases or decreases to these inputs would result in decreases or increases to the fair values of the investments. Our equity index put option contracts are illiquid and contain contract terms that are not standard in derivatives markets. For example, we are not required to post collateral under most of our contracts and certain of the contracts have relatively long durations. For these and other reasons, we classified these contracts as Level&nbsp;3. The methods we use to value these contracts are those that we believe market participants would use in determining exchange prices with respect to our contracts. We value equity index put option contracts based on the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Inputs to this model include index price, contract duration and dividend and interest rate inputs (including a Berkshire non-performance input) which are observable. However, we believe that the valuation of long-duration options using any model is inherently subjective and, given the lack of observable transactions and prices, acceptable values may be subject to wide ranges. Volatility inputs represent our expectations, which consider the remaining duration of each contract and assume that the contracts will remain outstanding until the expiration dates. Increases or decreases in the volatility inputs will produce increases or decreases in the fair values of the liabilities. &nbsp; 98 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (19) Common stock Changes in Berkshire&#146;s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock during the three years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 are shown in the table below. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Class&nbsp;A, $5 Par Value (1,650,000 shares authorized) &nbsp; &nbsp; Class&nbsp;B, $0.0033 Par Value (3,225,000,000 shares authorized) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Issued &nbsp; &nbsp; Treasury &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding &nbsp; &nbsp; Issued &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Treasury &nbsp; &nbsp; Outstanding &nbsp; Balance December&nbsp;31, 2013 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 868,616 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (9,573 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 859,043 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,178,775,092 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,408,484 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,177,366,608 &nbsp; Conversions of Class&nbsp;A common stock to Class&nbsp;B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a business acquisition &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (30,597 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (30,597 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 47,490,158 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 47,490,158 &nbsp; Treasury shares acquired &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2,107 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2,107 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,278 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1,278 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance December&nbsp;31, 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 838,019 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (11,680 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 826,339 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,226,265,250 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,409,762 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,224,855,488 &nbsp; Conversions of Class&nbsp;A common stock to Class&nbsp;B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a business acquisition &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (17,917 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (17,917 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27,601,348 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27,601,348 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance December&nbsp;31, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 820,102 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (11,680 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 808,422 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,253,866,598 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,409,762 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,252,456,836 &nbsp; Conversions of Class&nbsp;A common stock to Class&nbsp;B common stock and exercises of replacement stock options issued in a business acquisition &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (32,044 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (32,044 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 49,457,329 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 49,457,329 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance December&nbsp;31, 2016 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 788,058 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (11,680 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 776,378 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,303,323,927 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (1,409,762 )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,301,914,165 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each Class&nbsp;A common share is entitled to one vote per share.

In addition to our common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized, but none are issued. Berkshire&#146;s Board of Directors (&#147;Berkshire&#146;s Board&#148;) has approved a common stock repurchase program under which Berkshire may repurchase its Class&nbsp;A and Class&nbsp;B shares at prices no higher than a 20% premium over the book value of the shares. Berkshire may repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. Berkshire&#146;s Board authorization does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire&#146;s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings below $20&nbsp;billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any dollar amount or number of Class&nbsp;A or Class&nbsp;B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share repurchases under the program over the last three years. In 2014, we acquired WPLG, whose assets included 2,107 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and 1,278 shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, which are included in treasury stock. &nbsp;

The projected benefit obligation (&#147;PBO&#148;) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels. Benefit obligations under qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in trusts. Pension obligations under certain non-U.S. plans and non-qualified U.S. plans are unfunded and the aggregate PBO of such plans was approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change as a result of changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected invested asset returns over a period of several years. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates. A reconciliation of the pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to defined benefit pension plans for each of the two years ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp; &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; Balance beginning of year &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (1,193 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ (1,617 )&nbsp; Amount included in net periodic pension expense &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 101 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 129 &nbsp; Actuarial gains and other &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 253 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 295 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Balance end of year &nbsp;&nbsp; $ (839 )&nbsp; &nbsp; $ (1,193 )&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit sharing plans. Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions. Several plans provide for &nbsp; 102 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (21) Pension plans &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; employer matching contributions up to levels specified in the plans and provide for additional discretionary contributions as determined by management. Employer contributions expensed with respect to our defined contribution plans were $944&nbsp;million in 2016, $739&nbsp;million in 2015 and $737&nbsp;million in 2014. &nbsp; (22) Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We lease certain manufacturing, warehouse, retail and office facilities as well as certain equipment. Rent expense under operating leases was $1,573&nbsp;million in 2016, $1,516&nbsp;million in 2015 and $1,484&nbsp;million in 2014. Future minimum rental payments for operating leases having non-cancellable terms in excess of one year are as follows (in millions). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2019&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2020&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $1,337 &nbsp; $ 1,162 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 1,005 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 885 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 725 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 3,171 &nbsp; &nbsp; $ 8,285 &nbsp; Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services used in their businesses. The most significant of these relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our fractional aircraft ownership business. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, estimated future payments under such arrangements are as follows: $11.1&nbsp;billion in 2017, $4.1&nbsp;billion in 2018, $3.5&nbsp;billion in 2019, $2.9&nbsp;billion in 2020, $2.0&nbsp;billion in 2021 and $14.6&nbsp;billion after 2021. We own a 50% interest in a joint venture, Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (&#147;Berkadia&#148;), with Leucadia National Corporation (&#147;Leucadia&#148;) owning the other 50% interest. Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A significant source of funding for Berkadia&#146;s operations is through the issuance of commercial paper, which is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Leucadia is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Berkadia&#146;s maximum outstanding balance of commercial paper borrowings is currently limited to $1.5&nbsp;billion. On December&nbsp;31, 2016, Berkadia&#146;s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47&nbsp;billion. In the third quarter of 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Indemnity Company (&#147;NICO&#148;) entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company (&#147;MLMIC&#148;), a writer of medical professional liability insurance domiciled in New York. MLMIC&#146;s assets and policyholders&#146; surplus determined under statutory accounting principles as of June&nbsp;30, 2016 were approximately $5.5&nbsp;billion and $1.9&nbsp;billion, respectively. The acquisition price will be an amount equal to the sum of: (i)&nbsp;the tangible book value of MLMIC at the closing date (determined under U.S. GAAP); plus (ii) $100&nbsp;million. The acquisition will involve the conversion of MLMIC from a mutual company to a stock company. The closing of the transaction is subject to various regulatory approvals, customary closing conditions and the approval of the MLMIC policyholders eligible to vote on the proposed demutualization and sale.&nbsp;The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2017. Pursuant to the terms of agreements with noncontrolling shareholders in our less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we may be obligated to acquire their equity ownership interests. If we had acquired all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we estimate the cost would have been approximately $5.0&nbsp;billion. However, the timing and the amount of any such future payments that might be required are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners. &nbsp; (23) Business segment data Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, finance, manufacturing, service and retailing businesses. Our reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how management views those business &nbsp; 103 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; (23) Business segment data &nbsp;(Continued) &nbsp; activities. Certain businesses have been grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines, marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate local management. The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does not consider investment and derivative gains/losses or amortization of certain purchase accounting adjustments related to Berkshire&#146;s business acquisitions in assessing the performance of reporting units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to consolidated amounts. &nbsp; Business Identity &nbsp;&nbsp; Business Activity Insurance: &nbsp;&nbsp; GEICO &nbsp;&nbsp;

(&#147;Berkshire&#148;) invested $12.25&nbsp;billion in H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (&#147;Heinz Holding&#148;), an entity formed to acquire H.J. Heinz Company. Berkshire&#146;s investments included common stock and warrants and cumulative compounding preferred stock. In 2015, Berkshire exercised the common stock warrants and acquired additional shares of Kraft Heinz common stock for approximately $5.3&nbsp;billion. Thereafter, Heinz Holding and Kraft Foods Group, Inc. completed a merger, and Heinz Holding was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company (&#147;Kraft Heinz&#148;). Kraft Heinz issued additional common stock to Kraft Food holders, reducing Berkshire&#146;s ownership from 52.5% to 26.8%. Berkshire accounted for its investment in Heinz Holding common stock and continues to account for its investment in Kraft Heinz common stock under the equity method. In applying the equity method, the investor treats the issuance of shares by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. As a result, Berkshire recorded a non-cash pre-tax holding gain of approximately $6.8&nbsp;billion in 2015. In 2016, Kraft Heinz redeemed the preferred stock for cash of $8.32&nbsp;billion. On January&nbsp;8, 2016, Berkshire entered into a $10&nbsp;billion 364-day revolving credit agreement and Berkshire borrowed $10&nbsp;billion under the agreement in connection with the acquisition of Precision Castparts Corp. on January 29. In March 2016, Berkshire issued &#128;2.75&nbsp;billion and $5.5&nbsp;billion in senior unsecured notes.
