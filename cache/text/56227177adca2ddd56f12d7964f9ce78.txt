Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference. &nbsp; The following documents of the Company previously filed or furnished by the Registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), are incorporated herein by reference: &nbsp; (a) &nbsp;&nbsp; The prospectus dated December 8, 2021 filed by the Registrant with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act relating to the Registration Statement on Form F-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-260649) (the &ldquo;Form F-1 Registration Statement&rdquo;), which contains the Registrant&rsquo;s audited financial statements for the latest fiscal year for which such statements have been filed; and &nbsp; (b) The description of the Registrant&rsquo;s Class A ordinary shares which is contained in the Registrant&rsquo;s Exchange Act Registration Statement on Form 8-A filed by the Registrant with the Commission on December 7, 2021 (Exchange Act File No. 001-41129), including any amendment or report filed for the purpose of updating that description. &nbsp; In addition, all documents subsequently filed by the Registrant pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than documents or any information therein deemed to have been furnished and not filed in accordance with rules of the Commission) after the date of this Registration Statement and prior to the filing of a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement, which indicates that all securities offered have been sold or which deregisters all securities then remaining unsold, shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement and to be a part hereof from the date of the filing of such documents. &nbsp; Any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein shall be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of this Registration Statement to the extent that a statement contained herein (or in any other subsequently filed document which also is incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein), modifies or supersedes such statement. Any such statement so modified or superseded shall not be deemed, except as so modified or superseded, to constitute a part of this Registration Statement. &nbsp; Item 4. Description of Securities. &nbsp; Not applicable. &nbsp; Item 5. Interests of Named Experts and Counsel. &nbsp; Not applicable. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Item 6. Indemnification of Directors and Officers &nbsp; Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company&rsquo;s articles of association may provide indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent that it may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as providing indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. &nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s Twelfth Amended &amp; Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which became effective immediately prior to the completion of the Company&rsquo;s initial public offering, contains provisions that limit the liability of the Company&rsquo;s directors, agents and officers for monetary damages for any liability incurred by them as a result of any act or failure to act in carrying out their functions other than such liability (if any) that they may incur (i)&nbsp;arising from their own fraud, willful default or dishonesty, (ii)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or (iii)&nbsp;for any transaction from which such person derived any improper benefit. &nbsp; Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions by the members of the Company shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director, agent or officer of the Company existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director, agent or officer of the Company with respect to any acts or omissions of such director, agent or officer occurring prior to, such repeal or modification. &nbsp; Further, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers that may be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require the Company, among other things, to indemnify its directors and executive officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require the Company to advance all expenses incurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceeding. The Company believes that these agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers. &nbsp; The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are included in the Company&rsquo;s Twelfth Amended &amp; Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and in indemnification agreements that the Company has entered into with its directors and executive officers may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against the Company&rsquo;s directors and executive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit the Company and other shareholders. Further, a shareholder&rsquo;s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, the Company is not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is or was one of the Company&rsquo;s directors, officers, employees or other agents or is or was serving at the Company&rsquo;s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and the Company is not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification. &nbsp; The Company has obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to the Company&rsquo;s directors and executive officers against loss arising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public securities matters, and to use with respect to payments that may be made by the Company to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law. &nbsp; Certain of the Company&rsquo;s&nbsp;non-employee&nbsp;directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured or indemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of the Company&rsquo;s board of directors. &nbsp; Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Company has been informed that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. &nbsp; Item 7.

Undertakings. &nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes: &nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement: &nbsp; (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; &nbsp; (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this Registration Statement; and &nbsp; (iii) To include any material information with respect to the Plans not previously disclosed in this Registration Statement or any material change to such information in this Registration Statement; &nbsp; provided , however , that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement. &nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. &nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. &nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the Registrant&rsquo;s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan&rsquo;s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SIGNATURES &nbsp; Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form&nbsp;S-8 and has duly caused this Form&nbsp;S-8 Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, on the 28th day of December, 2021.&nbsp;
