By leveraging AWS's global cloud infrastructure and industry-leading generative AI capabilities, Plaud's solution automatically converts conversations into actionable insights, helping organizations improve workplace productivity and streamline content creation workflows. The company's AI-powered meeting summary solution uses advanced natural language processing to extract key information from conversations, enabling customers to capture, organize, and utilize valuable meeting content more effectively. Since the launch of its flagship product Plaud Note in June 2023, Plaud has experienced rapid international growth, expanding its presence across key markets including North America, Europe and Asia. The company's AI-powered solution addresses a critical business challenge: the inefficient capture and management of information in today's hybrid workplace environments. By leveraging AWS's global infrastructure and AI services, Plaud has transformed how organizations handle conversation data, leading to widespread market adoption with more than one million devices deployed globally as of June 2025. Using AWS's global infrastructure, Plaud delivers consistent, high-quality services to customers worldwide. Through synchronized deployments across regions, Plaud has reduced cross-region access latency by 80%. This architectural approach enables near real-time performance for speech transcription and generation services, providing customers with a seamless user experience regardless of their geographic location. To accelerate product innovation and meet rapidly evolving customer demands, Plaud implemented AWS's elastic computing and automated deployment capabilities, which reduced development cycles from several weeks to as little as a few hours and improved overall operational efficiency by 30%. The company also leverages AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service, to handle massive concurrent requests, enabling rapid system response times and seamless processing for its global user base. To optimize infrastructure costs while maintaining high performance, Plaud leverages Amazon EC2 GPU Spot Instances and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust computing resources based on demand. This architectural approach enables Plaud to efficiently serve tens of thousands of concurrent users while reducing compute costs by 50%. The company further enhanced cost efficiency by implementing Amazon EC2 Graviton4 processor-based instances, which delivered a 25% improvement in price-performance ratio for their operational workloads. Plaud built a scalable and efficient data analytics infrastructure on AWS using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for data lake storage, Amazon Aurora for operational databases, and Amazon Redshift for data warehousing to gain real-time insights into business operations, model performance, and user behavior patterns. Additionally, Plaud architected a serverless data processing pipeline using Amazon Aurora Serverless for automatic scaling, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) for real-time data streaming, and Amazon ElastiCache for in-memory caching. This modern architecture has improved data processing speeds and system response times by 30%, while reducing operational overhead. To transform massive volumes of audio data into actionable insights, Plaud implemented Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes foundation models available through a single API. Using Amazon Bedrock, Plaud can seamlessly access and switch between industry-leading foundation models to power its voice processing capabilities, while maintaining the flexibility to update models with minimal code changes. This integration has significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of voice transcription and generation, enabling Plaud to deliver more intelligent and contextually aware solutions to its customers. AWS plays a crucial role in ensuring data security and compliance for Plaud's global expansion. Through real-time security threat detection, Plaud has improved potential threat detection efficiency by 300% while ensuring 100% encryption protection for all data transmission and storage. Additionally, AWS's compliance service have helped Plaud meet customers' high standards for data security and regulatory requirements across Europe, North America, and China, reducing compliance review cycles for new region entries by 50%.
