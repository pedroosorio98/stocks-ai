In the CIB, Markets revenue rose to $8.9 billion, and we supported clients as they navigated volatile market conditions at the beginning of the quarter. Meanwhile, IB activity started slow but gained momentum as market sentiment improved, and IB fees were up 7% for the quarter. In CCB, we added approximately 500,000 net new checking accounts, which drove sequential growth in checking account balances. In Card, we launched a refreshed Sapphire Reserve along with a new Sapphire Reserve for Business, with positive early reactions and strong new card acquisitions. Finally, in AWM, asset management fees rose 10%, and we saw continued client asset net inflows of $80 billion, with client assets crossing over $6.4 trillion.” Dimon added: “Earlier this month, we announced that the Board intends to increase our common dividend for the second time this year, resulting in a 20% cumulative increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. We also repurchased $7 billion of common stock. We ended the quarter with a 15% CET1 ratio, which remains far in excess of our required capital levels. In addition, we have an extraordinary amount of liquidity, with $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities.” Dimon added: “The U.S. economy remained resilient in the quarter. The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook, however, significant risks persist – including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices. As always, we hope for the best but prepare the Firm for a wide range of scenarios.” Dimon concluded: “I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication are what set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, including consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN 2Q25 RESULTS n $774 million income tax benefit in Corporate ($0.28 increase in EPS10) CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS n Common dividend of $3.9 billion or $1.40 per share n $7.1 billion of common stock net repurchases11 n Net payout LTM11,12 of 71% FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $122.51, up 10% YoY; tangible book value per share2 of $103.40, up 11% YoY n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital3 of $284 billion, Standardized ratio3 of 15.0% and Advanced ratio3 of 15.1% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.9% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n Approximately $1.7 trillion of credit and capital13 raised YTD: n $135 billion of credit for consumers n $17 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $1.5 trillion of credit and capital for corporations and non-U.S. government entities n $37 billion of credit and capital for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Mikael Grubb (212) 270-2479 Media Contact: Michael Fusco (212) 270-2495 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. 1 Percentage comparisons are for the second quarter of 2025 versus the prior-year second quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2 For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Excluding the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares 14 and $546 million of securities losses in the prior year, noninterest revenue excluding Markets 2 was up 8%, driven by higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher auto operating lease income, higher investment banking fees and higher Payments fees .

The provision for credit losses was $ 2.8 billion. Net charge-offs of $2.4 billion, predominantly in Card Services, were up $179 million.

In the prior year, the provision was $3.1 billion, net charge- offs were $2.2 billion and the net reserve build was $821 million. The current quarter included a $774 million income tax benefit in Corporate, driven by the resolution of certain tax audits and the impact of tax regulations finalized in 2024 related to foreign currency translation gains and losses.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 5 2. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm as a whole and for each of the reportable business segments and Corporate on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year- to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by each of the lines of business and Corporate. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, refer to page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, refer to page 10 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $122.51, $119.24 and $111.29 at June 30, 2025, March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. In addition to reviewing net interest income (“NII”) and noninterest revenue (“NIR”) on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding Markets, which is composed of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Management believes these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm. For a reconciliation of NII and NIR from reported to excluding Markets, refer to page 28 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. For additional information on Markets revenue, refer to pages 81-82 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K. d. Second-quarter 2025 net income and earnings per share excluding the $774 million income tax benefit are non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding this item resulted in a decrease of $774 million (after tax) to reported net income from $15.0 billion to $14.2 billion and a decrease of $0.28 per share to reported EPS from $5.24 to $4.96 . Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
