See notes on page 14 for further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $25,146 million, $22,180 million, and $23,763 million for the third quarter of 2012, second quarter of 2012, and third quarter of 2011, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $5.7 billion, up $1.4 billion, or 34%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue, lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $25.9 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 6%, compared with the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $14.7 billion, up $2.3 billion, or 18%, from the prior year, due to higher mortgage fees and related income, higher principal transactions and higher investment banking fees. The current quarter revenue reflected $888 million of pretax extinguishment gains related to the redemption of trust preferred capital debt securities. The extinguishment gains were related to adjustments applied to the cost basis of the trust preferred capital debt securities during the period they were in a qualified hedge accounting relationship. Net interest income was $11.2 billion, down $77 4 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as well as lower average trading balances, faster mortgage -backed securit ies repayments, limited reinvestment opportunities and the runoff of higher-yielding loans, partially offset by lower deposit costs. The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion, down $622 million, or 26%, from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, down $432 million from the prior year. The decrease in the consumer provision reflected a $900 million reduction of the allowance for loan losses related to the mortgage portfolio due t o improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses . Consumer net charge-offs 1 were $2.8 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in net charge-off rates of 3. 10% and 2.84%, respectively. The increase in consumer net charge -offs was primarily due to incremental charge-offs of $825 million for certain residential loans reported in accordance with regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged off to their collateral value and to be considered nonaccrual , regardless of their delinquency status . The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $63 million compared with an expense of $127 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $34 million, compared with net recoveries of $151 million in the prior year, resulting in net recovery rates of 0.05% and 0.24%, respectively. T he Firm’s allowance for loan losses to end -of-period loans retained 1 was 2.61%, compared with 3.74% in the prior year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 13 The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $12.5 billion at September 30, 2012, up from the prior -quarter level of $11.4 billion and flat compared with the prior-year level of $12.5 billion. Before the impact of the reporting changes noted below, nonperforming assets would have been $9.5 billion for the third quarter, down from $9.9 billion in the prior quarter and $12.5 billion in the prior year. The current quarter included $1.7 billion of loans which were reported as nonaccrual in accordance with the regulatory guidance noted above. The current quarter nonaccrual loans also reflec ted the effect of regulatory guidance implemented in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of which the Firm began reporting performing junior liens that are subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due, as nonaccrual loans. Such junior li ens were $1.3 billion in the current quarter and $1.5 billion in the prior quarter. Noninterest expense was $15.4 billion, down $163 million, or 1%, compared with the prior year. Key Metrics and Business Updates:  Basel I Tier 1 common ratio (All comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted) 1  Headcount was 259,547, an increase of 2,884, or 1%. was 10.4% at September 30, 2012, compare d with 9.9% at June 30, 2012, and 9.9% at September 30, 2011. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 14 1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non -GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non -GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax -exempt sou rces. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. b. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end -of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net char ge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion, $5.7 billion and $ 4.9 billion at September 30, 2012, June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011, respectively. In IB, the ratio for th e allowance for loan losses to end -of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the IB’s allowance coverage. c. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) represen ts common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity measures the Firm’s earning s as a percentage of TCE. In management’s view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers. d. The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 commo n capital divided by Basel I risk -weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity , such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries , and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the Firm’s capital with the capital of other finan cial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as “Basel III.” In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published final rules on Basel 2.5 that will go into effect on January 1, 2013 and result in additional capital requirements for trading positions and securitizations. Also, in June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published for comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the “NPR”) for implementing Basel III, in the United States. The Firm’s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is a non -GAAP financial measure and reflects th e Firm’s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal banking agencies, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm’s estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the Firm’s businesses change, and as a result of furt her rule -making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firm’s capital position in conjunction with its capital ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firm’s capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies. e. In Card Services & Auto, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge -off and 30+ day delinquency rate s presented include loans held-for-sale. f. In the Investment Bank, the following metrics are provided excluding the impact of debit valuation adjustments (“DVA”): net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management, investors and analysts to assess the underlying performance of the business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 15 2. Additional notes on financial measures: a. Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance -based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees. b. Treasury & Securities Services firmwide metrics include certain TSS product revenue and liability balances reported in other lines of business related to customers who are also customers of those other lines of business. In order to capture the firmwide impact of TSS products and revenue, management reviews firmwide metrics such as liability balances, revenue and overhead ratios in assessing financial performance for TSS. Firmwide metrics are necessary, in management’s view, in order to understand the aggregate TSS business. c. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total n et revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS an d AM against the performance of their respective peers. d. Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card . Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the second quarter of 2012. e. The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer & Business Banking, Card Services & Auto and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to not -for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities , represents that provided by the Investment Bank.
