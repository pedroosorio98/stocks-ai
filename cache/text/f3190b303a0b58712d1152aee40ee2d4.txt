(&#147;Broadcom&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) issued a press release announcing its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November&nbsp;4, 2018 (&#147;Fiscal Year 2018&#148;). The Company will host an investor conference call on December&nbsp;6, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss these results. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the press release dated December&nbsp;6, 2018, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Item&nbsp;5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. At a regular meeting of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) of the Company held on December&nbsp;5, 2018 (the &#147;Meeting&#148;), James V. Diller notified the Board that he will not be standing for re-election as a director at the Company&#146;s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the &#147;2019 Annual Meeting&#148;). Mr.&nbsp;Diller also stepped down from his position as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Executive Committee, effective at the conclusion of the Meeting. Mr.&nbsp;Diller&#146;s decision not to seek re-election and to step down as Chairman of the Board and of the Executive Committee is not due to any disagreement between Mr.&nbsp;Diller and Broadcom. Also on December&nbsp;5, 2018, the Board elected Henry Samueli, Ph.D., an existing director, as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Executive Committee, effective at the conclusion of the Meeting. Upon his election as Chairman of the Board, Dr.&nbsp;Samueli resigned from his position as Chief Technology Officer of the Company. Dr.&nbsp;Samueli also informed the Board that he will decline all compensation for his service on the Board and as its Chairman. The unvested equity awards that the Company previously granted to Dr.&nbsp;Samueli will continue to vest, subject to the terms and conditions of the awards. In addition, the Board elected Eddy W. Hartenstein, an existing director, as Lead Independent Director, a newly created position, effective at the conclusion of the Meeting. Mr.&nbsp;Hartenstein will continue to serve as the Chairman of the Compensation Committee and as a member of the Audit and Executive Committees. Mr.&nbsp;Diller will continue to serve as a director and as a member of the Compensation and Executive Committees until the 2019 Annual Meeting. He will also continue to serve as the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. At the Meeting, the Board, with advice from its independent compensation consultant, Compensia, Inc. (&#147;Compensia&#148;), also approved certain changes to amounts payable under its non-employee director compensation program, effective immediately, as follows: &nbsp; Cash Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp; Previous Annual&nbsp;Amount &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Revised Annual&nbsp;Amount &nbsp; Board membership (payable to all non-employee directors) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 80,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 90,000 &nbsp; Additional amounts, as applicable, payable to: &nbsp; Independent Chairperson of the Board &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 150,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 150,000 &nbsp; Lead Independent Director &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 100,000 &nbsp; Chairperson of the Audit Committee &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 35,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 40,000 &nbsp; Chairperson of the Compensation Committee &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 22,500 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 22,500 &nbsp; Chairperson of the Nominating&nbsp;&amp; Corporate Governance Committee &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 18,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 20,000 &nbsp; Member of the Audit Committee (other than the chairperson) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 12,500 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 15,000 &nbsp; Member of the Compensation Committee (other than the chairperson) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,000 &nbsp; Member of the Nominating&nbsp;&amp; Corporate Governance Committee (other than the chairperson) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 6,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 10,000 &nbsp; Equity Compensation &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Annual restricted stock unit (&#147;RSU&#148;) award (target value) (1) &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 200,000 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; $ 220,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) &nbsp; Grants for new directors are pro-rated, based on the expected portion of a year served prior to the annual meeting of stockholders following the date of appointment to the Board. At the Meeting, the Board also approved the Company&#146;s Fiscal Year 2019 Annual Performance Bonus Plan for Executive Employees (the &#147;Plan&#148;), which is the Company&#146;s performance-based annual cash incentive bonus plan for its executive management employees for its fiscal year ending November&nbsp;3, 2019. The terms of the Plan are substantially the same as the Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Performance Bonus Plan for Executive Employees, adopted in respect of the Company&#146;s Fiscal Year 2018, other than with regard to the applicable annual performance metrics. The disclosure under the heading &#147;Multi-Year Equity Grant Program&#148; in Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is hereby incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference. Item&nbsp;8.01. Other Events. Quarterly Dividend On&nbsp;December 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company&#146;s common stock (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;) of&nbsp;$2.65 per share. The dividend is payable on&nbsp;December 28, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m.), Eastern Time, on December&nbsp;19, 2018. Multi-Year Equity Grant Program On December&nbsp;4, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board, with advice from Compensia, approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity grants (the &#147;Multi-Year Equity Awards&#148;) of RSUs and performance stock units (&#147;PSUs&#148;) to eligible individuals (&#147;Participants&#148;), including employees who recently joined Broadcom in connection with its acquisition of CA, Inc. (&#147;CA&#148;) and the Company&#146;s executive officers, other than Hock E. Tan, Broadcom&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer. Each Multi-Year Equity Award will vest on the same basis as four annual equity grants made on March&nbsp;15 of each year, beginning in 2019. The effective grant date for each Multi-Year Equity Award will be January&nbsp;15, 2019 and it is expected that a maximum of approximately 31&nbsp;million shares of Common Stock in aggregate will be issued pursuant to the scheduled vesting of the grants. The value of each grant is intended to approximate the value of an annual grant, consistent with the Company&#146;s historical practices. An example of a Multi-Year Equity Award of RSUs, vesting over seven years, is set forth below: &nbsp; For Illustrative Purposes Only &nbsp;&nbsp; # of RSUs Vesting On &nbsp; Multi-Year Equity Award &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/15/19 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3/15/20 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3/15/21 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3/15/22 &nbsp; &nbsp; 3/15/23 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/15/24 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/15/25 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3/15/26 &nbsp; Grant 1: 400 RSUs &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Grant 2: 400 RSUs &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Grant 3: 400 RSUs &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Grant 4: 400 RSUs &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#151;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; Total: 1,600 RSUs &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 300 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 400 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 300 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 200 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Denotes grant vesting start date No further annual equity grants will be made to the Participants until at least 2023. Hock E. Tan, Broadcom&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer, did not receive a Multi-Year Equity Award and will not receive another equity award until at least 2021. For Broadcom&#146;s senior management, 50% of their respective Multi-Year Equity Awards will be comprised of PSUs. As with PSUs awarded in recent years, vesting of these PSUs will be based on Broadcom&#146;s relative total shareholder return (compared to the S&amp;P 500) and absolute total shareholder return over four overlapping one, two, three and four-year performance periods per grant. If the absolute total shareholder return for the fourth performance period of a grant is negative, the maximum payout is limited to 100% of the total target shares for that grant. The maximum number of shares that may be earned for each grant is 200% of the total target shares for that grant. Broadcom has historically granted annual equity awards to the vast majority of its employee base to align their interests with those of its stockholders, encourage retention, and drive performance. The acquisition of CA marks an important milestone for the Company and the Multi-Year Equity Awards are intended to provide its employees with clarity regarding future compensation in order to create a powerful long-term retention incentive, as well as sharpened focus on long-term stockholder value creation. The Company also believes it is in the best interests of its stockholders to maximize the use of the remaining shares available under the Avago Technologies Limited 2009 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the &#147;Avago Plan&#148;), which expires in 2019. The Multi-Year Equity Awards will be issued out of the Avago Plan, as well as out of the Broadcom Corporation 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;BRCM Plan&#148;). The foregoing description of the Multi-Year Equity Awards does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the forms of award agreements attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 to 10.4, and incorporated herein by reference. Increase in Share Repurchase Authorization In connection with the implementation of the Multi-Year Equity Award program, on December&nbsp;5, 2018, the Board increased the Company&#146;s current share repurchase program by authorizing the repurchase by Broadcom of up to an additional $6.0&nbsp;billion (the &#147;Incremental Share Repurchase Authorization&#148;) of its Common Stock from time to time on or prior to November 3, 2019, the end of Broadcom&#146;s fiscal year 2019. As of December 4, 2018, approximately $4.2&nbsp;billion remained available under its previously authorized $12.0&nbsp;billion share repurchase authorization. As a result, the aggregate remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately $10.2 billion as of the date hereof. Repurchases of Common Stock pursuant to the Incremental Share Repurchase Authorization are intended to offset the dilution associated with the Multi-Year Equity Awards and may be effected through a variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated purchases in compliance with Rule&nbsp;10b-18&nbsp;under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and number of shares of Common Stock repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions and alternative investment or other opportunities. Broadcom&#146;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to repurchase any specific number of shares of Common Stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. &nbsp; Risk Factors The Company is filing as Exhibit 99.2 hereto risk factors related to the Company&#146;s business, which risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.
