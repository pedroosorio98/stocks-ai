Alphabet Announces First Quarter 2023 Results MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – April 25, 2023 – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.” Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering our cost base.” Q1 2023 financial highlights (unaudited) Our first quarter 2023 results reflect: i. $2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space; ii. a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment; and iii. a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less stock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full fiscal year 2023. For further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023. The following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2023 (in millions, except for per share information and percentages). Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2023 Revenues $ 68,011 $ 69,787 Change in revenues year over year 23 % 3 % Change in constant currency revenues year over year(1) 26 % 6 % Operating income $ 20,094 $ 17,415 Operating margin 30 % 25 % Other income (expense), net $ (1,160) $ 790 Net income $ 16,436 $ 15,051 Diluted EPS $ 1.23 $ 1.17 (1) Non-GAAP measure. See the table captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” for more details. Q1 2023 supplemental information (in millions, except for number of employees; unaudited) Revenues, Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), and number of employees Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2023 Google Search & other $ 39,618 $ 40,359 YouTube ads 6,869 6,693 Google Network 8,174 7,496 Google advertising 54,661 54,548 Google other 6,811 7,413 Google Services total 61,472 61,961 Google Cloud 5,821 7,454 Other Bets 440 288 Hedging gains (losses) 278 84 Total revenues $ 68,011 $ 69,787 Total TAC $ 11,990 $ 11,721 Number of employees(1) 163,906 190,711 (1) As of March 31, 2023, the number of employees includes almost all of the employees affected by the reduction of our workforce. We expect most of those affected will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements. Segment Operating Results Reflecting DeepMind’s increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs instead of within Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making . Prior periods have been recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below. As announced on April 20, 2023, we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change does not affect first quarter reporting. The group, called Google DeepMind, will be reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2023 (recast) Operating income (loss): Google Services $ 21,973 $ 21,737 Google Cloud (706) 191 Other Bets (835) (1,225) Corporate costs, unallocated(1) (338) (3,288) Total income from operations $ 20,094 $ 17,415 (1) Hedging gains (losses) related to revenue included in unallocated corporate costs were $278 million and $84 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, unallocated corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion. 2 Additional information relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (unaudited) Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs. These severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions): Severance and Related Office Space Total Cost of revenues $ 461 $ 220 $ 681 Research and development 835 247 1,082 Sales and marketing 445 35 480 General and administrative 253 62 315 Total charges $ 1,994 $ 564 $ 2,558 For segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included withi n unallocated corporate costs in our segment results. Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share. Timing of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of the year. Stock Repurchases On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law. About non-GAAP financial measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow” and “Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues” included at the end of this release.

Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods. Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions; unaudited): We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet. Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 23,509 Less: purchases of property and equipment (6,289) Free cash flow $ 17,220 Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. 9 Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues and GAAP percentage change in revenues to non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (in millions, except percentages; unaudited): We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results. Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.
