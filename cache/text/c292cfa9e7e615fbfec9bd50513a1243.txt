J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Our fourth-quarter financial results were very disappointing, driven by a loss in Investment Banking la rgely attributable to continued markdowns on leveraged loans and mortgage trading positions, as well as weak trading results. We also faced higher credit costs associ ated with continued deterioration across our loan portfolios, including a $4.1 billion addition to loan loss reserves. However, we continued to see underlying growth in many business areas. The in tegration of our recen tly-acquired Washington Mutual franchise has progressed well, and we continued to grow in Treasury & Securities Services and Commercial Banking. We also opened millions of new checki ng and credit ca rd accounts, experienced net inflows in assets under management, and gained Investment Banking market share in all major fee categories.” As of December 31, 2008, the firm reported a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8% (estimated). During the year, the firm increased its tota l allowance for loan lo sses to $23.2 billion, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 3.16% 4. Dimon commented, “While the divers ified nature of our franchise and strong capital position have enabled us to weathe r the recessionary environment so far, we added $13.9 billion to our allowance for loan losses in 2008 to keep this important component of our fortress balance sheet firmly intact.” Looking ahead to 2009, Dimon continued: “If the economic environment deteriorates further, which is a distinct possibility, it is reasonable to expect additional negative impact on our market- related businesses, continued higher loan losses and increases to our credit reserves. “We are doing our part to help stabilize the fina ncial markets and hasten recovery. We assumed risk and expended resources to assimilate Bear Stearns and Washington Mu tual. We continued to lend in a safe and sound manner -- extending more than $100 billion in new credit in the fourth quarter alone to consumers, businesses, munici palities, and non-profit or ganizations. We also prevented more than 300,000 5 foreclosures, and we plan to help more than 300,000 more families keep their homes through mortgage modifications over the next two years. In addition, we currently have billions invested in renewabl e energy projects, including wind farms and solar facilities, to provide green energy for the current and future generations.” Dimon added: “JPMorgan Chase’s management team is working diligently to manage through this very difficult business climate, and to position the franchis e to benefit when the economy eventually recovers. No matter how difficult the environment may get, we at JPMorgan Chase remain fully committed to delivering for our clients, supporting our franchise, and doing all we can to help restore broad-based economic growth and prosperity.” In the discussion below of the business segments an d of JPMorgan Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the firm as a wh ole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis.

The weaker results reflected a decrease in net reve nue and a higher provision for cr edit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was negative $302 million, a decrease of $3.5 billion from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, down 17% from the prior year. Advisory fees were $579 million, down 10% from the prior year, reflecting decreased levels of activity, partially offset by improved market share.

Fixed Income Markets revenue was negative $1.7 billion, compared with $615 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by $1.8 billion of net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments; $1.1 billion of net markdowns on mo rtgage-related exposures; w eak trading results in credit- related products; and losses of $367 million from the tightening of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities. These results were largely offset by record performance in rates and currencies and strong performance in commodities and emerging markets. Equity Markets revenue was negative $94 million, down by $672 million from the prior year, reflecting weak trading results and losses of $354 million from the tighten ing of the firm’s credit spread on certain structured liabilities, partially offset by strong client revenu e across products, including prime services. Credit Portfolio revenue was $90 million, down $232 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses was $765 million, co mpared with $200 million in the prior year, predominantly reflecting a higher allowance driv en by a weakening credit environment.

Net revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of $3.9 bil lion, or 81%, from the pr ior year. Net interest income was $4.7 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 75% , benefiting from the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit and loan spreads, and higher loan and deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.0 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 88%, as positive MSR risk management results and the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction were offset partially by a decline in mortgage production revenue. The provision for credit losses was $3.6 billion, an increase of $2.5 bi llion from the prior year, as housing price declines continued to result in significant increases in estimated losses, particularly for high loan-to-value home equity and mortgage loans.

Net revenue was $4.2 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 85%, driven by higher mortgage fees and related income, the imp act of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan spreads and higher loan balances. The increase in mortgage fees and related income was driven by higher net mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage pro duction revenue. Mortgage production revenue of $62 million was down $103 million, reflecting markdow ns of the mortgage warehouse and an increase in reserves related to the repurchase of previously-sold loans. Net mortgage servicing revenue (which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value) was $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 bi llion, or 163%, from th e prior year.

Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 38%, from the prio r year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher average managed loan balances, and wider loan spreads. These benefits were offset part ially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs.

Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $363 billion, down $16 billion due to the effect of lower markets on brokerage and custody balances, offset by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage. The provision for credit losses was $32 million, compared with negative $1 million in the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. Noninterest expense of $1.2 billio n decreased $346 million, or 22%, from the prior year due to lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the effect of the Bear Stearns merger. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Pretax margin(2) was 25%, down from 35%.  Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down $60 billion, or 5%, included: - Growth of $213 billion, or 53%, in liquidity products; and - The addition of $15 billion from the Bear Stearns merger.  Assets under management net inflows were $61 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP bas is was $17,226 million, $14,737 million, and $17,384 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, third quarter of 2008 and fourth quarter of 2007, respectively. Discussion of Results: Net income was $702 million, a d ecrease of $2.3 billion, or 76%, from the prior year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense. Managed net revenue was $19.1 billion, an increase of $833 million, or 5%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $3.2 billion, down $6.2 billion, or 66%, due to lower principal transactions revenue, which re flected net markdowns on levera ged lending funded and unfunded commitments and mortgage-related exposures, and Private Equity write-downs. Partially offsetting these declines were the gain on the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech joint venture and positive MSR risk management results. Net interest income was $15.9 bil lion, up $7.1 billion, or 80%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher tradin g-related net in terest income, higher liability and loan balances, and wider loan and deposit spreads. The managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion, up $5.4 billion, or 170%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses related to home equity, mortgage and credit card loans, as well as higher net charge-offs. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $4.3 billion, compared with $2.0 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 3.61% and 2.22%, respec tively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, compared with $308 million in the prior year, due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a weakening credit environment. Wholesale net charge-offs were $217 million, compared with net charge-offs of $25 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.33% and 0.05%, respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $12.7 billion at December 31, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $3.9 billion. Noninterest expense was $11.3 billion, up $535 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutu al transaction and additional operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger, partially offset by lower compensation expense. Key Metrics and Business Updates: (All comparisons to the prior-year quarter except as noted)  Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.8% at December 31, 2008 (estimated), 8.9% at September 30, 2008, and 8.4% at December 31, 2007.  Headcount was 224,961 at December 31, 2008, which includes 41,398 from the acquisition of Washington Mutual’s banking operations. The remaining 183,563 which includes headcount from the Bear Stearns merger, reflects an increase of 2,896 from December 31, 2007. Notes: 12 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release 1. In addition to analyzing the firm’s results on a reported basis, management analyzes the firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a managed basis, wh ich is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit card loans that have be en securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed financial information. In addition, the same unde rwriting standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer’s credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the cr edit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm’s retained interests in securitized loans. Second , managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presente d on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense. See pa ge 8 of JPMorgan Chase’s Earnings Release Financial Supplement (fourth quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase’s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. 2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors. 13 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. News Release JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(b) JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank for $1.9 billion. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price which resulted in negative goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141, nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale were written down against that negative goodwill. The negative goodwill that remained after writing down nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain.
