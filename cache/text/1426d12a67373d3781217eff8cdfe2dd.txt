We released credit reserves of $2.1 billion, as the economic outlook continues to improve and our scenarios have improved accordingly. As we have said before, however, we do not consider these scenario-driven releases core or recurring profits. These reserve calculations, while done extremely diligently and carefully, involve multiple, multi-year hypothetical probability-adjusted scenarios, which may or may not occur and which may continue to introduce quarterly volatility in our reserves. Our earnings, not including the net reserve release and an income tax benefit, were $9.6 billion.” Dimon continued: “In Consumer & Community Banking, combined debit and credit card spend was up 26%, and Card payment rates have stabilized contributing to modest Card loan growth. Originations in Home Lending remain strong, up 43% to $42 billion, and remain at historically high levels in Auto, of over $11 billion. However, CCB loans were down 2% reflecting continued elevated prepayments in mortgage and the impact of PPP forgiveness primarily offset by growth in Auto, up 12%, and Card, up 1%. In the Corporate & Investment Bank, Global IB fees were up 52% driven by a surge in M&A activity and our strong performance in IPOs. Markets revenue was very strong overall and down just 5% compared to a third quarter record last year, as continued normalization in Fixed Income offset a strong performance in Equities. Commercial Banking earned a record $1.3 billion of gross IB revenue reflecting the strength of the M&A market. CB loans were down 7%, however, we are seeing early signs of Commercial Real Estate loan growth on modestly higher new loan originations in Commercial Term Lending. In Asset & Wealth Management, AUM of $3.0 trillion grew 17% driven by higher asset values and strong net inflows, and loans continue to be strong, up 20% primarily driven by securities-based lending.” Dimon concluded: “We are making important investments, including strategic, add-on acquisitions that will drive our firm’s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades. This quarter, we became the first bank to have branches in all of the lower 48 states, allowing us to serve more households, businesses and communities across the country. We are more than halfway through our plan to open 400 branches in new markets by the end of 2022, with approximately 30% of these branches in low- to-moderate income communities. We are also expanding our retail presence internationally, most recently launching our digital retail bank in the U.K. We remain committed to using our resources to drive inclusive solutions to support our employees, customers, clients and the communities we serve.” SIGNIFICANT ITEMS n 3Q21 results included: n $2.1 billion net credit reserve release Firmwide ($0.52 increase in earnings per share (EPS)) n $566 million Firmwide income tax benefit related to finalizing the Firm’s 2020 U.S. federal tax return ($0.19 increase in EPS) n Excluding significant items 2: 3Q21 net income of $9.6 billion, EPS of $3.03 and ROTCE of 18% CAPITAL DISTRIBUTED n Common dividend of $3.0 billion, or $1.00 per share n $5.0 billion of common stock net repurchases in 3Q21 5 FORTRESS PRINCIPLES n Book value per share of $86.36, up 9%; tangible book value per share 2 of $69.87, up 9% n Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital 3 of $210 billion and Standardized ratio3 of 12.9%; Advanced ratio3 of 13.6% n Firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.5% OPERATING LEVERAGE n 3Q21 expense of $17.1 billion; reported overhead ratio of 58%; managed overhead ratio2 of 56% SUPPORTED CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES & COMMUNITIES n $2.4 trillion of credit and capital9 raised YTD n $238 billion of credit for consumers n $15 billion of credit for U.S. small businesses n $957 billion of credit for corporations n $1.2 trillion of capital raised for corporate clients and non-U.S. government entities n $46 billion of credit and capital raised for nonprofit and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities n $11 billion of loans under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) YTD JPMorgan Chase & Co. 383 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10179-0001 NYSE symbol: JPM www.jpmorganchase.com Investor Contact: Reggie Chambers (212) 270-2479 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1Percentage comparisons noted in the bullet points are for the third quarter of 2021 versus the prior-year third quarter, unless otherwise specified. 2For notes on non-GAAP financial measures, including managed basis reporting, see page 6.

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures: a. The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax- exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. b. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $ 86.36, $ 84.85 and $ 79.08 at September 30, 2021 , June 30, 2021 , and September 30, 2020 , respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. c. Third-quarter 2021 net income, earnings per share and ROTCE excluding the Firmwide net credit reserve release and income tax benefit (collectively, “significant items”) are non-GAAP financial measures. The net credit reserve release represents the portion of the provision for credit losses attributable to the change in allowance for credit losses. The income tax benefit is related to finalizing the Firm’s 2020 U.S. federal tax return. Excluding these significant items resulted in a decrease of $2.1 billion (after tax) to reported net income from $11.7 billion to $9.6 billion; a decrease of $0.71 per share to reported EPS from $3.74 to $3.03; and a decrease of 4 % to ROTCE from 22% to 18%. Management believes these measures provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing the Firm’s results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. News Release 6 Additional notes: 3. Estimated.
